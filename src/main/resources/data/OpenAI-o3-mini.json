        "answer": "For mild depression in epilepsy, first-line treatment usually includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and safe antidepressants like SSRIs (for example, sertraline or citalopram). These approaches help improve mood without significantly affecting seizure control when carefully monitored.\n\nReferences:\n1. Kanner AM.

        "answer": "First-line treatment usually involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\u2014for example, sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram\u2014because they generally do not lower the seizure threshold. If SSRIs aren\u2019t effective, a careful trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered. It\u2019s important to avoid medications like bupropion due to its higher risk of provoking seizures.\n\nRepresentative References:\n1.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is also a safe and effective option, especially if medications aren\u2019t enough.\n\nExplanation:\nBecause some drugs raise seizure risk, care is taken to select medications that are safer for the brain.
