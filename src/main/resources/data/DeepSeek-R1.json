        "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you're experiencing\u2014dizziness and disorientation while gaming\u2014could stem from several interconnected factors, given your medical history and test results. Here's a structured approach to understanding and addressing your concerns:### 1. **Non-Epileptic Causes**- **Anxiety & Dissociation**:- Your ongoing anxiety and dissociation could manifest as physical symptoms. Hypervigilance post-seizure might amplify normal sensations into perceived dizziness. Gaming, a high-focus activity, may trigger stress responses or dissociative episodes.- **Action**: Consider therapy (e.g., CBT) to address anxiety/dissociation. Mindfulness or grounding techniques during gaming sessions might help.- **Vestibular or Visual Strain**:- Fast-paced games can strain the vestibular system or cause \"simulator sickness\" (a form of motion sickness). Eye strain from screen use might also contribute, especially if exacerbated by post-seizure sensitivity.- **Action**: Try blue-light glasses, adjust screen settings (reduce brightness/contrast), take 20-20-20 breaks (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds), and ensure proper room lighting.### 2. **Medical Considerations**- **Medication Review**:- Revisit your current medications (anxiety meds or others) with a doctor. Some drugs or withdrawal effects can cause dizziness.- **Vestibular Assessment**:- Consult a neuro-ophthalmologist or ENT specialist to rule out vestibular migraines or inner-ear issues.- **Postictal Sensitivity**:- Even if tests are normal, your brain might still be recovering. Gradually reintroduce gaming while monitoring symptoms.### 3. **Lifestyle Adjustments**- **Gaming Habits**:- Limit session duration, stay hydrated, and avoid gaming when fatigued. Track symptoms in a journal to identify triggers (e.g., specific game mechanics, time of day).- **Sleep & Stress Management**:- Prioritize sleep hygiene and stress reduction (e.g., yoga, meditation) to mitigate anxiety-related symptoms.### 4. **When to Seek Further Help**- If symptoms worsen or new issues arise (e.g., headaches, vision changes), push for a follow-up neurology visit. Request a **video EEG during gaming** if feasible, though this may be challenging.- Consider a **vestibular therapist** for tailored exercises if dizziness persists.### Final ThoughtsWhile epilepsy seems unlikely given your test results, your symptoms are valid and likely multifactorial. A holistic approach\u2014addressing anxiety, optimizing gaming habits, and ruling out vestibular/visual issues\u2014should help. Stay proactive with healthcare providers and prioritize mental health support to navigate this transition."

        "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",

        "answer": "Based on the details provided, here's a structured analysis and explanation:### **1. Diagnosis of Epilepsy**- **Criteria Met**: The occurrence of two unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart typically qualifies for an epilepsy diagnosis. Even though triggers like sleep deprivation, alcohol, or temperature changes were present, these factors alone may not fully explain the seizures, especially since the second episode occurred without significant provocation.- **Normal Test Results**: Normal EEG/MRI does not rule out epilepsy. Epilepsy can be \"idiopathic\" (no clear cause) or \"cryptogenic\" (hidden cause). Up to 50% of people with epilepsy have normal EEGs, particularly if the seizure focus is deep in the brain or the EEG was not done during a seizure. MRI may miss subtle structural abnormalities.- **Response to Medication**: Lamotrigine (an antiseizure drug) effectively preventing further seizures for 3 years supports the epilepsy diagnosis.---### **2. Why Only Two Seizures?**- **Variable Triggers**: Not all triggers reliably induce seizures in every person. Genetic predisposition, brain network instability, or transient factors (e.g., hydration, stress) may play a role. Your ability to tolerate triggers like flashing lights or sleep deprivation afterward could reflect good medication control or a low baseline seizure threshold.- **Possible Seizure Types**: The events (collapse, tongue biting, postictal confusion) suggest **generalized tonic-clonic seizures**. These can occur sporadically in some forms of epilepsy (e.g., genetic generalized epilepsy), even with normal imaging/EEG.---### **3. Key Considerations**- **Head Injury (Age 4)**: Unlikely related unless MRI showed a structural lesion (which it did not).- **Substance Use**: Alcohol/weed can lower seizure thresholds in some individuals, but your second seizure occurred with minimal use. This inconsistency is common, as triggers are not always predictable.- **Sleep**: Poor sleep before the first seizure may have contributed, but the second occurred after adequate rest, highlighting the complexity of triggers.---### **4. Next Steps**- **Medication Adherence**: Continue Lamotrigine as prescribed. Sudden withdrawal can provoke seizures.- **Neurology Follow-Up**: Regular check-ins to assess medication efficacy/side effects. Discuss long-term plans (e.g., whether to taper medication after 3+ seizure-free years).- **Lifestyle Modifications**: While you\u2019ve tolerated triggers, minimizing alcohol, sleep deprivation, and dehydration is prudent.- **Advanced Testing**: If seizures recur, consider:- **Long-term EEG monitoring** (e.g., video EEG) to capture brain activity during an episode.- **Genetic testing** (if idiopathic epilepsy is suspected).---### **5. Does This Count as Epilepsy?****Yes**, based on the two unprovoked seizures and clinical response to treatment. The normal tests do not exclude the diagnosis. Your case aligns with \"idiopathic generalized epilepsy\" or \"unclassified epilepsy,\" which can have unpredictable seizure patterns and normal imaging/EEG.---### **Final Note**Your experience highlights the heterogeneity of epilepsy. While confusing, the diagnosis is valid, and the 3-year seizure-free period is encouraging. Continue working with your neurologist to optimize management and address any concerns about long-term care."

        "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The diagnosis of epilepsy can indeed be complex, and your concerns are valid. Here's a structured breakdown to clarify the situation:### **Key Diagnostic Criteria for Epilepsy (ILAE Guidelines):**1. **Traditional Criteria:** Epilepsy is typically diagnosed after two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart.2. **Updated Criteria (2014):** The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) allows diagnosis after **one unprovoked seizure** if there is a **\u226560% risk of future seizures**, equivalent to the recurrence risk after two seizures. This risk is assessed using:- **EEG findings** (e.g., epileptiform discharges like spikes or sharp waves).- **Brain imaging** (e.g., MRI showing structural abnormalities linked to seizures).- **Clinical history** (e.g., nocturnal seizures, family history).### **Role of the EEG:**- **Epileptiform Activity:** Specific patterns like **spike-and-wave discharges** or **focal sharp waves** strongly suggest a predisposition to seizures. These are termed *interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs)*.- **Not Definitive Alone:** While EEG abnormalities support a diagnosis, they are not absolute. False positives (e.g., due to migraines, brain injury) or nonspecific changes can occur. However, when combined with clinical history, they significantly increase diagnostic confidence.### **Why Did the Neurologist Change the Diagnosis?**- **EEG Findings:** The neurologist likely identified **specific epileptiform activity** that, in the context of a first seizure, meets the ILAE criteria for high recurrence risk.- **Proactive Treatment:** Starting medication after a first seizure is sometimes recommended if the EEG/MRI suggests a high likelihood of recurrence, to prevent further seizures (which carry risks like injury or SUDEP).### **Next Steps to Address Your Concerns:**1. **Ask the Neurologist:**- **Specific EEG Findings:** What exact abnormalities were seen (e.g., focal vs. generalized spikes)?- **Diagnostic Rationale:** How do these findings align with ILAE criteria for epilepsy after one seizure?- **MRI\u2019s Role:** Could structural causes (e.g., tumor, stroke) still change the diagnosis? (Note: MRI is critical to rule out underlying causes.)2. **Consider Provoked vs. Unprovoked Seizure:**- Ensure metabolic/toxic causes (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, alcohol withdrawal) were ruled out.3. **Second Opinion:** If uncertain, seek a review of the EEG/MRI by an epileptologist (neurologist specializing in epilepsy).### **Common Misdiagnosis Considerations:**- **Non-Epileptic Seizures:** Psychogenic or physiological mimics (e.g., syncope, sleep disorders) can resemble epilepsy but require different management.- **EEG Pitfalls:** Artifacts or nonspecific changes may be misinterpreted. However, epileptiform discharges are rarely false positives in adults.### **Summary:**The neurologist\u2019s diagnosis likely hinges on the combination of a first unprovoked seizure and EEG findings indicating high recurrence risk, per ILAE guidelines. The pending MRI will further clarify if structural abnormalities exist. Open dialogue with the neurologist about the specific EEG features and their interpretation will help address your concerns. If doubts persist, a second opinion is reasonable. Early treatment may be prudent to mitigate risks, but informed decision-making is key."

        "question": "Hi! 38 female, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The deferral of plasma donation for individuals with epilepsy, like yourself, is influenced by several factors rooted in donor safety and regulatory guidelines. Here's a structured breakdown:### 1. **Seizure History & Stability**- **Recency of Seizures**: Many donation centers defer donors if they\u2019ve had a seizure within a specified period (e.g., 6 months to 3 years). Your last seizure in April 2021 (~2 years ago) *might* meet some criteria (e.g., the FDA allows donation if seizure-free for 3 years and off medication, but policies vary). However, since you\u2019re still on medication, this could affect eligibility.- **Risk of Triggers**: Plasma donation can cause dehydration, stress, or electrolyte shifts, which might lower seizure thresholds. Centers may err on caution to protect donor health.### 2. **Medication Considerations**- **Lamotrigine**: While antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) like lamotrigine aren\u2019t typically disqualifying, some centers may defer donors on AEDs due to theoretical concerns about medication effects on plasma or donor safety. However, most AEDs do not meaningfully transfer into plasma at levels harmful to recipients.### 3. **Variability in Center Policies**- **Institutional Guidelines**: Some centers follow stricter internal policies, deferring all epilepsy patients regardless of control. Staff may lack nuanced training, leading to inconsistent application of rules.### 4. **Regulatory Guidelines**- **FDA Recommendations**: The FDA does not automatically disqualify people with epilepsy but advises deferral if seizures impair consciousness or occur within 3 years. However, these are guidelines, not mandates, leading to center-specific interpretations.### 5. **Next Steps**- **Consult Your Neurologist**: They can assess whether donation is safe given your seizure control and medication regimen.- **Contact Donation Centers**: Inquire directly about their specific criteria for epilepsy and medications. Centers affiliated with larger organizations (e.g., Red Cross) may have updated policies.- **Alternative Options**: If plasma donation isn\u2019t possible, consider advocacy or supporting epilepsy research in other ways.### Summary:The deferral likely stems from cautious interpretation of guidelines focusing on donor safety and potential liability. Your controlled epilepsy might not pose a medical risk, but policies vary. Proactive communication with your doctor and donation centers could clarify eligibility."

        "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I\u2019ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I\u2019m seeing that I haven\u2019t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I\u2019m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I\u2019d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it\u2019s important to me to know when it\u2019s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your history of temporal lobe epilepsy and subsequent surgery remains relevant in certain contexts, but its significance depends on the situation. Here's a structured approach to navigating this:### **Medical Contexts (Doctors, Hospitals, Medications):**1. **Always Disclose:**- Past epilepsy and brain surgery are part of your medical history. Even if resolved, they may impact:- **Anesthesia:** Certain anesthetics or medications could interact with your neurological history.- **Diagnostic Imaging:** Prior brain surgery may influence how specialists interpret MRIs or CT scans.- **Medication Risks:** Some drugs (e.g., antidepressants, stimulants) can lower seizure thresholds, though this is less critical after 17 seizure-free years.- **Cognitive/Memory Assessments:** Hippocampal resection might be relevant in evaluations for memory issues or neurological symptoms.2. **Clarify Resolution:**- State clearly: *\"History of temporal lobe epilepsy resolved after curative surgery at age 10. No seizures or medications since.\"* This helps providers prioritize relevance.3. **Consult Your Neurologist:**- Request a letter confirming your resolved status and surgery outcome. This can streamline future disclosures (e.g., for DMV, travel, or insurance).---### **Legal/Administrative Contexts (DMV, Insurance, Employment):**1. **DMV/Driving Licenses:**- Most jurisdictions require disclosure only if seizures occurred within a specified period (e.g., 6 months to 5 years). Since you\u2019ve been seizure-free for 17 years, you may no longer need to report it.- **Action:** Check your local DMV\u2019s regulations. If uncertain, provide your neurologist\u2019s clearance letter to avoid delays.2. **Insurance/Employment:**- Disclose only if explicitly asked about *\"history\"* of seizures (not current conditions). If forms ask, \"Have you **ever** had epilepsy?\" answer truthfully, but attach a note explaining resolution.- For life/disability insurance, transparency is key to avoid future disputes.---### **Key Takeaways:**- **Medical Honesty:** Always disclose in healthcare settings\u2014it ensures safe, tailored care.- **Legal Pragmatism:** For non-medical forms, follow specific guidelines (e.g., DMV rules) and use documentation (e.g., a doctor\u2019s letter) to avoid unnecessary hurdles.- **Resolution Status:** While your epilepsy is resolved, the surgical history remains a factual part of your health record.If in doubt, consult your neurologist for personalized guidance. They can help clarify terminology (e.g., \"resolved\" vs. \"history\") and provide documentation to simplify future disclosures."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you describe suggest two distinct neurological phenomena, potentially related to both migraines and epilepsy. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### **1. Visual Zigzag Flashes & Headache**- **Migraine with Aura**:- **Symptoms**: Zigzag patterns (scintillating scotomas) are classic migraine aura symptoms, typically lasting 20\u201360 minutes, often followed by a headache. Your 20-minute aura and subsequent mild headache align with this.- **Key Point**: Migraine auras are usually visual/sensory and precede headaches, though some occur without pain (acephalgic migraine).### **2. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu & Memory Uncertainty**- **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)**:- **Symptoms**: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, memory distortions, and anxiety are hallmark focal aware seizures (auras) in TLE. These episodes typically last seconds to minutes but can occasionally persist longer.- **Red Flag**: While rare, prolonged episodes (20 minutes) could indicate transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), a TLE subtype associated with brief amnesia or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.### **Key Considerations**- **Overlap/Comorbidity**: Migraines and epilepsy can coexist. Migraine aura symptoms are distinct from epileptic auras, but both involve transient neurological dysfunction.- **Diagnostic Clues**:- Migraine auras are usually longer (5\u201360 mins) vs. epileptic auras (seconds\u20132 mins).- D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is more suggestive of epilepsy, though complex migraine variants can rarely mimic this.### **Recommendations**1. **Neurology Consultation**:- **EEG**: To detect epileptiform activity, especially during or after an episode.- **MRI**: To rule out structural causes (e.g., hippocampal sclerosis in TLE, vascular issues).- **Detailed History**: Track episodes in a diary (triggers, duration, symptoms).2. **Immediate Red Flags**: Seek urgent care if you experience:- Prolonged confusion, loss of consciousness, or weakness.- Sudden changes in episode frequency/severity.3. **Management**:- **Migraines**: Acute treatments (NSAIDs, triptans) or prevention if frequency increases.- **Epilepsy**: Antiseizure medications (if confirmed), even for infrequent seizures to prevent progression.### **Conclusion**Your visual symptoms strongly suggest migraine with aura, while the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes raise concern for temporal lobe epilepsy. Both conditions require formal evaluation. Early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management and quality of life. Schedule a neurology appointment promptly to explore these possibilities."

There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",

        "answer": "Your partner's symptoms suggest a complex neurological presentation that warrants a thorough evaluation by a neurologist, ideally one specializing in movement disorders. Here's a structured summary of potential considerations and next steps:### **Possible Diagnoses**1. **Motor Stereotypies**- **Characteristics**: Repetitive, rhythmic movements (e.g., facial grimacing, body vibrations) triggered by excitement, focus, or stress. Common in neurotypical individuals and often persist into adulthood.- **Key Points**: Lack of awareness during episodes, ability to be interrupted, and lifelong history without developmental delays align with this diagnosis.2. **Paroxysmal Dyskinesias**- **Types**: Nonkinesigenic (PNKD) episodes can be triggered by emotional stress, caffeine, or fatigue. Episodes may involve prolonged dystonic or choreic movements.- **Considerations**: Emotional triggers (e.g., sports/movie intensity) and abrupt onset could fit, but daily frequency is less typical.3. **Tic Disorders**- **Characteristics**: Sudden, repetitive movements or sounds. Though tics often involve premonitory urges, lack of awareness is atypical unless comorbid with other conditions (e.g., ADHD/autism).- **Differentiation**: Complex motor tics might resemble his symptoms, but stereotypies are more likely if he lacks pre-tic urges.4. **Epilepsy Variants**- **Considerations**: Focal impaired awareness seizures or myoclonic seizures could present with rhythmic movements. However, daily frequency without postictal confusion is unusual.- **Testing Needed**: Video EEG to capture episodes and rule out epileptiform activity.5. **Functional Movement Disorder (FND)**- **Psychogenic Origin**: Possible if episodes are stress-related, but lifelong history without psychological triggers makes this less likely.### **Recommended Steps**1. **Neurological Consultation**- Seek a neurologist, preferably a movement disorder specialist. Provide detailed descriptions and **video recordings** of episodes to aid diagnosis.2. **Diagnostic Testing**- **EEG with Video Monitoring**: To rule out epileptic activity during episodes.- **Brain MRI**: To exclude structural abnormalities.- **Genetic Testing**: If paroxysmal dyskinesias are suspected (e.g., PNKD-linked genes like _MR-1_).3. **Behavioral and Pharmacological Management**- **Stereotypies**: Reassurance and behavioral therapy (e.g., habit reversal training) if socially impactful.- **Dyskinesias/Seizures**: Medications like clonazepam or anticonvulsants (e.g., levetiracetam) may be trialed.- **Tics**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBIT) or alpha-agonists (e.g., clonidine).4. **Psychosocial Support**- Address social stigma (e.g., education for peers/family) and consider counseling if episodes affect self-esteem.### **Key Takeaways**- The episodes most align with **motor stereotypies** given their rhythmic nature, triggers, and lifelong pattern.- **Paroxysmal dyskinesias** or **atypical tics** remain differentials.- **Epilepsy should be ruled out** due to the seizure-like description.Encourage your partner to document episodes (e.g., triggers, duration) and seek specialized care promptly. Early diagnosis can improve quality of life and guide effective management strategies."

If unable to reach your neurologist, visit an urgent care clinic or emergency room for assistance.4. **Seizure Precautions:**- Avoid triggers (e.g., lack of sleep, stress, alcohol).- Stay in a safe environment (avoid driving, swimming, or heights).- Have someone stay with you if possible.5. **After Restarting Keppra:**- Resume your usual dose as soon as possible. Abruptly stopping Keppra can increase seizure risk, so avoid future gaps by setting refill reminders or using a pharmacy auto-refill service.**When to Seek Emergency Care:**- If you have a seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, or difficulty breathing.- If you experience severe side effects from Ativan (e.g., respiratory distress, extreme drowsiness).**Final Note:** This guidance is not a substitute for personalized medical advice. Prioritize contacting your healthcare team immediately to address the gap in your Keppra regimen. Your safety is critical here."

        "question": "25MI don't get it. I'm awake and alert in the middle of the day. and everything's fine. I wake up early and my brain says, \\\"screw you, here's a seizure. Have fun.\\\"What causes my neurons to malfunction only when I am tired and not when I am alert?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The tendency for seizures to occur when you're tired, particularly upon waking, can be attributed to several interconnected biological mechanisms. Here's a breakdown of the key factors:1. **Sleep-Wake Cycle and Brain Rhythms**:- The transition between sleep and wakefulness involves shifts in brain activity patterns. During this transition, the thalamocortical networks (which regulate sleep rhythms) may become unstable, creating conditions prone to abnormal electrical discharges.- **Sleep deprivation** disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters like **GABA** (inhibitory) and **glutamate** (excitatory). Reduced GABA activity can lower the seizure threshold, making neurons hyperexcitable.2. **Adenosine Buildup**:- Adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleepiness, accumulates during wakefulness. High levels may influence neuronal excitability and contribute to seizure susceptibility when sleep is disrupted.3. **Specific Epilepsy Syndromes**:- Conditions like **juvenile myoclonic epilepsy** (JME) or **awakening epilepsy** are known to trigger seizures upon waking. These syndromes are linked to genetic factors that affect ion channels or neuronal networks sensitive to sleep-wake transitions.4. **Hormonal and Metabolic Changes**:- **Cortisol** (a stress hormone) peaks in the early morning, potentially affecting neuronal excitability.- Sleep deprivation alters **glucose metabolism** and **mitochondrial energy production**, which may destabilize neurons.5. **Disrupted Glymphatic Clearance**:- During sleep, the glymphatic system clears neurotoxic waste. Poor sleep quality or abrupt awakening might impair this process, allowing substances that lower the seizure threshold to accumulate.6. **Stress and Autonomic Activation**:- Waking abruptly, especially after insufficient sleep, can trigger a surge in **adrenaline**, altering autonomic nervous system activity and promoting hyperexcitability.**Next Steps**:- Consult a neurologist specializing in epilepsy to explore whether your seizures align with a specific syndrome (e.g., JME).- Consider a **sleep study** or **EEG monitoring** to identify triggers during sleep transitions.- Prioritize consistent sleep hygiene to minimize fatigue-related triggers.This interplay of neurochemical, structural, and circadian factors explains why tiredness\u2014particularly abrupt awakenings\u2014might provoke seizures despite daytime alertness. Personalized medical evaluation is crucial for targeted management."

        "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out. I was also having some breakthrough seizures in my sleep.Current meds: escitalopram 15mg q24 (recent increase) lacosamide 200mg q12 gabapentin 400mg q8-12 buspirone 5mg q12 (new) tizanidine 2-4mg before bed celecoxib 100mg q12-24 Vyvanse 30mg as needed (which I did quit for a while to see if it was the culprit. No change)Failed meds: temazepam venlafaxine lorazepam apriprazoleI just want my life back. I\u2019m under the care of a new mental health facility because I felt like the last one wasn\u2019t taking me seriously. Going to work or school is nearly impossible and I cry several times per day along with multiple panic attacks. We\u2019ve considered an IOP or inpatient hospitalization if this isn\u2019t under control soon.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The situation described is complex, involving neurological, psychiatric, and trauma-related factors. Here\u2019s a structured approach to address the concerns and work toward recovery:### **1. Neurological Reevaluation**- **Epilepsy Control:**- Seek a **comprehensive epilepsy workup**, including a **video EEG** (ambulatory or inpatient) to assess for nocturnal seizures and evaluate medication efficacy. Breakthrough seizures suggest suboptimal control; consider adjusting **lacosamide dosage** or adding/adjusting another anticonvulsant (e.g., **levetiracetam**, **lamotrigine**). Avoid medications that lower seizure thresholds.- Discuss **rescue medications** (e.g., intranasal midazolam) for acute seizure clusters.- Consult a **level 4 epilepsy center** for specialized care, especially if frontal lobe seizures are drug-resistant.- **Post-Ictal/Neurological Changes:**- Rule out **structural changes** (MRI) or **post-ictal psychosis** contributing to personality shifts. Neuropsychiatric testing may clarify cognitive/behavioral changes.---### **2. Mental Health & Trauma Support**- **Trauma-Informed Care:**- Prioritize therapies like **EMDR**, **CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy)**, or **somatic experiencing** to address medical trauma and CPTSD.- **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)** could help regulate emotions and reduce panic attacks.- Consider a **trauma-informed psychiatrist** to coordinate care with neurology.- **Medication Review:**- **Escitalopram** may worsen anxiety initially; monitor closely or consider slower titration. If ineffective, alternatives like **sertraline** or **mirtazapine** (sedating, aids sleep) could be explored.- **Buspirone** (new) may need dose adjustment (typical range: 15\u201330 mg/day).- **Vyvanse** use: Re-evaluate need given potential sleep disruption; if ADHD is comorbid, non-stimulant options (e.g., **atomoxetine**) may be safer with epilepsy.---### **3. Sleep Disturbances**- **Sleep Study:** Rule out **nocturnal seizures** or sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea). Waking at 3 AM could align with seizure activity or circadian disruption.- **Sleep Hygiene:**- Consistent routine, avoid screens at night, and trial **melatonin** (low dose) or **trazodone** (if safe with epilepsy).- Adjust timing of **gabapentin** or **tizanidine** to leverage sedative effects at night.---### **4. Medication Interactions & Adjustments**- **Review Interactions:**- **Gabapentin + tizanidine** can cause excessive sedation.- **Escitalopram + buspirone** may increase serotonin levels (monitor for serotonin syndrome).- **Failed Meds:** Avoid benzodiazepines (temazepam, lorazepam) due to prior inefficacy, but ensure rescue plans for seizures.---### **5. Coordinated Care & Advocacy**- **Integrate Care:** Ensure neurologist, psychiatrist, and therapist communicate. A **neuropsychiatrist** could bridge gaps.- **Advocacy:**- Seek second opinions if current providers are dismissive.- Document all symptoms/seizures in a journal (timing, triggers, duration).---### **6. Higher-Level Care Options**- **Inpatient/IOP:** If daily functioning remains impaired, an **intensive outpatient program (IOP)** for mental health or **epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU)** admission could provide structured support and diagnostics.---### **7. Lifestyle & Support**- **Stress Reduction:** Mindfulness, yoga, or vagus nerve exercises to modulate panic.- **Support Networks:** Connect with epilepsy advocacy groups (e.g., Epilepsy Foundation) or trauma support communities.---### **Key Takeaway**Your experience is valid, and the intersection of epilepsy, trauma, and psychiatric symptoms requires a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach. Prioritize finding providers who listen and collaborate. You deserve care that acknowledges the complexity of your situation and empowers your recovery."

        "answer": "Your symptoms suggest two distinct but potentially interconnected medical concerns that warrant thorough evaluation by healthcare professionals. Here's a structured breakdown and recommendations:### 1. **Orthostatic Symptoms (Dizziness, Heart Rate Changes)**- **Possible Conditions**:- **Orthostatic Hypotension**: A drop in blood pressure upon standing, causing dizziness/tunnel vision. Your heart rate may rise to compensate.- **POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)**: Involves a heart rate increase \u226530 bpm (or \u226540 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of standing, without significant blood pressure drop. Though you don\u2019t faint, milder forms may not involve sweating.- **Next Steps**:- **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: Check BP lying down, immediately upon standing, and after 2-5 minutes. Track this alongside heart rate.- **Tilt Table Test**: A cardiologist or neurologist may recommend this to confirm dysautonomia (autonomic dysfunction).- **Hydration/Electrolytes**: Ensure adequate salt/fluid intake, as dehydration exacerbates orthostatic intolerance.### 2. **\"Blackout\" Episodes (Altered Consciousness)**- **Possible Conditions**:- **Epilepsy (e.g., Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures)**: Symptoms like aura (nausea, sensory changes), automatisms (\"zombie-like\" behavior), and post-ictal confusion align with seizures.- **Vasovagal Syncope (Atypical)**: Prolonged pre-syncope symptoms followed by brief loss of consciousness, though continued activity is unusual.- **Migraine with Brainstem Aura (formerly Basilar Migraine)**: Can cause dizziness, vision/hearing changes, but less commonly full unconsciousness.- **Cardiac Arrhythmias**: Sudden drops in cerebral perfusion could cause syncope with residual automatisms.- **Red Flags**: Progressive worsening, family history of stroke, and loss of consciousness demand urgent evaluation.- **Next Steps**:- **Neurology Consultation**: Prioritize this. An EEG (especially during an episode) and brain MRI can rule out seizures or structural issues.- **Cardiac Workup**: EKG/Holter monitor to check for arrhythmias.- **Consider TIA/Stroke Risk**: Given family history, discuss vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) with your doctor, though TIAs are less likely in younger individuals without focal deficits.### 3. **Heat Sensitivity & Sweating**- These may tie into **autonomic dysfunction** (e.g., dysautonomia), which could explain both orthostatic intolerance and temperature dysregulation.### 4. **Connecting the Dots**- **Dysautonomia Syndromes**: Conditions like POTS often coexist with migraines or neurocardiogenic syncope. Autonomic dysfunction could contribute to both orthostatic symptoms and temperature issues.- **Metabolic/Mitochondrial Disorders**: Rare but possible if symptoms are systemic and progressive.- **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**: Consider if psychological stressors correlate with episodes, but rule out organic causes first.### **Urgent Recommendations**- **Document Symptoms**: Keep a detailed log of episodes (triggers, duration, symptoms).- **Seek Specialists**:- **Neurologist**: For EEG, MRI, and seizure evaluation.- **Cardiologist/Elektrophysiologist**: For heart rhythm and orthostatic testing.- **Autonomic Specialist**: If dysautonomia is suspected.- **Safety Measures**: Avoid driving/swimming until evaluated. Ensure someone accompanies you during episodes.These symptoms, especially the progressive blackouts, require prompt attention to rule out serious conditions and improve quality of life. Please schedule appointments as soon as possible and share your detailed history with providers. Your proactive approach is crucial\u2014don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for thorough testing."

I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the information provided, the episode you experienced could be due to either **convulsive syncope** (fainting with muscle jerks) or an **epileptic seizure**. Here's a breakdown of the key considerations:---### **1. Convulsive Syncope (Most Likely)**- **Triggers**: Hyperventilation (reduces CO\u2082, causing lightheadedness) + standing quickly (orthostatic hypotension). Your baseline low blood pressure (110/55) increases susceptibility.- **Symptoms**:- Brief loss of consciousness after standing.- Involuntary movements (leg swinging/hand scraping) lasting ~10 seconds\u2014these are often myoclonic jerks, not true seizures.- Foggy feeling afterward (common after syncope).- Possible \"dream-like\" state during unconsciousness.- **Why Syncope?**- The context (hyperventilation + standing) strongly suggests reduced cerebral blood flow.- Movements in syncope are typically brief and resolve quickly upon regaining consciousness.---### **2. Epileptic Seizure (Less Likely, but Needs Evaluation)**- **Risk Factors**: Family history of epilepsy (mother).- **Red Flags**:- Focal movements (right-sided scraping/swinging) could indicate a focal seizure.- Post-event confusion (though this can occur after syncope too).- **Why Possible?**- Hyperventilation can trigger seizures in predisposed individuals.- Automatisms (e.g., repetitive hand movements) may occur in temporal lobe seizures.---### **Next Steps**:1. **Seek Immediate Medical Evaluation**:- A doctor should rule out cardiac causes, seizures, or neurological issues.- Tests may include:- **EEG** (to check for epileptiform activity).- **Tilt-table test** (to assess for orthostatic syncope).- **ECG/Echocardiogram** (to exclude heart-related causes).- **Bloodwork** (e.g., electrolytes, glucose).2. **Monitor Symptoms**:- Report recurrence, unusual auras, or prolonged confusion.- Avoid triggers (e.g., rapid standing, hyperventilation) until evaluated.3. **Differentiating Factors**:- **Syncope**: Typically preceded by dizziness/lightheadedness; recovery is quick.- **Seizure**: May involve aura, rhythmic movements, biting the tongue, or prolonged postictal confusion.---### **Conclusion**:While the episode is **more consistent with syncope** given the triggers and context, the family history and focal movements warrant a thorough medical workup to exclude epilepsy. **Do not delay evaluation**\u2014this will ensure appropriate diagnosis and management."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The individual's case presents a complex interplay between potential underlying epilepsy, medication effects, and lifestyle factors. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Historical Context:**- **Childhood:** Treated with phenobarbital (Gardenal) until age 7, with annual EEGs until 25. This suggests early concern for seizures, though no structural abnormality was found.- **Deja-vu Episodes:** Until college, these may represent focal aware seizures (simple partial seizures), indicating a possible predisposition to epilepsy.2. **Zolpidem Misuse:**- Extreme doses (500\u2013600 mg/day) far exceed the safe limit (10 mg/day). Chronic high-dose use and abrupt cessation can lower the seizure threshold, causing withdrawal-related seizures.3. **Recent Seizures:**- Tonic-clonic seizures likely linked to Zolpidem withdrawal and/or stress/sleep deprivation. Normal neuroimaging supports a functional rather than structural cause.### **Clinical Implications:**- **Zolpidem Role:** High doses and withdrawal are known to provoke seizures. Cessation may resolve seizures if they were purely medication-induced.- **Underlying Epilepsy:** Childhood treatment and deja-vu episodes suggest a potential predisposition. Stress/sleep disruption could reactivate latent seizure activity.### **Recommendations:**1. **Neurological Follow-Up:**- **EEG Monitoring:** To detect epileptiform activity, especially if seizures recur post-Zolpidem cessation.- **Seizure Diary:** Track triggers (e.g., sleep patterns, stress) and symptoms.2. **Sleep & Stress Management:**- **Sleep Hygiene:** Consistent schedule, avoid stimulants, optimize bedroom environment.- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):** Non-pharmacological alternative for sleep.- **Stress Reduction:** Mindfulness, therapy, or support groups for burnout recovery.3. **Substance Avoidance:**- Avoid alcohol, sedatives, and other CNS depressants that lower seizure threshold.4. **Education & Support:**- **Seizure First Aid:** Ensure safety during episodes.- **Substance Withdrawal Support:** Consider counseling or groups for ongoing recovery.5. **Contingency Planning:**- If seizures persist, consult a neurologist about antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), considering her history. However, AEDs may not be needed if seizures resolve post-Zolpidem.### **Reassurance:**- The normal brain imaging is encouraging. Her proactive steps (quitting Zolpidem, building a care team) are commendable. Vigilance and lifestyle adjustments are key to preventing recurrence.### **Conclusion:**While Zolpidem misuse likely precipitated recent seizures, her history warrants cautious monitoring for underlying epilepsy. Prioritizing sleep, stress management, and neurological follow-up will mitigate risks. Celebrate her resilience in overcoming dependency, and reinforce the importance of sustained self-care."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The situation you're experiencing requires careful attention, and here's a structured approach to understanding and addressing it:### Key Considerations:1. **Seizure Triggers**:- The combination of psilocybin (shrooms), alcohol, and cannabis may have lowered your seizure threshold, even if previously tolerated. Drug interactions or variations in substance potency could play a role.- However, first-time seizures without a clear trigger warrant further investigation.2. **Postictal Fatigue**:- Fatigue and weakness after a seizure (postictal state) typically resolve within hours to a day. Prolonged fatigue (3+ days) is less common and suggests the need for further evaluation.3. **Prior Nausea**:- Persistent nausea/vomiting for a month before the seizure raises concerns. This could be unrelated (e.g., gastrointestinal issues) or part of a neurological condition (e.g., increased intracranial pressure, brainstem involvement).### Potential Underlying Causes:- **Neurological**: Structural abnormalities (e.g., tumor, lesion), epilepsy (even without family history), or non-convulsive seizure activity.- **Metabolic/Systemic**: Though blood tests were normal, intermittent issues (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, autoimmune conditions) may still be possible.- **Drug-Related**: Acute toxicity or cumulative effects of substances. Psilocybin can rarely cause seizures in susceptible individuals.- **Other**: Post-viral syndromes, autoimmune encephalitis, or cyclic vomiting syndrome (if nausea is episodic).### Immediate Steps:1. **Urgent Follow-Up**:- **Brain Imaging**: Expedite MRI/CT to rule out structural causes (tumors, bleeding, lesions).- **Neurology Referral**: Request an EEG to assess for epilepsy or abnormal brain activity. Discuss the prior nausea and fatigue.- **Review Nausea Workup**: Ensure prior tests (e.g., bloodwork, abdominal imaging) ruled out GI causes. Consider neurology input if GI evaluation was inconclusive.2. **Symptom Monitoring**:- Track fatigue severity, recurrent nausea, headaches, vision changes, or confusion. Report worsening symptoms immediately to a doctor or ER.- Avoid alcohol, cannabis, and other substances until cleared by a physician, as they may exacerbate risks.3. **Self-Care**:- Prioritize rest, hydration, and a balanced diet. Avoid strenuous activity until fatigue improves.- Consider a temporary medical leave if work exacerbates symptoms.### When to Seek Emergency Care:- Sudden worsening of fatigue, recurrent seizures, persistent vomiting, severe headache, or neurological changes (e.g., slurred speech, weakness).### Final Notes:While fatigue can occur post-seizure, its duration and your recent nausea highlight the need for thorough evaluation. Advocate for prompt imaging and specialist input. Substance use cessation is critical until underlying causes are clarified. Your proactive approach to follow-up is essential for ensuring your health and safety."

I will get an overwhelming sensation of doom/panic. My body basically forgets how to breathe. Heart rate goes up. My brain feels weird, dizzy, and fuzzy. I get hot and nauseous. I just don\u2019t feel ok, something in my head just feels very off and I\u2019m scared. These episodes last for a few seconds to a few minutes. I don\u2019t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it\u2019s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It\u2019s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn\u2019t the same feeling. I\u2019ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn\u2019t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area.

        "answer": "The symptoms you describe warrant prompt medical evaluation, as they could indicate several neurological conditions, including focal seizures. Here's a structured summary of considerations and recommendations:### Key Considerations:1. **Focal Seizures/Epilepsy:**- Symptoms like sudden light sensitivity, ictal fear (doom/panic), autonomic changes (rapid heart rate, nausea), brief episodes, and postictal fatigue align with temporal or occipital lobe seizures.- Myoclonic jerks (chin twitches) and sensory disturbances (\"shaking in a box\" sensation) may support this possibility.2. **Migraine Variants:**- **Vestibular Migraine:** Could explain dizziness, visual disturbances, and headaches but typically lasts longer (minutes to hours).- **Migraine with Brainstem Aura:** May include vertigo, tinnitus, and speech difficulties but usually has a gradual onset.3. **Medication Effects:**- **Trazodone:** Rarely lowers seizure threshold, even at low doses (25 mg). Considered unlikely but possible in predisposed individuals.- **Klonopin (Clonazepam):** An anticonvulsant; abrupt changes in dosing could theoretically influence seizure activity.4. **Other Causes:**- **Vestibular Disorders** (e.g., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) or **Meniere\u2019s Disease** (though hearing loss is typically present).- **Metabolic Imbalances** (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction).### Urgent Recommendations:1. **Neurological Evaluation:**- **EEG:** To detect epileptiform activity, especially during or immediately after an episode.- **MRI:** Rule out structural abnormalities (e.g., tumors, vascular issues).- **Blood Tests:** Check electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin B12, and magnesium.2. **Symptom Tracking:**- Document episode timing, triggers, duration, and associated symptoms. Video recording episodes may aid diagnosis.3. **Medication Review:**- Discuss trazodone and other medications with a neurologist or psychiatrist. Do not adjust doses without medical guidance.4. **Safety Precautions:**- Avoid driving or high-risk activities until evaluated.- Ensure someone is aware of your symptoms in case of escalation.### Next Steps:- **Seek Immediate Care** if episodes worsen, involve loss of consciousness, or new neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, slurred speech).- **Consult a Neurologist Specializing in Epilepsy or Migraine** for tailored assessment.Your symptoms are significant and should not be dismissed. While anxiety and medication side effects are possible, the episodic and focal nature of your symptoms strongly suggests a neurological origin. Early diagnosis is critical for effective management."

These findings might be common in conditions like autism or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which can overlap with neurological symptoms.2. **Epilepsy Diagnostic Challenges**:- **Intermittent Activity**: EEGs often miss epileptiform discharges if seizures originate in deep brain regions (e.g., mesial temporal lobe) or if no seizures occurred during the test. Your nocturnal episodes might not have been captured.- **Clinical vs. Electrodiagnostic Discordance**: Your history (tonic-clonic movements, response to levetiracetam) strongly suggests epilepsy, even without EEG confirmation. The neurologist may be acknowledging this discrepancy, emphasizing clinical judgment over a single test.3. **Consideration of Non-Epileptic Events**:- The term \u201cessentially normal\u201d might leave room for other possibilities, such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or autonomic dysfunction related to EDS. However, partial improvement on levetiracetam makes pure PNES less likely, though both conditions can coexist.4. **Underlying Comorbidities**:- **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**: Connective tissue disorders like EDS can cause dysautonomia (e.g., POTS), leading to syncope or paroxysmal episodes that mimic seizures.- **Autism**: Epilepsy is more prevalent in autistic individuals, but atypical seizure semiology (e.g., focal sensory symptoms like \u201cswooping\u201d) may complicate diagnosis.5. **Cautious Communication**:- The phrasing \u201cessentially normal\u201d may signal humility\u2014acknowledging diagnostic uncertainty while prioritizing your reported symptoms and video evidence. It also aligns with the neurologist\u2019s characterization of your case as \u201cdifficult,\u201d suggesting a need for further monitoring (e.g., long-term EEG/video telemetry) or alternative testing (e.g., genetic panels for epilepsy syndromes).### Next Steps:- **Ambulatory EEG/Long-Term Monitoring**: To capture episodes during sleep or wakefulness.- **Reevaluate Medication**: If levetiracetam is only partially effective, other antiseizure medications (e.g., lamotrigine, lacosamide) could be trialed.- **Multidisciplinary Review**: Collaboration with specialists in epilepsy, EDS, and neuropsychiatry to rule out mimics (e.g., dysautonomia, migraines) and address comorbidities.In summary, \u201cessentially normal\u201d underscores the complexity of your case, where clinical evidence and treatment response weigh more heavily than an inconclusive EEG. It\u2019s a cautious acknowledgment that the diagnosis remains presumptive but probable."

        "question": "I want to donate plasma, partially because I have O negative blood and would be available every 4 weeks to donate. And partially because I discovered donating plasma also has health benefits for the donors such as reducing micro-plastics in the body.From what I can see online in the UK if you\u2019re epileptic you can\u2019t donate plasma/blood. I was wondering if anyone knew the reason for this? Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a \u2018we\u2019re worried you may have a seizure while donating\u2019 kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it\u2019s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn\u2019t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can\u2019t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "In the UK, the restriction on individuals with epilepsy donating plasma or blood is primarily based on donor safety and regulatory precautions. Here's a breakdown of the key considerations:### 1. **Donor Safety Concerns**- **Seizure Risk During Donation**: The donation process (lasting ~45\u201360 minutes) can involve stress, dehydration, or fatigue, which may lower the seizure threshold. Even well-controlled epilepsy carries a theoretical risk of a seizure during the procedure, which could harm the donor or disrupt the process.- **Anticoagulants and Physiology**: Plasma donation uses anticoagulants (e.g., citrate), which can temporarily alter electrolyte balance (e.g., calcium levels). While no direct interaction with Keppra/Eslicarbazepine is documented, physiological changes could pose risks for individuals with neurological conditions.### 2. **Medication Considerations**- **Transfer to Recipients**: Both Keppra (levetiracetam) and Eslicarbazepine are present in plasma, but their concentrations in donated plasma are typically negligible and unlikely to affect recipients. However, regulatory bodies often err on the side of caution, deferring donors on certain medications unless proven safe.- **Lack of Specific Guidance**: The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) guidelines broadly defer individuals with epilepsy, likely due to variability in medication regimens and seizure triggers rather than specific drug risks.### 3. **Regulatory Policies**- **Blanket Deferral**: The NHSBT employs a precautionary approach, deferring conditions with even minimal risk to streamline donor eligibility. This avoids case-by-case assessments, which can be resource-intensive.- **No Exceptions for Well-Controlled Epilepsy**: Even with a doctor\u2019s note, the policy is typically non-negotiable, as it prioritizes standardized safety protocols over individual exceptions.### 4. **Microplastics and Health Benefits**- **Unproven Benefit**: While plasma donation may reduce certain circulating toxins (e.g., PFAS), evidence for microplastic reduction is limited. The primary benefit remains altruistic (helping others).### Next Steps- **Contact NHSBT Directly**: Reach out to their donor helpline to confirm the rationale and explore any possible exceptions (though unlikely).- **Advocate for Policy Review**: Engage with epilepsy charities (e.g., Epilepsy Action UK) to collaborate with NHSBT on re-evaluating eligibility criteria for stable, medicated donors.While your intention to donate is commendable, current UK guidelines prioritize safety and uniformity, leading to this restriction. You might explore alternative ways to contribute, such as advocacy or supporting epilepsy research."

She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",

        "answer": "Your friend's situation is complex and requires a comprehensive medical approach. Here's a structured summary of potential considerations and advice:### **Medical Considerations:**1. **Eclampsia/Preeclampsia:** Typically occurs after 20 weeks, but early-onset cases are rare. Blood pressure and proteinuria should be monitored.2. **Electrolyte Imbalances:**- **Low Magnesium:** Can cause seizures; supplementation may help. Investigate underlying causes (diet, absorption, renal issues).- Check other electrolytes (sodium, calcium, potassium) and glucose levels.3. **Oxygenation Issues:**- **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Pregnancy increases clotting risk. Consider D-dimer test, CT pulmonary angiogram, or Doppler ultrasound.- **Respiratory/Cardiac Causes:** Evaluate for asthma, heart arrhythmias, or other cardiopulmonary issues.4. **Neurological Causes:**- **EEG Monitoring:** To differentiate epileptic vs. non-epileptic seizures (e.g., PNES).- **MRI/CT Scan:** Rule out structural abnormalities (tumors, lesions).5. **Infection/Post-Sepsis Effects:**- Investigate for recurrent infection or residual organ damage from prior sepsis.6. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**- Consider psychological stressors (past trauma, anxiety about pregnancy). A psychiatric evaluation may be warranted.### **Immediate Recommendations:**- **Second Opinions:** Consult a maternal-fetal medicine specialist (high-risk OB/GYN) and a neurologist.- **Diagnostic Tests:**- **24-hour EEG** to capture episodes.- **Imaging:** Brain MRI (with pregnancy-safe protocols), vascular studies.- **Lab Work:** Full electrolyte panel, thyroid function, coagulation studies, infection markers.- **Oxygen Monitoring:** Continuous pulse oximetry; consider supplemental oxygen if levels drop.- **Magnesium Supplementation:** Under medical supervision to address deficiency.### **Supportive Care:**- **Multidisciplinary Team:** Involve OB/GYN, neurologist, cardiologist, and mental health professionals.- **Psychological Support:** Counseling/therapy for stress, trauma, or PNES.- **Safety Measures:** Ensure a safe environment to prevent injury during episodes.### **Follow-Up:**- **Regular Monitoring:** Frequent prenatal check-ups and neurological assessments.- **Documentation:** Keep a detailed log of episodes (triggers, duration, symptoms) to aid diagnosis.Encourage your friend to advocate for thorough testing and seek specialized care.

        "question": "22F, 110 poundsCurrent Medications- Lamictal 200 mg in the AM & PM so 400mg total a day. Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The information provided suggests a complex interplay between brain injury, lesion dynamics, and epilepsy. Here's a structured summary of the key points and conclusions:### **Could the Lesion Be Shrinking?**1. **Acute vs. Chronic Changes**: The initial lesion observed after the overdose might have included acute inflammation or edema, which can subside over time, making the lesion appear smaller on subsequent MRIs. This doesn't necessarily mean the lesion itself is healing but rather that acute swelling has resolved, leaving a smaller scar or gliotic tissue.2. **Imaging Interpretation**: Advances in MRI technology or differences in imaging techniques (e.g., higher resolution) might make the lesion appear smaller. Neurologists may also refine diagnoses over time as more data becomes available.### **Would Seizures Stop if the Lesion Shrinks?**1. **Persistent Epileptogenic Focus**: Even a small lesion or scar can act as a focus for abnormal electrical activity. The brain tissue around the lesion may have developed into an epileptogenic network, which can sustain seizures regardless of lesion size.2. **Medication Dependence**: The tight correlation between missed Lamictal doses and seizures indicates that the underlying predisposition to seizures remains. This suggests the lesion (or surrounding tissue) is still capable of generating seizures, even if smaller.3. **Kindling Effect**: Over time, untreated seizures can increase brain sensitivity to future seizures (a process called kindling). This might explain why missing a single dose now triggers seizures more readily than in the past.### **Clinical Implications**- **Continued Medication Adherence**: Strict adherence to Lamictal is critical, as the seizures are likely due to persistent hyperexcitable brain tissue, not just the lesion's size.- **Neurological Follow-Up**: Regular follow-ups with a neurologist are essential. Repeat imaging (e.g., MRI, EEG) may help monitor changes in the lesion or electrical activity.- **Possibility of Seizure Freedom**: While some patients experience reduced seizure frequency as lesions stabilize, complete cessation without medication is unlikely in this case, given the history of recurrent seizures triggered by missed doses.### **Conclusion**The lesion\u2019s apparent shrinkage likely reflects resolved acute changes rather than true healing. The seizures are controlled by medication but remain dependent on it, indicating an ongoing epileptogenic focus. While lesion reduction is a positive sign, it does not guarantee seizure freedom. Long-term management should focus on medication adherence and regular neurological evaluation to optimize care."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "**Answer:**When switching from **Trokendi XR (extended-release topiramate)** to **generic immediate-release topiramate**, the dosing frequency typically changes. Here\u2019s what you need to know:1. **Dosing Adjustment**:- **Trokendi XR** is taken **once daily** (extended-release).- **Generic topiramate (immediate-release)** is usually taken **twice daily** (morning and evening) to maintain steady drug levels.- Your total daily dose may stay the same, but it will likely be split into two doses. For example, if you took 100 mg Trokendi XR once daily, you might switch to 50 mg immediate-release twice daily. **Confirm this with your neurologist or pharmacist.**2. **Key Steps**:- **Contact your neurologist or pharmacist** to verify the dosing schedule and total daily dose. Do not assume it\u2019s a 1:1 switch without confirmation.- Check the prescription instructions carefully. If the label says \u201ctake once daily,\u201d clarify immediately, as this could be an error.3. **Monitoring**:- Immediate-release formulations may cause more fluctuations in drug levels, potentially increasing side effects (e.g., drowsiness, tingling, cognitive changes). Track any new symptoms.- Ensure the transition doesn\u2019t disrupt seizure control. Report changes in seizure frequency or severity to your doctor promptly.4. **Why This Matters**:- Extended-release and immediate-release formulations are not directly interchangeable without adjusting the dosing schedule. Taking immediate-release once daily could lead to subtherapeutic levels and breakthrough seizures.**Next Steps**:- Call your neurologist\u2019s office or pharmacist **today** to confirm the correct dosing.

Your symptoms overlap with several conditions, and while I can\u2019t diagnose you, here\u2019s a breakdown of possibilities and suggestions to discuss with your doctors:---### **Key Considerations Based on Your History**1. **Migraine with Aura (Status Migrainosus)**- A month-long migraine could be **status migrainosus**, a severe, persistent migraine. Aimovig (a CGRP inhibitor) can take weeks to work, and one shot may not be enough. Ask your neurologist about:- **Acute rescue therapies** (e.g., IV magnesium, steroids, nerve blocks).- **Adjusting prevention** (e.g., combining Aimovig with another preventive like beta-blockers or Botox).- **Hormonal links** (PCOS can worsen migraines; metformin might help stabilize hormones).2. **Vestibular Migraine vs. Epilepsy**- Your dizziness, \u201cfalling\u201d sensations, and vertigo might align with **vestibular migraine** (common in migraineurs) rather than microseizures. These often coexist with anxiety/depersonalization.- **Microseizures** (if EEG-confirmed) could explain episodic symptoms, but consider a second opinion if diagnosis is unclear.3. **Medication Interactions**- **Bupropion** can lower the seizure threshold and worsen anxiety/vertigo in some.- **Venlafaxine** (SNRI) and **topiramate** (can cause cognitive side effects) may need dosing adjustments.- Discuss a **medication review** with your neurologist/psychiatrist to rule out interactions or side effects driving symptoms.4. **Vascular or Autoimmune Causes**- The MRA could reveal blood vessel irregularities (e.g., vasculitis, stenosis). If normal, ask about:- **Intracranial hypertension** (via lumbar puncture for pressure checks).- **Autoimmune panels** (e.g., lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome) if inflammation is suspected.---### **Next Steps to Discuss with Your Care Team**- **Neurology Follow-Up**- Request a **vestibular assessment** (ENG/VNG testing) for dizziness.- Consider **long-term EEG monitoring** to confirm microseizures.- Explore **occipital nerve blocks** or IV infusions (e.g., magnesium/ketamine) for migraine relief.- **Hormonal Management**- PCOS-related hormonal fluctuations can trigger migraines. Ask about hormonal therapies (e.g., progesterone-only options) if appropriate.- **Mental Health Support**- Chronic pain/anxiety/BPD can amplify physical symptoms. Therapy (e.g., DBT for BPD) or mindfulness may help depersonalization.---### **Lifestyle Adjustments to Consider**- **Triggers**: Track diet (caffeine, processed foods), sleep, stress, and smoking (nicotine can worsen migraines).- **Vestibular rehab**: Physical therapy for vertigo/dizziness.- **Supplements**: Riboflavin (B2), coenzyme Q10, or melatonin (evidence-supported for migraines).---### **When to Seek Urgent Care**- If the migraine suddenly worsens with fever, confusion, neck stiffness, or vision loss, rule out meningitis/stroke.- Severe vertigo with vomiting/hearing loss could indicate Meniere\u2019s disease or labyrinthitis.---### **Support & Community**- **Migraine communities** (e.g., Migraine Buddy app, r/migraine on Reddit) share coping strategies.- **Therapy groups** for chronic illness/BPD can provide emotional support.Your persistence in advocating for answers is crucial. Keep pushing for a multidisciplinary approach (neurology, psychiatry, endocrinology) to address all angles. Wishing you relief soon. \ud83d\udc9c"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to have concerns about epilepsy recurrence, especially after a long seizure-free period. Here's a summary of key points to consider:### 1. **Likelihood of Recurrence**- **Early-Onset Seizures**: If your seizures in infancy were due to a specific trigger (e.g., fever or a transient issue), and you\u2019ve remained seizure-free for over a decade off medication, the risk of recurrence is generally **lower**. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes (e.g., benign infantile epilepsy) often resolve completely.- **Relapse Statistics**: Most recurrences happen within 1\u20132 years after stopping medication. After 10+ years without seizures, the risk decreases significantly, though not entirely eliminated.### 2. **Potential Triggers**While the cause of your initial seizure matters, common triggers for epilepsy recurrence in general include:- **Sleep deprivation** (a major factor for many people).- **Stress or anxiety**.- **Hormonal changes** (e.g., puberty, menstrual cycles).- **Substance use** (alcohol, drugs, or certain medications).- **Head injuries** or infections affecting the brain.- **Genetic or structural brain abnormalities** (if present initially).### 3. **Adolescence-Specific Factors**- Hormonal shifts during puberty can sometimes lower seizure thresholds.- Lifestyle changes (e.g., irregular sleep, stress from school, experimentation with substances) might increase risk.### 4. **What You Can Do**- **Consult a neurologist**: They can review your medical history, possibly recommend an EEG or imaging if needed, and provide personalized guidance.- **Monitor for symptoms**: Report any unusual events (e.g., staring spells, confusion, muscle jerks, or sensory changes) to a doctor.- **Lifestyle precautions**: Prioritize sleep, manage stress, avoid recreational drugs/alcohol, and protect against head injuries.### 5. **Key Takeaway**While recurrence is possible, your prolonged seizure-free period (10+ years off medication) suggests a **favorable prognosis**. However, individual risks depend on the original cause of your seizures and other factors. A neurologist can offer the most accurate assessment.Always seek professional medical advice for concerns specific to your health history."

        "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The episodes your niece is experiencing, particularly while eating ice cream, are concerning but may have a non-epileptic explanation. Here's a structured analysis of potential causes and recommendations:### **Key Observations:**- **Triggers:** Ice cream (cold, sweet), past fainting after a physical collision.- **Symptoms:** Headache, stiffness, brief apnea (not breathing), convulsions, rapid recovery, normal EEG.- **Context:** No family history of seizures; episodes are situational.### **Possible Causes:**1. **Vasovagal Syncope with Convulsive Activity:**- **Mechanism:** Brain freeze (cold-induced pain) triggers a vasovagal response, causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. This can lead to fainting and brief convulsive movements (\"convulsive syncope\").- **Why with Ice Cream?** Rapid consumption of cold food may stimulate the vagus nerve via the pharynx, exacerbating this reflex.2. **Reflex Anoxic Seizures (RAS):**- **Triggered by Pain:** Sudden pain (e.g., brain freeze or past collision) can cause a transient cessation of heart activity (vagally mediated asystole), leading to oxygen deprivation and stiffening/jerking.- **Distinction from Epilepsy:** EEG normality supports this being a non-epileptic event.3. **Breath-Holding Spells:**- **Possible Link:** Though typically triggered by emotional distress, pain (e.g., brain freeze) might provoke breath-holding, leading to syncope and postural stiffening.4. **Cardiac Arrhythmias:**- **Less Likely but Possible:** Conditions like Long QT syndrome can cause syncope triggered by cold or stress. However, this would require cardiac evaluation (e.g., EKG, Holter monitor).5. **Allergy/Intolerance:**- **Unlikely:** Anaphylaxis usually involves additional symptoms (e.g., hives, swelling). Dairy intolerance typically causes gastrointestinal issues, not syncope.### **Next Steps:**- **Medical Evaluation:**- **Cardiology Workup:** Rule out arrhythmias with an EKG or event monitor.- **Tilt Table Test:** Assess for vasovagal syncope predisposition.- **Pediatric Neurologist Consultation:** Differentiate between syncope with convulsions and epilepsy.- **Preventive Measures:**- **Slow Eating:** Encourage small bites of ice cream to minimize brain freeze.- **Avoid Triggers:** Temporarily avoid extremely cold foods while monitoring.- **Trigger Diary:** Log details of episodes (timing, food intake, activity).### **Reassurance:**- The normal EEG is reassuring for ruling out epilepsy. Syncope with convulsive movements is more common in children than true seizures and often resolves with age.### **Conclusion:**The episodes are likely vasovagal or reflex anoxic events triggered by brain freeze. Further specialized testing can clarify the cause. Encourage your sister to seek follow-up with a pediatric neurologist or cardiologist to ensure comprehensive evaluation. Reassure her that non-epileptic syncope, while alarming, is often manageable with lifestyle adjustments."

Rare hypersensitivity reactions to lamotrigine (e.g., drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/DRESS) should be ruled out if fever/rash develop.### 2. **Urgent Red Flags:**Seek immediate care if you experience:- Fever, chills, or night sweats.- Severe pain/redness near the lymph node or ear.- Sudden/profound hearing loss.- Neurological changes (e.g., confusion, seizures).### 3. **Next Steps:**- **Medical Evaluation:**- **Physical Exam:** A doctor should assess the lymph node (size, tenderness, mobility), ears (for infection/blockage), and throat/sinuses.- **Tests:** CBC, inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR), throat culture, or imaging (e.g., ultrasound of the lymph node, CT of sinuses/ears if needed).- **ENT Referral:** For hearing loss/ear blockage to rule out Meniere\u2019s, sensorineural causes, or chronic otitis.- **Medication Review:** Discuss with your psychiatrist/neurologist to rule out drug interactions or rare side effects.### 4. **Symptom Management:**- **Sleep/Appetite:** Short-term strategies like hydration, bland foods, and sleep hygiene. Avoid caffeine/screen time before bed.- **Mental Health:** Stress from physical symptoms can worsen depression; notify your mental health provider for support.### 5. **Long-Term Considerations:**- Monitor lymph node persistence (>2 weeks) for possible biopsy.- Address chronic ear/sinus issues if recurrent.**Action Plan:** Contact your primary care provider or visit an urgent care clinic promptly. If symptoms escalate (e.g., fever, severe pain), go to the ER. Keep your neurologist/psychiatrist informed to ensure coordinated care."

        "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your episodes of lightheadedness and syncope after workouts, particularly pull-ups, are intriguing and likely multifactorial. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Vagus Nerve Irritation (Neurocardiogenic Syncope):**- **Mechanical Trigger:** Pull-ups increase intra-abdominal pressure, which may compress the vagus nerve via your hiatal hernia. This could trigger a vasovagal response (sudden drop in heart rate/blood pressure), leading to syncope.- **Valsalva Maneuver:** Breath-holding during heavy lifting exacerbates this effect, stimulating the vagus nerve and reducing cardiac output.2. **PPI-Related Nutrient Deficiencies:**- Long-term PPI use can impair absorption of **magnesium, B12, calcium, and iron**, potentially contributing to dizziness or arrhythmias. Deficiencies in magnesium/B12 are notable for neurological/cardiovascular symptoms.3. **Exercise-Induced Syncope Mechanisms:**- **Post-Exercise Hypotension:** Blood pooling in extremities after stopping exercise.- **Orthostatic Intolerance:** Sudden posture changes post-exercise (less likely if episodes occurred immediately after pull-ups).### **Recommendations:**1. **Medical Evaluation:**- **Nutrient Levels:** Check serum magnesium, B12, ferritin, and calcium. Supplement if deficient.- **Cardiac/GI Imaging:** Consider a **tilt table test** for neurocardiogenic syncope or imaging (e.g., barium swallow) to assess hernia-vagus nerve anatomy.- **PPI Review:** Discuss with a gastroenterologist whether PPIs can be tapered or alternatives (e.g., H2 blockers, lifestyle modifications) explored.2. **Exercise Modification:**- **Gradual Reintroduction of Pull-Ups:** Attempt with strict attention to breathing (avoid Valsalva\u2014exhale during exertion). Use a spotter initially.- **Core Strengthening:** Engage in low-pressure core exercises (e.g., planks) to stabilize the diaphragm without straining the hernia.- **Hydration/Electrolytes:** Ensure adequate hydration and electrolyte balance (especially magnesium/potassium) during workouts.3. **Lifestyle Adjustments:**- **Posture/Technique:** Avoid heavy lifting immediately after meals (reduces gastric pressure). Use proper form to minimize intra-abdominal strain.- **Monitor Symptoms:** Keep a log of workouts, diet, and symptoms to identify patterns.### **Long-Term Considerations:**- **Bone/Digestive Health:** PPIs may increase osteoporosis risk; ensure adequate vitamin D/calcium intake and periodic DEXA scans.- **Neurological Follow-Up:** If symptoms recur, consider autonomic nervous system testing (e.g., heart rate variability during exercise).### **Conclusion:**Your hypothesis about vagus nerve irritation from the hiatal hernia during pull-ups is plausible. A combination of mechanical triggers and potential nutrient deficiencies likely contributed. With cautious exercise reintroduction, targeted medical testing, and nutrient monitoring, you may safely resume modified strength training. Collaborate closely with a cardiologist and GI specialist to tailor this approach."

        "question": "I wanted to share my experience with you to maybe get some more information about my situation.For 10 years, I have been experiencing every couple of months sudden deja vu like feeling followed by dissociation. I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The episodes you describe\u2014sudden deja vu followed by dissociation without loss of consciousness or motor symptoms\u2014warrant further investigation to differentiate between potential neurological and psychological causes. Here's a structured breakdown:### Key Considerations:1. **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (Focal Aware Seizures):**- **Why it fits:** Deja vu is a classic aura symptom of temporal lobe seizures. These seizures can manifest as brief, recurrent episodes with sensory/psychic phenomena (e.g., intense familiarity, dissociation) without motor features.- **Red flags:** Sudden onset, stereotyped episodes (similar each time), and lack of clear stress triggers.- **Next steps:** A neurologist may recommend an EEG (especially prolonged or sleep-deprived) to detect epileptiform activity. MRI could rule out structural abnormalities.2. **Anxiety/Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder:**- **Why it fits:** Dissociation can occur in anxiety disorders, even without overt stress. However, deja vu is less typical here.- **Caveats:** Episodes linked to anxiety might correlate with subtle triggers or subconscious stress. Panic attacks often include autonomic symptoms (e.g., palpitations), which you haven\u2019t mentioned.3. **Migraine Aura:**- **Why it might fit:** Some experience atypical auras (e.g., sensory disturbances) without headache (\u201csilent migraine\u201d). However, deja vu is less common here compared to seizures.### Recommendations:- **Consult a Neurologist:** Prioritize ruling out epilepsy. Share detailed episode descriptions (duration, triggers, associated symptoms like odd smells/tastes, fear, or automatisms).- **Diagnostic Tests:**- **EEG:** To detect abnormal brain activity, ideally during or shortly after an episode.- **MRI:** To exclude structural causes (e.g., hippocampal sclerosis).- **Symptom Tracking:** Document episodes (timing, context, symptoms) to identify patterns.- **Psychiatric Evaluation:** If neurological workup is negative, a neuropsychiatrist can explore anxiety-related dissociation or dissociative disorders.### Final Thoughts:While anxiety could contribute, the sudden, stereotypic nature of deja vu raises suspicion for focal seizures. Timely neurological assessment is crucial, as untreated epilepsy carries risks. Meanwhile, continue managing GAD with your current care team. Collaboration between neurology and psychiatry may yield the clearest diagnosis."

        "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",

        "answer": "The chronic nausea and vomiting experienced by both humans and the cat in the basement suite, which resolved immediately upon moving, strongly suggest an environmental toxin or hazard in the home. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most likely causes and recommended actions:### **Likely Causes:**1. **Mold (e.g., Stachybotrys/\"Black Mold\"):**- **Why?** Basements are prone to dampness and poor ventilation, fostering mold growth. Mold exposure can cause chronic nausea, vomiting, and respiratory issues. Both humans and pets (who may be more sensitive) would be affected.- **Evidence:** Symptoms ceased upon leaving, and the basement setting increases mold risk.2. **Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning:**- **Why?** CO is odorless/colorless and can cause nausea, fatigue, and vomiting. Low-level chronic exposure might explain the persistent symptoms. Pets are often affected first due to smaller size.- **Limitation:** Typically causes broader symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness), but should not be ruled out without testing.3. **Chemical Contaminants:**- **Examples:** VOCs (from paints, adhesives, or cleaning products), pesticides, or residual chemicals from prior tenants.- **Why?** Chronic exposure to toxins in air/water could affect all occupants. Cats, being closer to floors, might ingest or inhale more contaminants.4. **Radon Gas:**- **Why?** Basements are high-risk areas for radon accumulation. While primarily linked to lung cancer, prolonged low-level exposure may cause nonspecific symptoms like nausea (though less commonly).5. **Water Contamination:**- **Why?** Heavy metals (lead, arsenic) or bacteria in water could cause gastrointestinal distress. If the cat drank the same water, this fits.### **Recommended Actions:**- **Notify Current Owner/Residents:** Alert the landlord, real estate agent, and upstairs tenants about the issue. This is critical for their safety and legal responsibility.- **Environmental Testing:**- **Mold Inspection:** Hire a professional to test for mold, especially hidden growth in walls/ceilings.- **CO Detectors:** Ensure the home has functioning CO detectors (if not already installed).- **Radon Test:** Inexpensive kits can measure radon levels.- **Water Testing:** Check for heavy metals or pathogens if water was sourced from a well or old pipes.- **Air Quality Test:** For VOCs or other airborne chemicals.- **Medical Follow-Up:** Consider discussing these possibilities with healthcare providers to confirm linkage to symptoms.### **Conclusion:**The sudden resolution of symptoms across all three individuals points decisively to an environmental factor in the basement suite. Mold or CO are the top suspects, but thorough testing is needed. Your proactive steps to inform others and investigate the cause are commendable and could prevent future harm."

        "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\\\", white, myoclonus and \\\"brain zaps\\\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \\\"brain zaps\\\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \\\"brain zaps.\\\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your symptoms\u2014myoclonus (twitching) and brain zaps\u2014are concerning but likely not indicative of epilepsy. Here's a breakdown of the key points and recommendations:### **Likely Causes**1. **SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome**:- **Brain zaps** are a hallmark of abrupt SSRI withdrawal, especially with fluoxetine (despite its long half-life). If you stopped or missed doses around the time of substance use, this could explain the symptoms.- Improvement over two months aligns with gradual resolution of discontinuation effects.2. **Substance Interactions**:- Combining fluoxetine (serotonergic) with kratom (which has serotonergic/opioid effects) and alcohol/THC may have triggered **mild serotonin syndrome**. Symptoms like myoclonus can occur in mild cases, even without fever or severe agitation.- Alcohol and THC can lower the seizure threshold, but your twitching lacks classic seizure features (e.g., loss of consciousness, postictal state).3. **Caffeine and Fatigue**:- Exacerbation with coffee or tiredness is consistent with heightened nervous system sensitivity, not epilepsy.### **Why Epilepsy Is Unlikely**- Epilepsy typically involves recurrent, unprovoked seizures (not just myoclonus). Your twitching is situational, improving over time, and lacks features of generalized seizures (e.g., convulsions, confusion).- A single nocturnal seizure wouldn\u2019t cause persistent symptoms like brain zaps. Myoclonus can occur without epilepsy (e.g., stress, medication effects).### **Prognosis**- Symptoms will likely **continue to improve** gradually. Discontinuation syndrome and mild serotonin toxicity often resolve within weeks to months.- Brain zaps and myoclonus may persist but should diminish further if triggers (e.g., caffeine, stress) are minimized.### **Recommendations**1. **Medical Evaluation**:- Schedule a GP visit or consult a neurologist to rule out other causes (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, neurological injury). An EEG or MRI may be advised if seizures are suspected.- If fluoxetine was stopped abruptly, a supervised taper might help residual symptoms.2. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:- Avoid stimulants (caffeine, recreational drugs) and alcohol until symptoms resolve.- Prioritize sleep and stress management.3. **Monitor Symptoms**:- Seek urgent care if symptoms worsen (e.g., seizures, confusion, fever) or new neurological signs emerge.### **Takeaway**You\u2019re unlikely to have caused permanent damage or epilepsy. This appears to be a combination of SSRI discontinuation and substance interactions, which should resolve with time. However, medical confirmation is crucial for peace of mind and to exclude rare complications. Stay sober, avoid triggers, and prioritize follow-up care."

        "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your history and symptoms, here's a structured approach to address your concerns and potential solutions:### **1. Understanding the Likely Cause: Hemiparesis**- **Right Brain Surgery Impact**: The right brain controls the left side of the body. Surgery to remove an AVM may have damaged motor pathways, leading to **hemiparesis** (weakness on one side). Even mild damage can affect strength and coordination during demanding tasks like weightlifting, even if daily activities are unaffected.- **Why It Manifests During Lifting**: Resistance exercises require precise motor control and sustained muscle recruitment, which may overwhelm compromised neural pathways, causing trembling or fatigue.---### **2. Confirming the Diagnosis**- **Neurologist/Physiatrist Consultation**: Request a referral to a **physiatrist** (rehabilitation physician) or a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. They can:- Perform a detailed motor exam (e.g., spasticity, coordination).- Recommend imaging (e.g., MRI) to assess residual brain damage or scarring.- Rule out other causes (e.g., peripheral nerve injury, muscle atrophy).---### **3. Targeted Rehabilitation Strategies**#### **A. Physical Therapy (Neuro-Focused)**- **Progressive Resistance Training**: Start with very low weights (even <5 lbs) and slow, controlled movements to improve neuromuscular recruitment.- **Eccentric (Lowering Phase) Focus**: Emphasize the lengthening phase of lifts (e.g., slowly lowering a dumbbell), which is less neurologically demanding.- **Isometric Holds**: Static exercises (e.g., wall pushes, planks) to build stability without movement.- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Uses electrical currents to activate weakened muscles during exercises.#### **B. Adaptive Weightlifting Techniques**- **Unilateral Training**: Focus on single-arm exercises with your left arm first to avoid overcompensating with the right.- **Assisted Devices**: Use resistance bands or cable machines for smoother, adjustable resistance.- **Compensatory Strategies**: Modify grip (e.g., wrist straps) or body positioning to reduce shoulder strain.#### **C. Occupational Therapy (OT)**- OT can help adapt exercises to your neural capacity and improve functional strength for daily tasks.---### **4. Additional Interventions**- **Spasticity Management**: If stiffness is present, medications like baclofen or botulinum toxin injections may help.- **Neuroplasticity-Boosting Therapies**:- Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT): Restricts the stronger arm to force use of the weaker side.- Mirror Therapy: Uses visual feedback to \"trick\" the brain into improving motor control.---### **5. Realistic Expectations & Monitoring**- **Slow Progress**: Improvement may take months. Track small gains (e.g., increased reps or reduced trembling).- **Avoid Overtraining**: Fatigue can worsen weakness; prioritize quality over quantity.---### **6. Specialist Referrals**- **Rehabilitation Neurologist/Physiatrist**: For a tailored treatment plan.- **Neurophysical Therapist**: Find a PT experienced in post-stroke or brain injury rehab.---### **Key Takeaways**- Your symptoms align with **mild hemiparesis** from brain surgery. While it may limit high-demand activities, targeted rehab can improve function.- Specialized therapy and adaptive techniques are critical\u2014generic weightlifting programs won\u2019t address neurological deficits.- Advocate for a multidisciplinary approach (neurologist + physiatrist + PT) to optimize recovery.Let me know if you need help finding resources or crafting a specific exercise plan!"

        "answer": "The complex interplay of your symptoms suggests several potential connections and avenues for further exploration. Here's a structured approach to understanding and addressing your concerns:### 1. **Hormonal Fluctuations & Epilepsy (Catamenial Epilepsy)**- **Connection:** Your seizures aligning with your menstrual cycle point to **catamenial epilepsy**, where hormonal changes (e.g., estrogen surges during ovulation/progesterone drops before menstruation) lower the seizure threshold. Stopping birth control may have disrupted hormonal balance, triggering seizures.- **Next Steps:**- Consult a **neurologist specializing in epilepsy** to explore hormonal therapies (e.g., progesterone supplementation, adjusted birth control) or anti-seizure medications like **acetazolamide** for cyclical seizures.- Track seizures and menstrual cycles to identify patterns.### 2. **Ovarian Cysts & Hormonal Imbalances**- **Possible Conditions:**- **PCOS:** Linked to irregular cycles, cysts, and androgen excess, which may exacerbate hormonal seizure triggers.- **Endometriosis:** Severe menstrual pain but less directly tied to seizures.- **Next Steps:**- **Pelvic ultrasound** and hormonal testing (LH, FSH, testosterone, AMH) to evaluate for PCOS.- Consult a **gynecologist specializing in reproductive endocrinology** to consider birth control options that stabilize hormones (e.g., continuous cycling to suppress ovulation/cysts).### 3. **SVT & Seizures**- **Connection:**- Autonomic activation during seizures can trigger tachycardia, but SVT at 275 bpm suggests an independent arrhythmia.- Rarely, genetic **channelopathies** (e.g., ion channel mutations) could link epilepsy and cardiac issues.- **Next Steps:**- Proceed with **ablation** for SVT, as planned.- Discuss **cardiac genetic testing** with a cardiologist if there\u2019s a family history of arrhythmias/seizures or if SVT recurs post-ablation.### 4. **Multidisciplinary Care**- **Team Approach:** Collaborate with:- A **neurologist** (for epilepsy management).- A **gynecologist** (for hormonal/pelvic health).- A **cardiologist** (post-ablation follow-up).- Consider a **geneticist** if channelopathy is suspected.### 5. **Lifestyle & Monitoring**- **Hormonal Stability:** Reintroduce birth control (if safe with your neurologist) to suppress ovulation/cysts and stabilize hormones.- **Seizure/Heart Rate Logs:** Document episodes to identify triggers or correlations.### 6. **Potential Underlying Conditions**- **Genetic Syndromes:** While rare, conditions like **PCDH19 epilepsy** or **CHD2 mutations** can involve both seizures and autonomic dysfunction. Genetic testing may be warranted if standard treatments fail.### Final Thoughts:Your case highlights the importance of hormonal and autonomic interplay in epilepsy and cardiac health. Addressing hormonal stability (via tailored birth control or adjunct therapies) may reduce both ovarian and seizure issues, while the SVT ablation could resolve arrhythmias. A coordinated care plan is key to reclaiming your normal life. Advocate for referrals to specialists experienced in overlapping hormonal/neurological/cardiac conditions."

Type 1 diabetes may contribute to autonomic neuropathy, impairing blood pressure regulation.- **Cardiac Issues:** Arrhythmias or reduced cardiac output could transiently decrease oxygen delivery. A cardiology evaluation is prudent.- **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Diabetes can affect the autonomic nervous system, leading to poor circulation control.- **Blood Sugar Fluctuations:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) might mimic hypoxia symptoms. Check glucose during episodes, even if recent tests were normal.- **Screen-Related Factors:** Prolonged screen time might cause hyperventilation (altering CO2 levels) or eye strain, triggering vagal responses.**3. Concerns and Recommendations:**- **Frequency of Episodes:** Recurrent hypoxia, even mild, merits investigation to prevent cumulative effects. Document episodes (triggers, duration, symptoms) for specialists.- **Medical Evaluations:**- **Cardiology:** Assess for arrhythmias or structural issues.- **Neurology:** Explore non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or autonomic testing (e.g., tilt table).- **Endocrinology:** Ensure optimal diabetes management to avoid neuropathic complications.- **Immediate Steps:**- Rise slowly from sitting to minimize orthostatic stress.- Stay hydrated and maintain electrolyte balance.- Monitor blood sugar during episodes to rule out hypoglycemia.- Practice screen hygiene (take breaks, adjust posture).**4. Outlook and Follow-Up:**While not an emergency, frequent episodes require thorough evaluation to address underlying causes and prevent potential long-term effects. Your proactive approach\u2014specialist referrals and symptom tracking\u2014is crucial. Prioritize diabetes management and avoid delays in seeking follow-up care.**Conclusion:**Your symptoms are significant and warrant targeted medical investigation. While mild cerebral hypoxia isn\u2019t immediately life-threatening, recurrent episodes highlight the need for a comprehensive care plan. Stay vigilant with symptom tracking and adhere to upcoming specialist appointments to ensure optimal health outcomes."

        "question": "Currently on no medications, BW is normal other than some minor indication of anemia and malnourishment (low folate, hemotacrit, hemoglobin, vitamin d, sodium) high albumin.Family history of a wide variety of mental health conditions as well as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycistic kidneys.Began approximately 4 years ago. Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs. Also have had gastrointestinal issues which i\u2019m not sure if they are relevant or not: nausea and stomach pain after eating anything. Have had some issues with UTI\u2019s. All doctors I have visited have told me there is nothing wrong and make me feel as if they just believe i\u2019m looking for free pills(or a hypochrondiac) but I am still having these issues so i\u2019m not sure where to go from here. pls help",

        "answer": "The complex array of symptoms described suggests a multifactorial condition requiring a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. Below is a structured analysis and potential next steps:### **Key Considerations & Possible Diagnoses**1. **Neurological Concerns**- **Non-Epileptic Seizures**: Consider **psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)** or **convulsive syncope** (e.g., from dysautonomia). Normal EEG/MRI does not rule out all seizure types; video EEG during an episode may clarify.- **Photosensitivity**: Flashing lights triggering episodes could indicate **photosensitive epilepsy**, even with a normal baseline EEG. A **provocative EEG** with photic stimulation may help.- **Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disorders**: **Autoimmune encephalitis** (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor) or **demyelinating diseases** (e.g., MS variant). Consider lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (oligoclonal bands, autoantibodies).- **Movement Disorders**: Motor tics may suggest **Tourette\u2019s** (if childhood-onset) or **functional movement disorder**. A **movement disorder specialist** could clarify.2. **Nutritional Deficiencies**- **B12/Folate Deficiency**: Can cause neuropathy, cognitive issues, and anemia. Confirm levels and treat aggressively if deficient.- **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Linked to fatigue and muscle weakness. Supplementation may help.- **Electrolyte Imbalances**: Low sodium (hyponatremia) and high albumin (dehydration?) could contribute to neurological symptoms. Address hydration and recheck labs.3. **Cardiovascular/Autonomic Dysfunction**- **Dysautonomia/POTS**: Fainting spells and fatigue may align with **postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**. A **tilt-table test** could evaluate.- **Convulsive Syncope**: Jerking movements during fainting may mimic seizures. Rule out with cardiac monitoring.4. **Genetic/Metabolic Disorders**- **Mitochondrial Disease**: Symptoms like fatigue, seizures, and GI issues may warrant testing (e.g., serum lactate, genetic panels).- **Porphyria**: Rare but can cause neurovisceral attacks. Check urinary porphobilinogen during an episode.5. **Gastrointestinal & Immune Links**- **Celiac Disease/Malabsorption**: Chronic GI issues and nutrient deficiencies suggest possible **celiac** (check tissue transglutaminase IgA) or **IBD**.- **Autoimmune GI Disorders**: Explore **gastroparesis** or **mast cell activation syndrome** (linked to flushing, GI pain).6. **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)**- Consider if psychological stressors manifest physically. A **neuropsychiatrist** can assess while ruling out organic causes.### **Next Steps for Evaluation**1. **Neurology Reassessment**- **Video EEG Monitoring**: Capture an episode to distinguish epileptic vs. non-epileptic seizures.- **Repeat MRI with Contrast**: Assess for subtle white matter changes, inflammation, or demyelination.- **Autoimmune Panels**: Anti-NMDA, ANA, anti-thyroid antibodies, paraneoplastic panels.- **Lumbar Puncture**: Check for CSF inflammation, infections, or autoantibodies.2. **Cardiology/Dysautonomia Workup**- **Tilt-Table Test**: Evaluate for POTS or vasovagal syncope.- **Holter Monitor/Event Recorder**: Rule out arrhythmias during episodes.3. **Nutritional & Metabolic Testing**- **Full Iron Studies, B12, Folate**: Confirm deficiencies and treat.- **Mitochondrial Markers**: Serum lactate/pyruvate, amino acids, acylcarnitine profile.- **Electrolyte Rebalancing**: Address hyponatremia and dehydration.4. **Gastrointestinal Evaluation**- **Celiac Serology, Endoscopy**: Rule out malabsorption.- **GI Motility Studies**: Assess for gastroparesis.5. **Genetic Counseling**- Consider testing for **inherited disorders** (e.g., mitochondrial, porphyria) given family history.6. **Mental Health Support**- **Neuropsychiatric Evaluation**: Address possible FND, trauma, or comorbid anxiety/depression.### **Practical Recommendations**- **Symptom Diary**: Track episodes (triggers, duration, symptoms) to identify patterns.- **Tertiary Care Referral**: Seek a university hospital or specialist center for complex cases.- **Avoid Triggers**: Minimize substance use/flashing lights until evaluated.- **Advocate Persistently**: Stress the impact of symptoms on daily life to clinicians. Bring a support person to appointments.### **Closing Note**Your symptoms are valid and warrant thorough investigation. While the path to diagnosis may be challenging, a systematic approach addressing neurological, metabolic, autoimmune, and psychological factors is crucial. Prioritize correcting nutritional deficiencies and seek specialists who collaborate across disciplines. You may benefit from centers specializing in **neurological or rare diseases**. Stay persistent\u2014answers often emerge with time and targeted testing."

        "answer": "The episodes you describe\u2014transient loss of control on the left side, preserved consciousness, and triggers like standing quickly or stress\u2014suggest several potential conditions. Here\u2019s a structured approach to explore a diagnosis and solutions:### Possible Conditions to Consider:1. **Paroxysmal Dyskinesias (PKD):**- **Triggers:** Sudden movement (kinesigenic) or stress.- **Features:** Brief, involuntary movements (e.g., arm rising, facial scrunching) without loss of consciousness.- **Action:** A trial of anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine) may help, even without epilepsy.2. **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**- **Triggers:** Stress or psychological factors.- **Features:** Neurological symptoms without structural abnormalities. Requires exclusion of other causes.- **Action:** Multidisciplinary evaluation, including psychological support.3. **Focal Aware Seizures:**- **Features:** Brief, one-sided movements with awareness. EEG/MRI might miss deep-seated foci.- **Action:** Repeat EEG with video monitoring to capture an episode.4. **Cataplexy (Narcolepsy):**- **Triggers:** Strong emotions (e.g., nervousness).- **Features:** Sudden muscle weakness, but typically bilateral.- **Action:** Sleep study if daytime sleepiness or other narcolepsy symptoms exist.5. **Orthostatic Hypotension/Autonomic Dysfunction:**- **Triggers:** Standing quickly.- **Features:** Dizziness, but involuntary movements are atypical.- **Action:** Tilt-table test or blood pressure monitoring.### Recommended Steps:1. **Specialist Referral:**- Consult a neurologist specializing in **movement disorders** or **epilepsy** for a fresh evaluation.2. **Diagnostic Tests:**- **Repeat EEG with Video Monitoring:** To capture an episode, especially if previous tests were inconclusive.- **Tilt-Table Test:** Assess for autonomic dysfunction.- **MRI Update:** Rule out structural changes if not done recently.3. **Lifestyle & Symptom Tracking:**- **Diary:** Log triggers, duration, and symptoms to identify patterns.- **Hydration/Salt Intake:** Address orthostatic triggers if BP drops are suspected.4. **Psychological Support:**- Consider therapy to manage stress-related triggers or cope with undiagnosed symptoms.5. **Medication Trial:**- If PKD is suspected, discuss a low-dose trial of carbamazepine with a neurologist.### Advocacy & Emotional Health:- Persist in seeking answers; undiagnosed conditions often require persistence.- Join support groups (e.g., FND Hope, epilepsy forums) for shared experiences.### Final Note:Your symptoms are valid and deserve thorough investigation. A combination of specialized neurology input, targeted testing, and holistic support may help identify the cause and improve quality of life. Don\u2019t hesitate to seek a second opinion if progress stalls."

        "question": "[21M] epileptic from quemotherapy, and 5 years cancer free.Is there a variation that could allow me to safely take them? For instance \\\"lf you have X specific kind of epilepsy, or if you aren't taking X medication you can take them\\\" Does the dose matter? I have read people say that would have seizures when microdosing but not when doing high doses. How does that work? Thank you so much!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering the use of psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin, LSD) in your specific case, several critical factors must be weighed due to your history of chemotherapy-induced epilepsy and current cancer-free status. Below is a structured summary of key considerations:### **1. Epilepsy Type and Stability**- **Etiology**: Your epilepsy stems from chemotherapy, which may have caused structural brain changes. The stability of your condition (e.g., seizure-free duration, residual lesions on imaging) is crucial. Well-controlled epilepsy *might* lower immediate risk, but no guarantee of safety exists.- **Seizure Type**: Risks may differ between focal vs. generalized epilepsy. Focal seizures could theoretically pose lower systemic risk, but this is not well-studied for psychedelics.### **2. Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs)**- **Drug Interactions**:- **Enzyme-Inducing AEDs** (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) may accelerate psychedelic metabolism, altering their effects or requiring higher doses.- **Non-Enzyme-Inducing AEDs** (e.g., levetiracetam, valproate) pose fewer interaction risks but could still have unknown synergies with psychedelics.- **Efficacy**: Psychedelics might interfere with AED mechanisms, potentially lowering seizure thresholds.### **3. Dose Considerations**- **Microdosing vs. High Doses**:- Anecdotal reports of seizures with microdosing (but not high doses) are puzzling. Hypotheses include:- **Receptor Dynamics**: Microdoses may partially activate 5-HT2A receptors (pro-convulsant in some contexts), while high doses engage broader receptor networks (e.g., 5-HT1A, which may counteract seizures).- **Acute vs. Chronic Effects**: High doses may transiently modulate neural circuits, whereas repeated microdoses could sensitize pathways.- **Lack of Evidence**: No robust clinical data exists to confirm these mechanisms. Anecdotes should be interpreted cautiously.### **4. Medical Guidance**- **Consult a Neurologist**: Prioritize a discussion with a neurologist familiar with both epilepsy and psychedelic science. They can:- Review your seizure history, AED regimen, and neuroimaging.- Assess whether psychedelics could destabilize your condition.- **Risk-Benefit Analysis**: If seeking psychedelics for mental health (e.g., depression, PTSD), explore safer alternatives (e.g., therapy, FDA-approved medications) first.### **5. Key Takeaways**- **High Risk**: Psychedelics are not considered safe for individuals with epilepsy due to potential pro-convulsant effects.- **No Clear Exceptions**: Even with specific epilepsy types or AED regimens, risks remain poorly understood.- **Dose Uncertainty**: The relationship between dose and seizure risk is anecdotal and biologically plausible but unproven.### **Final Recommendation**Avoid psychedelics without explicit approval from a healthcare team. If pursuing this path, do so only in a medically supervised research setting. Your safety is paramount, and the stakes of triggering a seizure\u2014especially with a history of chemotherapy-related brain changes\u2014are significant. Always prioritize professional medical advice over anecdotal reports.*Note: This response synthesizes current scientific understanding and acknowledges gaps in research. Individual circumstances vary widely, and caution is essential.*"

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear you're struggling with these challenges. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and frustration, and it's great that you're seeking help and exploring solutions. Here's some guidance on how to approach your situation:1. ADHD-Like Symptoms and EpilepsyADHD and Epilepsy Connection: ADHD-like symptoms (e.g., difficulty focusing, procrastination, and distractibility) can sometimes overlap with epilepsy or be exacerbated by it. Epilepsy itself, or the medications used to treat it (like lamotrigine), can sometimes affect cognitive function, attention, and mood. It's worth discussing these symptoms with your neurologist or a psychiatrist to explore whether they could be related to your epilepsy, medication, or a separate condition like ADHD.Evaluation for ADHD: If you suspect ADHD, a formal evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist is the best way to determine if this is the case. While your counselor doesn't think you have ADHD, only a specialist can confirm this. If cost is a concern, ask about sliding-scale fees, university health services, or community mental health programs that might offer affordable evaluations.2. Lamotrigine and Cognitive EffectsMedication Side Effects: Lamotrigine is generally well-tolerated, but some people report cognitive side effects like brain fog, difficulty concentrating, or memory issues. If you suspect your medication might be contributing to your symptoms, talk to your neurologist. They might adjust your dosage or explore alternative medications.Don't Stop or Adjust Medication on Your Own: Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your epilepsy treatment.3. Strategies for Managing Attention and ProcrastinationWhile you explore the possibility of ADHD or other underlying causes, here are some practical strategies to help manage your symptoms:Break Tasks into Smaller Steps: Large tasks can feel overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable chunks and set mini-deadlines for each.Use a Timer (Pomodoro Technique): Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and reduce procrastination.Prioritize Tasks: Use a to-do list or app to prioritize tasks by importance and urgency. Focus on completing high-priority items first.Limit Distractions: Create a dedicated workspace, turn off notifications, and use apps like Freedom or StayFocusd to block distracting websites.Accountability Partner: Share your goals with a friend or classmate who can help keep you accountable.Reward Yourself: Set up a reward system for completing tasks (e.g., treat yourself to something you enjoy after finishing an assignment).4. Academic SupportUniversity Resources: Many universities offer academic support services, such as tutoring, study skills workshops, or time management coaching. Take advantage of these resources to improve your GPA and meet your conditional offer requirements.Disability Services: If you are diagnosed with ADHD or another condition, your university's disability services office may be able to provide accommodations (e.g., extended deadlines, note-taking assistance, or extra exam time).5. Mental Health SupportCounseling: Continue working with your college counselor or seek therapy to address stress, anxiety, and procrastination. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful for ADHD-like symptoms and time management.Stress Management: Practice mindfulness, meditation, or relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety and improve focus.6. Financial ConcernsAffordable Care Options: If cost is a barrier to seeing a specialist, look into community mental health clinics, university health services, or telehealth platforms that offer lower-cost consultations. Some specialists may also offer payment plans or sliding-scale fees based on income.7. Next StepsTalk to Your Neurologist: Schedule an appointment to discuss your attention issues and whether they could be related to your epilepsy or medication.Seek a Specialist Evaluation: If your neurologist agrees, pursue an evaluation for ADHD or other cognitive concerns.Implement Practical Strategies: Start using the strategies above to manage your symptoms while you explore medical options.It's clear that you're motivated to improve your situation, which is a great first step. With the right support and strategies, you can overcome these challenges and work toward your goals. Don't hesitate to reach out to trusted professionals or support networks\u2014you don't have to figure this out alone."

Currently taking : Lamictal 400mg Fluoxetine 10mg Omeprazole 40mg Gabapentin 300mg 3x day as needed Vitamin D DX : Bipolar type 2 Social phobia (not sure exactly how my psych phrased it) Anxiety Abdominal epilepsy Acid reflux Tobacco (on/off), marijuana use, almost never drink or use any other drugs. I will do my best to be brief. I have had serious mental health issues since I was a child. First suicide attempt was at 7. Institutionalized at 15 for suicidal ideation, and have had therapy since then. I restarted medications at 21. I have had a lot of bad experiences with medical professionals. Very abusive docs when institutionalized. My last doctor told me to treat my bipolar disorder with a multivitamin. The doctor before prescribed me an anti depressant, had a manic episode, then changed to lamictal 100mg. He also called me a drug seeker because I wanted muscle relaxers to treat a weird medical episode that was causing severe neck pain. This turned out to be abdominal epilepsy. I have used urgent cares on rare occasion to get antibiotics, etc. But I haven't had a pcp since I was 20. How can I find a PCP that is comfortable working with mental health patients? What do I need to have done to get on track? I am aware that I am extremely high risk for suicide, between bipolar, loss of a sibling to suicide, childhood sexual abuse. I feel it's more important than ever to get a grip on my physical health so I can have a long life with my wife and my parents, and live to take care of them in their golden years. Currently see a therapist and a psych for med management. I'm also working with my therapist now to work through my problems with seeking medical care. Any other questions I am happy to ask.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "First, I want to acknowledge how much you've been through and how proactive you're being in seeking care for both your mental and physical health. That takes a lot of courage, especially given your past experiences with medical professionals. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re committed to building a healthier future for yourself and your loved ones, which is incredibly admirable.Here are some steps and suggestions to help you find a primary care physician (PCP) who is comfortable working with mental health patients and to get on track with your overall health:Finding a PCP Who Understands Mental HealthAsk for Referrals:Your therapist or psychiatrist may be able to recommend a PCP who has experience working with patients with complex mental health histories. They often have professional networks and can point you to someone who is compassionate and knowledgeable.If you have friends or family members who also manage mental health conditions, ask if they have a PCP they trust.Look for a Patient-Centered PCP:Seek out PCPs who emphasize holistic care or have a background in integrative medicine. These providers are often more comfortable addressing both physical and mental health concerns.Check online profiles or clinic websites for mentions of mental health, chronic conditions, or a patient-centered approach.Consider Larger Health Systems:Larger medical groups or hospital systems often have more resources and may employ PCPs who are accustomed to working with patients who have complex needs, including mental health conditions.Interview Potential PCPs:When you find a potential PCP, consider scheduling a meet-and-greet appointment (many offices offer these) to ask about their experience with mental health patients.You can ask questions like:Do you have experience working with patients who have bipolar disorder and anxiety?How do you approach care for patients with complex medical and mental health needs?Are you comfortable coordinating care with my psychiatrist and therapist?Look for Trauma-Informed Care:Given your history of childhood trauma and negative experiences with medical professionals, a trauma-informed PCP may be a better fit. Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety, trust, and collaboration.What to Have Done to Get on TrackComprehensive Physical Exam:Since you haven\u2019t had a PCP in over a decade, a full physical exam is a good starting point. This should include:Blood pressure, heart rate, and weight.Blood work (e.g., cholesterol, blood sugar, liver function, kidney function, thyroid levels, and vitamin levels like B12 and folate, which can impact mood and energy).Review of your current medications and supplements to check for interactions or side effects.Epilepsy and Neurological Care:Make sure your PCP is aware of your abdominal epilepsy diagnosis and can coordinate with a neurologist if needed. Regular follow-ups for this condition are important.Mental Health Monitoring:Your PCP should be aware of your bipolar disorder, anxiety, and social phobia. They can help monitor for physical health issues that may be exacerbated by your mental health or medications (e.g., weight gain, metabolic issues, or vitamin deficiencies).Substance Use Discussion:Be open with your PCP about your tobacco and marijuana use. They can provide resources or support for reducing or quitting if that\u2019s a goal for you.Preventive Care:Catch up on age-appropriate screenings (e.g., cholesterol, diabetes, colon cancer screening if indicated).Discuss vaccinations (e.g., flu, COVID-19, pneumococcal).Gastrointestinal Health:Since you have acid reflux and are on omeprazole, your PCP may want to monitor for long-term side effects of proton pump inhibitors (e.g., bone density issues, vitamin B12 deficiency) and ensure your reflux is well-managed.Additional TipsBring a Summary of Your Health History:Write down a concise summary of your diagnoses, medications, and key medical history to share with your new PCP. This will help them get up to speed quickly.Advocate for Yourself:If you feel dismissed or unheard, it\u2019s okay to seek a different provider. You deserve compassionate, respectful care.Consider a Care Manager:Some insurance plans offer care managers who can help coordinate your care between your PCP, psychiatrist, and therapist.Address Trauma in Therapy:Continue working with your therapist on your past trauma and medical-related anxiety. This can help you feel more empowered in seeking and receiving care.Questions to Ask Your PCP at Your First VisitHow can we work together to manage my physical health alongside my mental health conditions?Are there any lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, sleep) that could help improve my overall health?Should I be concerned about any long-term side effects of my current medications?How often should I schedule follow-up appointments to stay on top of my health?Final ThoughtsYou\u2019re taking a huge step by prioritizing your health, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Building a trusting relationship with a PCP may take time, but it\u2019s worth the effort. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this journey\u2014your therapist, psychiatrist, and loved ones are all part of your support system. Keep advocating for yourself, and don\u2019t hesitate to lean on your support network when needed.If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. You\u2019ve got this!"

Dr showed him that the levels dropped to dangerous levels in three years despite an increase in meds in those years. Any insight in what this could be? He's waiting on more blood tests.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like your boyfriend\u2019s medication levels (specifically for his anti-epileptic drugs, or AEDs) have dropped significantly over the past three years, despite increasing his dosage. This is concerning because maintaining therapeutic levels of these medications is critical for preventing seizures, especially in someone with a history of epilepsy. Here are some possible reasons for the drop in medication levels:1. Metabolic ChangesLiver Enzyme Induction: Phenobarbital is a potent inducer of liver enzymes (CYP450 system), which can increase the metabolism of other medications, including lamotrigine (Lamictal). Over time, this could lead to lower blood levels of lamotrigine, even if the dose has been increased. This is a common issue with enzyme-inducing AEDs.Weight Changes: If your boyfriend\u2019s weight has fluctuated significantly, it could affect how his body distributes and metabolizes medications. At 220 lbs, his body may require higher doses to maintain therapeutic levels.2. Drug InteractionsMarijuana Use: While occasional marijuana use is unlikely to significantly impact AED levels, chronic use could potentially affect liver enzymes or drug metabolism. However, this is less well-studied and would depend on the frequency and amount of use.Vaping: Nicotine can also affect liver enzymes and drug metabolism, though its impact on AEDs like lamotrigine and phenobarbital is less clear.3. Medication AdherenceIf your boyfriend has been inconsistent with taking his medications, this could lead to lower blood levels. However, since his dose has been increased over time, this seems less likely unless he\u2019s been skipping doses more frequently.4. Absorption IssuesGastrointestinal issues (e.g., changes in gut health, absorption problems) could affect how well his body absorbs lamotrigine or phenobarbital. This is less common but worth considering if other factors don\u2019t explain the drop.5. Tolerance or Disease ProgressionIn some cases, the body can develop a tolerance to AEDs, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. Additionally, if his epilepsy has progressed or changed in some way, his current medication regimen might no longer be sufficient.6. Lab Variability or ErrorsWhile less likely, it\u2019s possible that there was an error in the blood test or lab analysis. Repeating the blood tests (as his doctor is doing) will help rule this out.Next Steps:Wait for Blood Tests: The additional blood tests will provide more clarity on his current medication levels, liver function, and other potential factors.Review Medication Regimen: His doctor may need to adjust his doses or consider switching medications if his current regimen isn\u2019t maintaining therapeutic levels.Monitor for Symptoms: Even though he hasn\u2019t had a seizure in three years, the drop in medication levels increases his risk. He should be vigilant for any warning signs of seizures (e.g., auras, mood changes, or other pre-seizure symptoms).Lifestyle Factors: His doctor may recommend reducing or eliminating vaping and marijuana use to see if it improves medication stability.It\u2019s great that he\u2019s following up with his doctor and getting this addressed. Maintaining therapeutic levels of his AEDs is crucial for his long-term health and seizure control. If his current medications aren\u2019t working as expected, his doctor might explore alternative treatments or combinations of AEDs."

The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \\\"diagnosed\\\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been. And every now and then I'm seeing things like a weird grey cloud with a face in my bedroom or I'll think my hands are turning grey when they aren't.",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a difficult time. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's important to address these concerns with your healthcare providers as soon as possible. Here are some steps you might consider:1. Immediate Concerns:Suicidal Thoughts: If you're feeling more suicidal than ever, this is an emergency. Please reach out to a crisis hotline, a trusted friend, or go to the nearest emergency room. In the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.Hallucinations: Seeing things like a grey cloud with a face or thinking your hands are turning grey could be a sign of something more serious, such as psychosis or a side effect of your medications. This needs immediate medical attention.2. Medication Review:Polypharmacy: You're on multiple medications, and sometimes the combination can lead to unexpected side effects or interactions. It's crucial to have a thorough review of all your medications with your psychiatrist or a pharmacist.Venlafaxine (Effexor): This is an SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) that can have significant withdrawal symptoms if not tapered properly. Make sure you're following your doctor's instructions closely.Oxcarbazepine: This is an anticonvulsant that's sometimes used for mood stabilization. It can have side effects like dizziness, fatigue, and changes in vision, which might be contributing to how you're feeling.3. Substance Interactions:Weed and Alcohol: Both can interact with your medications, especially psychiatric meds. Weed can exacerbate anxiety, paranoia, and even trigger psychotic episodes in some people. Alcohol can also interact negatively with your medications, worsening depression and anxiety.Past Experience: Your bad experience with weed might have triggered a lasting anxiety or even a mild form of PTSD. This could be contributing to your ongoing symptoms.4. Physical Symptoms:Muscle and Joint Pain: This could be a side effect of your medications, or it could be related to your mental health. Chronic stress and anxiety can manifest physically, causing muscle tension and pain.Fatigue: This could be due to depression, medication side effects, or even something like anemia or thyroid issues. It might be worth getting some blood tests done to rule out physical causes.5. Next Steps:Second Opinion: If your current psychiatrist isn't addressing your concerns adequately, it might be worth seeking a second opinion from another mental health professional.Therapy: In addition to medication, therapy (like CBT or DBT) can be incredibly helpful for managing anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.Support System: Lean on your support system\u2014friends, family, or support groups. You don't have to go through this alone.6. Document Your Symptoms:Keep a detailed journal of your symptoms, including when they occur, their severity, and any potential triggers. This can help your healthcare provider make more informed decisions about your treatment.7. Emergency Plan:If things get worse, have a plan in place. Know where the nearest emergency room is, and have someone you can call if you need immediate help.Please don't hesitate to seek help immediately if you feel like you're in crisis. Your safety and well-being are the most important things right now."

        "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \\\"wake up\\\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",

        "answer": "It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve already scheduled a doctor\u2019s appointment to discuss these symptoms, as a healthcare professional will be able to provide the most accurate assessment and guidance. That said, I can offer some general insights based on what you\u2019ve described.Your symptoms\u2014random tastes or smells, bursts of euphoria, dissociation, and the sleep-related experiences\u2014do share some similarities with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as you\u2019ve noted. TLE is a type of focal epilepsy that can cause sensory disturbances (like unusual smells or tastes), emotional changes (such as sudden euphoria or fear), and altered states of consciousness. These episodes are often brief and can be mistaken for other conditions, such as migraine auras or even psychological phenomena.The sleep-related symptoms you describe, particularly the dream-like state, buzzing sensations, and episodes resembling sleep paralysis, could also be related to seizure activity or other neurological conditions. For example:Hypnagogic or hypnopompic states: These are the transitional states between wakefulness and sleep, where vivid dreams, hallucinations, or paralysis can occur. While these can happen to anyone, they might be more pronounced in people with certain neurological conditions.Nocturnal seizures: Seizures that occur during sleep can sometimes cause unusual sensations, movements, or confusion upon waking.Sleep disorders: Conditions like narcolepsy or parasomnias could also explain some of your experiences, though they don\u2019t fully account for the sensory or emotional symptoms you\u2019ve described.The fact that you have a family history of epilepsy adds another layer of relevance, as epilepsy can have a genetic component. However, it\u2019s important to note that many of these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, such as migraines, anxiety disorders, or even stress-related dissociation.Key Points to Discuss with Your Doctor:Detailed Symptom History: Be prepared to describe the frequency, duration, and triggers of your symptoms. Keeping a symptom diary can be helpful.Family History: Share what you know about your family\u2019s history of epilepsy or other neurological conditions.Sleep Patterns: Discuss your sleep issues in detail, including the dream-like states, buzzing sensations, and episodes of feeling \u201clocked-in.\u201dMigraine History: Since you\u2019ve previously attributed some symptoms to migraine auras, clarify how these episodes differ or overlap.Diagnostic Steps Your Doctor Might Recommend:Neurological Exam: To assess your brain function and look for any signs of neurological abnormalities.EEG (Electroencephalogram): This test measures electrical activity in the brain and can help detect seizure activity, especially if performed during or immediately after an episode.MRI or CT Scan: Imaging studies can rule out structural abnormalities in the brain.Sleep Study (Polysomnography): If sleep disorders are suspected, this test can monitor your brain activity, breathing, and movements during sleep.Final Thoughts:While it\u2019s natural to feel concerned, try not to overthink things before your appointment. Many of the symptoms you\u2019ve described can have benign explanations, but it\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution and get a thorough evaluation. In the meantime, avoid self-diagnosing and focus on maintaining a healthy sleep schedule and stress management, as these can influence both neurological and psychological symptoms.Good luck with your appointment, and I hope you get some clarity and answers soon!"

        "question": "Male 31 non smoker 6\u20191\u201d 250lbs, no history of epilepsy/seizuresI have always had sensitivity to lights while driving, especially at night. Things such as normal car headlights and signals have not caused a problem, however when it\u2019s been raining or wet it causes the lights to be reflected off the pools of water it often disorients me and causes a dizzy feeling. I am in An area where it doesn\u2019t rain now and yesterday had to drive through a tunnel covered with a crazy amount of LED lights, and with them reflecting off the cars I became almost instantly overwhelmingly dizzy and nauseous and had to pull over for 15 minutes for it to stop. I am not sure what is causing it, but I am afraid to drive at night or in certain areas because of this issue.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your symptoms suggest a heightened sensitivity to light, which could be related to a condition known as photophobia (light sensitivity). While photophobia itself is not a disease, it can be a symptom of an underlying issue. Given your description, here are some possibilities to consider:1. Visual Stress or Eye StrainProlonged exposure to bright or flickering lights (like LED lights in the tunnel) can overstimulate your visual system, leading to dizziness, nausea, and disorientation.Reflective surfaces (e.g., wet roads, car surfaces) can exacerbate this by scattering light and creating glare.2. Migraine-Associated Light SensitivityEven if you don\u2019t experience headaches, light sensitivity can be a symptom of migraine aura or a precursor to migraines. This is sometimes called a \"silent migraine.\"The disorientation, dizziness, and nausea you describe are common migraine-related symptoms.3. Vestibular System IssuesYour symptoms could be related to your vestibular system, which helps control balance and spatial orientation. Bright, flashing, or reflective lights might disrupt this system, leading to dizziness and nausea.Conditions like vestibular migraines or visual vertigo could be contributing factors.4. Underlying Eye ConditionsConditions like astigmatism, cataracts, or dry eye syndrome can increase sensitivity to light and glare.Even if you haven\u2019t noticed other vision problems, an eye exam could help rule these out.5. Anxiety or Stress ResponseIf you\u2019ve had previous negative experiences with light sensitivity, your body might be reacting with a stress response (e.g., dizziness, nausea) when exposed to similar triggers.What You Can Do:See an Eye Doctor (Optometrist or Ophthalmologist):A comprehensive eye exam can rule out issues like astigmatism, cataracts, or other eye conditions.They can also assess your need for glasses with anti-glare coatings or specialized lenses for light sensitivity.Consider a Neurological Evaluation:If your symptoms are severe or worsening, a neurologist can evaluate for conditions like migraines, vestibular disorders, or other neurological issues.Try Anti-Glare Measures:Use polarized sunglasses during the day and anti-glare glasses at night to reduce the impact of bright or reflective lights.Ensure your car\u2019s windshield is clean and free of streaks, as these can worsen glare.Limit Exposure to Triggers:Avoid driving in conditions that trigger your symptoms (e.g., heavy rain, tunnels with intense lighting) when possible.If you must drive in these conditions, take frequent breaks and look away from direct or reflected light sources.Manage Stress and Anxiety:If anxiety about driving at night or in certain conditions is worsening your symptoms, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor.When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention:If your symptoms worsen or are accompanied by other neurological symptoms (e.g., confusion, loss of consciousness, severe headaches, or vision changes), seek medical attention promptly.Your symptoms are manageable, but it\u2019s important to identify the underlying cause to address them effectively. Start with an eye exam and go from there."

        "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Hello! I\u2019m really sorry to hear about the challenges you\u2019ve been facing with your epilepsy. It sounds like it\u2019s been a long and frustrating journey, and I can understand how disheartening it must feel to not have more answers or improvements over the years. Let\u2019s break this down and see if there are any steps or options that might help you moving forward.1. Current Treatment and MedicationYou\u2019re currently on lamotrigine, which is a common and effective medication for generalised epilepsy. However, if you\u2019re still having seizures once a month, it might suggest that your epilepsy isn\u2019t fully controlled.Ask your neurologist about adjusting your medication: Sometimes, tweaking the dosage or adding a second medication (adjunctive therapy) can help improve seizure control. Medications like levetiracetam, valproate, or brivaracetam are often used alongside lamotrigine.Medication levels: Have you had your lamotrigine blood levels checked recently? Ensuring you\u2019re at the optimal therapeutic dose is important.2. Seeking a Second OpinionIt might be worth seeking a second opinion from another neurologist, especially one who specialises in epilepsy (an epileptologist). They might offer a fresh perspective or suggest alternative treatments.In the UK, you can ask your GP for a referral to a different specialist or a tertiary epilepsy centre. The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, for example, is a leading centre for epilepsy care.3. Advanced Testing and InvestigationsSince the cause of your epilepsy is still unknown, it might be worth exploring further investigations:MRI scan: To check for any structural abnormalities in the brain.EEG monitoring: Prolonged EEGs (e.g., 24-48 hours) can help identify seizure patterns or triggers.Genetic testing: In some cases, genetic factors can contribute to epilepsy, and identifying these might help guide treatment.These tests could provide more clarity and potentially open up new treatment options.4. Lifestyle and TriggersAlcohol: You mentioned you drink. Alcohol can lower the seizure threshold, so reducing or avoiding it might help improve seizure control.Sleep: Poor sleep is a common seizure trigger. Aim for consistent, good-quality sleep.Stress: Stress and anxiety can also trigger seizures. Consider mindfulness, yoga, or therapy to manage stress.Diet: Some people with epilepsy find that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carb) helps reduce seizures. This is something you could discuss with your neurologist.5. Driving and IndependenceIn the UK, the driving rules for epilepsy are strict: you must be seizure-free for 12 months (or have seizures only during sleep) to be eligible for a license. This can feel incredibly limiting, but it\u2019s important for your safety and others\u2019.If your seizures are still monthly, it might be worth focusing on improving seizure control first. Once you achieve longer periods of seizure freedom, you can revisit the driving issue.6. Travel and WorkTravel: When travelling abroad, make sure you have travel insurance that covers pre-existing conditions like epilepsy. Carry a medical ID bracelet or card, and ensure you have enough medication for the trip.Work: If your seizures are affecting your work, consider discussing this with your employer. In the UK, employers are required to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010.7. Support and Mental HealthLiving with epilepsy can be emotionally challenging. It might help to connect with others who understand what you\u2019re going through. Organisations like Epilepsy Action or Epilepsy Society in the UK offer support groups, resources, and advice.If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, consider speaking to a counsellor or therapist who specialises in chronic conditions.8. Emerging TreatmentsIf traditional medications aren\u2019t fully controlling your seizures, there are other options to explore:Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS): A device implanted in your chest that sends electrical impulses to the brain to reduce seizures.Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): Similar to VNS but targets specific areas of the brain.Cannabidiol (CBD): In some cases, CBD oil has been shown to reduce seizures, particularly in treatment-resistant epilepsy.These treatments are typically considered when medications alone aren\u2019t effective, so discuss them with your neurologist.9. Advocating for YourselfIt\u2019s important to be proactive in your care. If you feel your neurologist isn\u2019t providing enough information or exploring new options, don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions or push for further investigations. You have the right to understand your condition and explore all available treatments.Final ThoughtsIt\u2019s tough living with epilepsy, especially when it feels like progress is slow. But there are still options to explore, from adjusting your treatment plan to seeking a second opinion or exploring advanced therapies. Keep advocating for yourself, and don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to support networks for help.If you\u2019d like, I can help you draft a list of questions to ask your neurologist or provide more information on any of the points above. Let me know how else I can assist! :)Take care, and I hope things improve for you soon."

        "question": "22F, 5\u20195, 173lb, whitehi there! weird thing happened last night and i\u2019m nervous and hoping someone might have some input for me. i recently started taking prozac (10mg) in conjunction with lamictal (125mg) (which i\u2019ve been on for about 6 weeks) for MDD. i\u2019ve had a huge decrease in appetite which has led to me forgetting to eat a lot. yesterday i ate very little - almost nothing, without realizing. i was smoking weed with my partner and i started to feel really unwell. i have a low tolerance so i didn\u2019t think much of it. i remember telling him i wanted to lay down, and next thing i knew i woke up to him holding me and saying my name over and over. he asked me a bunch of questions about my surroundings and personal information (address, birthday, etc.) to make sure i was aware and coherent. he said i was sitting there, mentioned i wanted to lay down, and then my body stiffened/seized up and i slid down the chair backwards until i was on the floor and he started trying to wake me up. he said in total, i was out for less than a minute, but he was worried i was having a seizure. while i was out, i was having what felt like a short lucid dream where i was rolling down a mountain, if that\u2019s important. when i came back to my senses, i was sweating a lot, and was nauseous. i laid on the floor for a little bit until i felt okay, and then went to bed. today i feel fine.i figured i just fainted bc i hadn\u2019t eaten and i was smoking, but i know serotonin syndrome can cause seizures so i\u2019m just feeling very anxious and wondering if i\u2019m worrying over nothing. i\u2019ve never fainted or had a seizure so i don\u2019t really know what either one feel like.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry you experienced that\u2014it sounds really unsettling! Based on what you've described, it does seem more likely that you fainted (vasovagal syncope) rather than had a seizure, but it's always good to be cautious and consult a healthcare professional to rule out anything serious. Here's a breakdown of the possibilities:1. Fainting (Syncope)Low blood sugar or dehydration: Not eating enough, especially combined with smoking weed (which can lower blood pressure and cause dizziness), could have led to a drop in blood pressure or blood sugar, causing you to faint.Symptoms: Fainting often involves a brief loss of consciousness, sweating, nausea, and feeling unwell beforehand. The \"stiffening\" your partner described could have been your body reacting to the stress of fainting.Recovery: People who faint typically wake up quickly (within seconds to a minute) and feel better shortly after, which aligns with your experience.2. SeizureSymptoms: Seizures often involve involuntary movements (like jerking), confusion after waking, and sometimes biting your tongue or losing bladder control. The \"lucid dream\" you described could be a postictal state (after a seizure), but this is less common.Duration: Seizures can vary in length, but they often leave people feeling disoriented or fatigued for a longer period afterward.Serotonin syndrome: While serotonin syndrome can cause seizures, it\u2019s rare at your current doses of Prozac and Lamictal. Serotonin syndrome usually involves other symptoms like agitation, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, muscle rigidity, and fever.3. Weed-Related ReactionWeed can cause dizziness, low blood pressure, and even fainting in some people, especially if you have a low tolerance or haven\u2019t eaten much. The combination of low food intake and smoking could have triggered this episode.What You Should Do:See a Doctor: Even if you feel fine now, it\u2019s important to rule out anything serious, like a seizure or an underlying medical condition. Your doctor may want to run tests (e.g., blood work, ECG, or even an EEG if they suspect a seizure).Monitor Your Symptoms: If this happens again, note any triggers (e.g., fasting, smoking, stress) and describe the episode in detail to your doctor.Stay Hydrated and Eat Regularly: Since you\u2019ve noticed a decreased appetite, try to set reminders to eat small, balanced meals throughout the day to avoid low blood sugar or dehydration.Be Cautious with Weed: If you continue smoking, consider doing so in a safe environment (e.g., sitting or lying down) and avoid it if you haven\u2019t eaten enough.When to Seek Immediate Help:If you experience another episode of loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, or unusual movements.If you develop symptoms of serotonin syndrome (e.g., high fever, rapid heart rate, muscle stiffness, confusion).If you feel persistently unwell or notice any new or worsening symptoms.It\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about your health! While this episode might just be a one-time thing related to low food intake and weed, it\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution and get checked out. Let your prescribing doctor know about this incident, as they may want to adjust your medications or investigate further. Take care!"

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about everything you've been going through. Managing epilepsy, especially when it involves different types of seizures and medications, can be incredibly challenging and frustrating. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I can understand why you're feeling overwhelmed. While I can't provide medical advice, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help you navigate this situation.1. Inconsistent Medication ManagementIt seems like there have been several changes in your medication regimen, and the transitions between medications (e.g., Keppra to Lamotrigine) were not well-managed. Abrupt changes or inadequate dosing can trigger seizures, especially in someone with a history of epilepsy.The fact that you were prescribed only 25mg of Lamotrigine initially, after being on higher doses of Keppra, might have been insufficient to control your seizures. Lamotrigine typically needs to be titrated up slowly to avoid side effects, but starting at such a low dose may have left you vulnerable to breakthrough seizures.2. Myoclonic Seizures and SleepMyoclonic seizures are often triggered by sleep deprivation or irregular sleep patterns, which seems to align with your experience. The episode in September, where you had only 2 hours of sleep, likely contributed to the cascade of seizures.Myoclonic seizures can be tricky to manage because they are often less dramatic than tonic-clonic seizures, but they are still a sign of ongoing epileptic activity. It\u2019s concerning that your previous neurologists didn\u2019t recognize or address these as seizures, especially since they can escalate into more severe episodes.3. Medication Adjustments and Side EffectsCombining Lamotrigine and Keppra is not uncommon, but finding the right balance can be difficult. Both medications have different mechanisms of action, and their side effects can sometimes exacerbate each other or cause new issues.Clobazam is often used as a rescue medication for breakthrough seizures, but relying on it regularly might indicate that your baseline medication regimen isn\u2019t fully controlling your seizures.4. Possible TriggersSleep deprivation, stress, and hormonal changes (especially in someone your age) can all lower the seizure threshold. If you\u2019ve been under more stress or experiencing changes in your sleep patterns, this could be contributing to the increase in seizures.It\u2019s also worth considering whether any lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, alcohol, caffeine, or other medications) might be playing a role.5. Next StepsSeek a Second Opinion: It might be helpful to consult with a different neurologist, ideally one who specializes in epilepsy. They can review your history, medication regimen, and seizure patterns to determine if there\u2019s a better treatment plan for you.Medication Review: Your current combination of Lamotrigine and Keppra might need adjustment. A neurologist might consider increasing the Lamotrigine dose (since it\u2019s still relatively low) or exploring other medications like Valproate, which is often effective for myoclonic seizures.Sleep Hygiene: Since sleep seems to be a major trigger, focusing on improving your sleep quality and consistency could help reduce seizures. This might involve establishing a strict sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bed, or even discussing sleep aids with your doctor.Seizure Diary: Keeping a detailed record of your seizures, including triggers, timing, and severity, can help your neurologist identify patterns and adjust your treatment more effectively.Emergency Plan: Make sure you have a clear plan in place for what to do if you experience a cluster of myoclonic seizures or feel a major seizure coming on. This might include having rescue medications like Clobazam on hand and knowing when to seek emergency care.6. Mental Health SupportDealing with uncontrolled seizures and the fear of having another major episode can take a toll on your mental health. It\u2019s important to seek support, whether through therapy, support groups, or talking to friends and family. You\u2019re not alone, and there are resources available to help you cope.7. Advocate for YourselfIt\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been through a lot, and it\u2019s important to advocate for your own care. If you feel like your concerns aren\u2019t being taken seriously, don\u2019t hesitate to push for further testing, adjustments, or referrals to specialists.I hope this helps provide some clarity and direction. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team or seek additional support. You deserve to feel safe and in control of your health."

        "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \\\"out\\\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your experience, but I'm glad you're getting the care you need and that you have a supportive environment around you. Let me address your questions:1. How common is this type of thing?Seizures can happen to people without a history of epilepsy, and they can be caused by a variety of factors. While epilepsy is a common cause, other potential triggers include:Medications: Wellbutrin (bupropion), which you mentioned you're taking, is known to lower the seizure threshold, especially at higher doses or in people with certain risk factors.Dehydration or electrolyte imbalances: Being at the beach in the heat could have contributed to this.Sleep deprivation or stress: These can sometimes trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.Underlying medical conditions: While your tests so far are normal, further testing (like the MRI) may provide more insight.Acute illness or infection: Sometimes, infections or fevers can trigger seizures.Unknown causes: In some cases, a seizure may occur without a clear cause, and it might never happen again.It's not uncommon for someone to have a single seizure without a clear underlying cause. If this is your first seizure and no cause is found, it doesn't necessarily mean you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is typically diagnosed after someone has had two or more unprovoked seizures.2. Should you wait before returning to hobbies like dancing or sewing?It's wise to be cautious, especially since you're still recovering and awaiting further tests. Here are some considerations:Dancing: If dancing involves vigorous physical activity or being in an environment where a fall could be dangerous (e.g., on a hard surface), it might be best to wait until you've had further evaluation and clearance from your neurologist. If it's low-impact and in a safe environment, you might be able to resume sooner, but listen to your body and avoid overexertion.Sewing: Using a sewing machine involves fine motor skills and focus. If you're still experiencing tremors or fatigue, it might be safer to wait until you feel more stable. Additionally, if you were to have another seizure while using sharp tools or machinery, it could be risky.General advice:Follow up with your neurologist: Be sure to mention the seizure during your upcoming appointment, as they may want to adjust your treatment plan or investigate further.Avoid triggers: Stay hydrated, get enough sleep, and avoid excessive stress or overexertion.Safety first: Until you have more clarity about what caused the seizure, avoid activities that could put you at risk if another seizure were to occur (e.g., swimming alone, driving, or operating heavy machinery).Keep a seizure diary: If you experience any unusual symptoms or another episode, document the details (time, symptoms, potential triggers) to share with your doctor.It's great that you're being proactive about your health and taking precautions. Hopefully, the MRI and neurologist appointment will provide more clarity. In the meantime, take it easy and prioritize your safety and recovery."

        "question": "Hello, I am 24 and I was diagnosed with epilepsy around 2 years ago, and prior to this I thought epilepsy was 1) you were born with it, and 2) it was caused due to flashing lights. My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had. I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I'm glad you're seeking more information. Epilepsy is a complex condition, and there are many misconceptions about it, so let\u2019s clarify some things and provide some insight into your situation.1. Epilepsy Isn\u2019t Always Something You\u2019re Born WithWhile some people are born with epilepsy (due to genetic factors or brain abnormalities present at birth), many develop it later in life. Epilepsy can be caused by a variety of factors, including:Brain injuries (e.g., from trauma, stroke, or infection)Genetic predisposition (even if it doesn\u2019t show up until later in life)Structural changes in the brain (e.g., tumors, scars, or developmental issues)Unknown causes (this is called idiopathic epilepsy)In your case, since your epilepsy started in your early 20s without an obvious cause, it might fall under the category of idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy (meaning the cause is unknown).2. Flashing Lights Are Just One Potential TriggerPhotosensitive epilepsy (seizures triggered by flashing lights) is actually quite rare, affecting only about 3-5% of people with epilepsy. Most people with epilepsy, like you, don\u2019t have seizures triggered by lights. Seizures can be triggered by a wide range of factors, or sometimes no obvious trigger at all. Common triggers include:Stress (physical or emotional)Lack of sleepHormonal changesIllness or feverAlcohol or drug useMissed medicationHowever, in many cases, seizures seem to occur randomly, without any identifiable trigger. This can be frustrating, but it\u2019s not uncommon.3. Your Type of EpilepsySince your seizures don\u2019t have an obvious trigger and aren\u2019t related to flashing lights, you might have what\u2019s called generalized epilepsy or focal epilepsy, depending on where the seizures originate in your brain. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:Generalized epilepsy: Seizures involve both sides of the brain from the start. These often include tonic-clonic seizures (what people typically think of as a \"grand mal\" seizure).Focal epilepsy: Seizures start in one area of the brain and may or may not spread. These can cause a wide range of symptoms depending on the brain region involved.Your neurologist can help clarify this based on your EEG and seizure history.4. Why Seizures Seem to Happen \u201cOut of Nowhere\u201dEven if you can\u2019t identify a trigger, there\u2019s often an underlying neurological explanation. Seizures occur due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and this can happen without an obvious external cause. Some possible reasons include:Subtle brain changes: Even if an MRI or EEG doesn\u2019t show anything, there might be microscopic changes in your brain\u2019s structure or function.Threshold fluctuations: Your brain\u2019s seizure threshold (how easily a seizure is triggered) can vary due to factors like stress, sleep, or even your menstrual cycle if you\u2019re female.Randomness: Sometimes, the brain\u2019s electrical activity just becomes unstable, leading to a seizure.5. What You Can DoKeep a seizure diary: Track when seizures happen, how long they last, and any potential triggers (even if they seem unrelated). Over time, patterns might emerge.Take medication consistently: If you\u2019ve been prescribed anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), taking them regularly is crucial to prevent seizures.Avoid known triggers: Even if your seizures seem random, minimizing common triggers like lack of sleep, stress, or alcohol can help.Stay informed: Work closely with your neurologist to understand your specific type of epilepsy and treatment options.6. Living with EpilepsyIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re able to go out and enjoy life without being overly restricted by your condition. Many people with epilepsy live full, active lives. However, it\u2019s important to take some precautions, such as:Letting close friends or family know about your condition.Avoiding activities that could be dangerous if you had a seizure (e.g., swimming alone, climbing ladders).Wearing a medical ID bracelet in case you have a seizure in public.7. Seek SupportIf you haven\u2019t already, consider connecting with epilepsy support groups (online or in person). Talking to others who have similar experiences can be incredibly helpful. Organizations like Epilepsy Action (UK) or the Epilepsy Foundation (US) offer resources and support.Final ThoughtsYour experience with epilepsy is valid, and it\u2019s not uncommon for seizures to seem random and unexplained. The good news is that with proper management, many people with epilepsy achieve good seizure control. Keep working with your healthcare team, stay informed, and don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.If you have more specific questions or want to share more about your experience, feel free to ask!"

        "question": "I am not a doctor, but I know my body and I am no fool. I also try to avoid going to the doctor unless necessary, so I try to make sure I have to go before I do. My doctors tend to mark me up to either being a hypochondriac or having drug seeking behaviour.For example: I have very severe epilepsy, and the Keppra I am on is no longer working; I am having multiple seizures in a row every month along with, almost constant myoclonic jerks in my legs. I asked my doctor to please change me from the Keppra about 6 months ago, when it first started showing signs of no longer working. Last month I had 9 focal-to-generalized seizures without becoming aware between them.In short, pharmaceutical companies tell me to ask my doctor about certain meds, but when I do, they blow me off.Bonus Question: What do you recommend for these seizures? They are almost always triggered by hormones, stress level, and being asleep.Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing with your epilepsy and the difficulties in getting the care you need. It's important to have a trusting relationship with your healthcare provider, especially when managing a chronic condition like epilepsy. Here are some steps you might consider:1. Seek a Second OpinionIf your current doctor is not taking your concerns seriously, it may be time to seek a second opinion from another neurologist or epilepsy specialist. A fresh perspective can sometimes make a big difference.2. Document Your SymptomsKeep a detailed seizure diary. Record the date, time, duration, type of seizure, potential triggers (like stress, sleep patterns, hormonal changes), and any other relevant details. This documentation can provide concrete evidence to your doctor about the frequency and severity of your seizures.3. Advocate for YourselfWhen you visit your doctor, be clear and concise about your symptoms and how they are affecting your quality of life. Use your seizure diary to back up your concerns. You might say something like, I\u2019ve been having multiple seizures a month, and here\u2019s the data to show it. I need to explore other treatment options.4. Discuss Alternative MedicationsThere are many anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) available, and if Keppra (levetiracetam) is no longer effective, your doctor should consider other options. Some commonly used AEDs include:Lamotrigine (Lamictal)Valproate (Depakote)Carbamazepine (Tegretol)Topiramate (Topamax)Lacosamide (Vimpat)Brivaracetam (Briviact) \u2013 similar to Keppra but may have fewer side effects for some people.Your doctor might also consider combination therapy if a single medication isn\u2019t sufficient.5. Consider Non-Pharmacological OptionsIf medications alone aren\u2019t controlling your seizures, discuss other treatments with your doctor, such as:Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)Ketogenic Diet \u2013 A high-fat, low-carb diet that has been shown to help some people with epilepsy.CBD (Cannabidiol) \u2013 Epidiolex is an FDA-approved CBD medication for certain types of epilepsy.6. Address Hormonal TriggersSince your seizures are often triggered by hormonal changes, you might want to discuss with your doctor whether hormonal therapy or adjustments could help. For example, some women with catamenial epilepsy (seizures linked to the menstrual cycle) find relief with hormonal treatments like progesterone.7. Stress and Sleep ManagementSince stress and sleep are triggers, consider incorporating stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness, yoga, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Prioritize good sleep hygiene to minimize sleep-related triggers.8. Consider an Epilepsy CenterIf your seizures remain uncontrolled despite treatment, you might benefit from being evaluated at a comprehensive epilepsy center. These centers offer specialized care, including advanced diagnostic testing and access to clinical trials.Bonus Answer: Recommendations for Hormone-Triggered SeizuresHormonal Therapy: If your seizures are linked to your menstrual cycle, hormonal treatments like progesterone might help.Clobazam (Onfi): This benzodiazepine is sometimes used as an add-on therapy for catamenial epilepsy.Adjusting AED Timing: Sometimes, adjusting the timing or dosage of your medication around your hormonal cycle can help.Final ThoughtsIt\u2019s crucial to have a healthcare provider who listens to you and takes your concerns seriously. If you feel dismissed or unheard, it\u2019s within your rights to seek care elsewhere. Epilepsy is a serious condition, and uncontrolled seizures can have significant consequences, so don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for the care you need.If you\u2019re in the U.S., the Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) is a great resource for finding specialists, support groups, and additional information about managing epilepsy."

        "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d.

        "answer": "I'm so sorry you're going through this\u2014it sounds incredibly stressful and overwhelming. It's clear that you care deeply for your partner and want to do what's best for him. Here are some steps and considerations to help you navigate this difficult situation:1. Prioritize His SafetyDuring a Seizure: You're already doing the right thing by ensuring he doesn't fall, laying him on his side, and staying with him until he recovers. Make sure the area around him is clear of sharp or hard objects.Post-Seizure Care: After a seizure, he may be confused, irritable, or even aggressive. This is common and not personal. Give him space if he needs it, but keep an eye on him to ensure he doesn't injure himself.2. Know When to Seek Emergency HelpCall an Ambulance If:A seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.He has multiple seizures in a row without regaining consciousness (status epilepticus).He is injured during the seizure (e.g., hitting his head).He has difficulty breathing or turns blue.He doesn't regain consciousness or seems unusually confused or unwell after the seizure.Licensing Concerns: While losing his license is a valid concern, his life and health come first. If you feel he needs emergency care, don't hesitate to call for help.3. Communicate with His FamilyHis grandmother may have more experience with his condition, but trust your instincts if you feel something is seriously wrong. Ask her:How long his seizure clusters typically last.What his usual post-seizure behavior is like.Whether his doctor has provided specific instructions for when to seek emergency care.If his family is dismissive of your concerns, gently remind them that you're acting out of love and concern for his well-being.4. Encourage Medical Follow-UpIf this cluster of seizures is unusual or more severe than his baseline, he may need to see his neurologist. His medication regimen might need adjustment.When he's coherent, try to calmly explain that you're worried and want to help him feel better. Suggest calling his doctor to discuss the recent increase in seizures.5. Take Care of YourselfCaring for someone with frequent seizures can be emotionally and physically exhausting. Make sure you're eating, resting, and seeking support when you need it.Consider reaching out to a support group for caregivers of people with epilepsy. They can offer advice, understanding, and coping strategies.6. Address His Resistance to HelpHis irritability and refusal of medication may be due to post-seizure confusion, frustration, or even side effects of his condition or medications. Try to:Approach him calmly and gently when he's awake.Reassure him that you're on his side and just want to help.If he continues to refuse medication, document this and let his family or doctor know.7. Document the SeizuresKeep a log of his seizures, including:Date and time.Duration.Type (e.g., grand mal, cognitive).Any triggers or unusual circumstances.His behavior before and after.This information will be helpful for his doctor and can help identify patterns or changes in his condition.8. Consider a Medical Alert SystemIf he's prone to frequent seizures, a medical alert bracelet or necklace with his condition and emergency contact information could be helpful in case he has a seizure when you're not around.9. Trust Your InstinctsIf you feel his condition is worsening or his family isn't taking it seriously enough, don't hesitate to advocate for him. You're his partner, and your perspective matters.Final ThoughtsIt's clear that you're doing your best in a very challenging situation. Remember, you're not alone\u2014reach out to his medical team, support groups, or trusted friends for guidance and emotional support. Your care and concern are making a difference, even if it doesn't always feel that way."

        "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Anxiety and stress themselves do not directly cause epilepsy, but they can potentially trigger seizures in individuals who already have epilepsy or are predisposed to it. Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, which are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. While stress and anxiety do not cause epilepsy, they can lower the seizure threshold in people who are already at risk or have the condition, making seizures more likely.For someone without a history of epilepsy or seizures, it is highly unlikely that anxiety or stress alone would lead to the development of epilepsy. However, extreme stress or trauma could, in rare cases, lead to non-epileptic seizures (also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or PNES). These seizures are not caused by abnormal brain activity but are instead related to psychological factors. They can look similar to epileptic seizures but require different treatment, often involving mental health support.If you or someone you know is experiencing seizures or unusual symptoms, it\u2019s important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can determine whether the symptoms are related to epilepsy, stress, or another condition."

She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \\\"respond\\\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

        "answer": "I\u2019m sorry to hear about your daughter\u2019s ongoing pain and struggles. Given her complex medical history, current symptoms, and normal lab results, her abdominal pain and associated symptoms could be related to a combination of factors, including her neurogenic bowel/bladder disorder, medication side effects, or a new underlying condition. Here are some possibilities to consider and discuss with her healthcare team:1. Neurogenic Bowel DysfunctionHer enlarged colon and neurogenic bowel disorder could be contributing to chronic abdominal pain. Despite her current bowel regimen, she may still be experiencing partial blockages, stool retention, or colonic distension, which can cause significant pain, especially after eating or physical activity.The localized pain to the right of her navel could suggest issues with the ascending colon or cecum, which might be impacted by her bowel anatomy and motility issues.Consider: A repeat abdominal X-ray or CT scan to evaluate for stool retention, colonic distension, or structural abnormalities. A gastroenterologist may also recommend motility studies or a colonoscopy to assess for other causes of pain.2. Medication Side EffectsLinzess, Lactulose, and Bisacodyl: These medications can cause cramping, bloating, and abdominal discomfort, especially if her bowel is not emptying effectively.Lamictal and Keppra: Both antiepileptic drugs can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including abdominal pain and appetite suppression.Consider: Reviewing her medications with her neurologist and gastroenterologist to determine if any adjustments could alleviate her symptoms.3. Functional Gastrointestinal DisorderGiven her normal lab results and lack of structural abnormalities on imaging, she may have a functional gastrointestinal disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS).These conditions can be exacerbated by stress, anxiety, and sensory processing issues, which she already struggles with.Consider: A trial of a low-FODMAP diet (under the guidance of a dietitian) to see if certain foods are triggering her pain. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or biofeedback may also help manage pain and anxiety.4. Gastroparesis or Delayed Gastric EmptyingHer feeling of a \u201clump in her throat\u201d (globus sensation) and worsening pain after eating could suggest delayed gastric emptying or gastroparesis.This could be related to her neuropathy or autonomic dysfunction, given her history of temperature regulation issues and anhidrosis.Consider: A gastric emptying study to evaluate how well her stomach is emptying. If gastroparesis is confirmed, dietary modifications (smaller, more frequent meals) or medications like metoclopramide or erythromycin could be considered.5. Autonomic DysfunctionHer dizziness/lightheadedness, temperature regulation issues, and anhidrosis suggest possible autonomic dysfunction, which could also affect gastrointestinal motility and contribute to abdominal pain.Consider: Autonomic testing (e.g., tilt table test, sweat test) to evaluate for dysautonomia. If confirmed, treatments like increased fluid/electrolyte intake, compression stockings, or medications like fludrocortisone or midodrine may help.6. Chronic Pain SyndromeGiven her extensive medical history and chronic pain, she may be developing a centralized pain syndrome, where the nervous system becomes hypersensitive to pain signals.This could explain why her pain is constant and fluctuates in intensity.Consider: A referral to a pediatric pain management specialist. Treatments may include physical therapy, nerve modulation techniques, or medications like gabapentin or amitriptyline.7. Other ConsiderationsGallbladder or Pancreatic Issues: Pain localized to the right side of her abdomen could suggest gallbladder dysfunction (e.g., biliary dyskinesia) or pancreatic issues. An ultrasound or HIDA scan could rule this out.Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO): Given her bowel anatomy and motility issues, SIBO could be contributing to her symptoms. A breath test could help diagnose this.Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS): Given her joint issues, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms, EDS (a connective tissue disorder) could be a possibility. A genetics evaluation could be considered.Next Steps:Multidisciplinary Approach: Given the complexity of her case, she may benefit from a team approach involving a pediatric gastroenterologist, neurologist, pain management specialist, and dietitian.Imaging and Testing: Consider additional imaging (e.g., abdominal X-ray, CT, or MRI) and motility studies to evaluate her gastrointestinal tract.Dietary Modifications: Work with a dietitian to explore dietary triggers and ensure she is getting adequate nutrition despite her reduced appetite.Pain Management: Explore non-pharmacological pain management strategies (e.g., CBT, biofeedback, physical therapy) and discuss medication options with her doctors.Her symptoms are clearly impacting her quality of life, and I hope her medical team can work together to find answers and provide relief. Keep advocating for her\u2014complex cases often require persistence and collaboration among specialists."

        "question": "Not sure if this is allowed- (20F/medical MJ patient/white) I've been trying to get this figured out for YEARS now, no one takes me seriously. Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry you're dealing with this\u2014it sounds really unsettling and frustrating, especially when you feel like you're not being taken seriously. What you're describing could indeed be related to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is a type of focal epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobes of the brain. The symptoms you're experiencing\u2014deja vu, nausea, head tingling/pressure, and the episodic nature of these events\u2014are classic hallmarks of TLE. Let me break this down for you:Key Symptoms of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:Deja Vu or Jamais Vu: A strong feeling of familiarity (deja vu) or unfamiliarity (jamais vu) with your surroundings.Epigastric Sensations: A rising feeling in your stomach, often accompanied by nausea.Autonomic Symptoms: Tingling, pressure, or other unusual sensations in the head or body.Brief Episodes: These events typically last seconds to minutes and often recur in clusters.Altered Awareness: You might feel out of it or disconnected during or after the episode.Your description of the pressure in the occipital lobe and temples is interesting, as TLE typically involves the temporal lobes. However, seizure activity can sometimes spread to other areas of the brain, which might explain the sensations you're feeling in other regions.Why This Might Be TLE:The episodic nature of your symptoms (coming and going in clusters) is very consistent with epilepsy.The deja vu and nausea are classic auras, which are focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures) that don't necessarily progress to a full-blown seizure.The tingling and pressure could be related to abnormal electrical activity in the brain during these episodes.What You Can Do:See a Neurologist, Preferably an Epileptologist: If you haven't already, you need to see a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy (an epileptologist). They are more likely to take your symptoms seriously and have the expertise to diagnose TLE.Bring your logs! They\u2019ll be incredibly helpful for the doctor to see patterns and triggers.Request an EEG (Electroencephalogram): This test measures brain activity and can detect abnormal electrical patterns associated with epilepsy. Since your episodes are sporadic, they might recommend a long-term EEG or ambulatory EEG to capture an episode.Consider an MRI: An MRI can rule out structural issues in the brain (like tumors or lesions) that might be causing your symptoms.Keep Tracking Your Symptoms: Your logs are a great idea. Note any potential triggers (stress, lack of sleep, certain foods, etc.) and how you feel before, during, and after the episodes.Ask About Medication: If this is TLE, anti-seizure medications (like lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or carbamazepine) can often control the symptoms effectively.Other Possibilities to Rule Out:While TLE seems like a strong possibility, other conditions can cause similar symptoms:Migraines with Aura: Some types of migraines can cause deja vu, nausea, and head pressure.Panic Attacks: These can sometimes mimic seizure-like symptoms, including nausea and tingling.Vestibular Disorders: Issues with the inner ear or balance system can cause nausea and disorientation.Medical Marijuana Considerations:Since you're a medical MJ patient, it's worth discussing this with your doctor. While some people find cannabis helpful for seizure control (e.g., in conditions like Dravet syndrome), it can sometimes interact with medications or affect brain activity in unpredictable ways. Make sure your neurologist knows about your cannabis use.Final Thoughts:You're doing the right thing by tracking your symptoms and advocating for yourself. Temporal lobe epilepsy is often underdiagnosed because the symptoms can be subtle and mistaken for other conditions. Push for a referral to a neurologist or epileptologist, and don't give up until you get answers. You deserve to feel better and have clarity about what's going on.Let me know if you have more questions\u2014I'm here to help!"

One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of complex and overlapping symptoms, and it's frustrating when tests come back inconclusive. While I can't diagnose you, I can offer some thoughts and suggestions that might help guide your discussions with your doctors.Key Considerations:Autoimmune Conditions:Your symptoms (joint pain, mouth sores, fatigue, low fevers, hair loss, and potential neurological symptoms) could point to an autoimmune condition like lupus (as your rheumatologist suggested) or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (which can cause dry lips/mouth, joint pain, and fatigue).The ANA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 tests your rheumatologist ordered are crucial for evaluating lupus. If these come back positive, it could provide clarity.Neurological Symptoms:The episodes you describe (uncontrollable movements, rigidity, impaired thought process) are concerning and could be related to a neurological condition. The disagreement among your doctors about whether these are seizures, chorea, or something else highlights the complexity.Since your EEG and brain CT were normal, it might be worth exploring other neurological conditions, such as:Functional Neurological Disorder (FND): A condition where stress or psychological factors manifest as physical symptoms.Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Though less likely given your normal brain CT, MS can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms.Autoimmune Encephalitis: This can cause seizures, movement disorders, and cognitive changes.Medication Side Effects:While you've been on Wellbutrin and Cymbalta for years without issues, it's worth considering whether these medications could be contributing to your symptoms. For example:Wellbutrin can lower the seizure threshold in some people.Cymbalta can cause withdrawal symptoms (e.g., \"brain zaps\") if doses are missed or adjusted.Discuss with your psychiatrist whether a medication change or taper might be warranted.Hormonal or Cyclical Factors:Your symptoms worsening before your period suggest a possible hormonal component. Conditions like PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) or endometriosis can cause cyclical symptoms, though they don't fully explain your neurological issues.Nutritional Deficiencies:Deficiencies in vitamin B12, iron, or vitamin D can cause fatigue, neurological symptoms, and hair loss. Have these been checked?Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME) or Fibromyalgia:These conditions are diagnoses of exclusion and could explain your fatigue and pain, though they don't account for all your symptoms.Next Steps:Complete the Autoimmune Workup:Make sure you get the ANA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 tests done, ideally during a flare-up of symptoms.Consider a Neurological Referral:A neurologist specializing in movement disorders or autoimmune neurology might be helpful. They could consider advanced testing like an MRI or lumbar puncture.Track Your Symptoms:Keep a detailed symptom diary, noting when symptoms occur, their severity, and any potential triggers (e.g., stress, diet, menstrual cycle).Reevaluate Medications:Discuss with your psychiatrist whether your current medications could be contributing to your symptoms.Explore Other Testing:If autoimmune and neurological tests remain inconclusive, consider testing for Lyme disease, heavy metal toxicity, or mold exposure, as these can cause similar symptoms.Supportive Care:In the meantime, focus on managing symptoms:For dry lips/mouth sores: Use a humidifier, stay hydrated, and try products like Biotene for dry mouth.For joint pain: Gentle stretching, heat therapy, or over-the-counter pain relievers (if approved by your doctor).For fatigue: Prioritize rest and consider pacing activities to conserve energy.When to Seek Immediate Help:If your episodes worsen, you lose consciousness, or you develop new symptoms like severe headaches, vision changes, or difficulty breathing, seek emergency care.Hang in there\u2014it can take time to get answers, but advocating for yourself and working with a multidisciplinary team (rheumatologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, etc.) will increase your chances of finding clarity. Let me know if you have more questions or updates!"

        "question": "I\u2019m 25 with seizures, been seizure free for about 5 years, I\u2019m on 200mg twice a day medication is lamotrigne, I\u2019m a heavy smoker I\u2019m a female I weigh 139lbs I\u2019m 5\u20196. Can I take shrooms?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you make an informed decision. However, it\u2019s crucial to consult your healthcare provider before considering any substance, especially given your medical history.Key Considerations:Seizure History: You\u2019ve been seizure-free for 5 years, which is great, but psychedelics like psilocybin (the active compound in shrooms) can affect brain activity and potentially lower the seizure threshold. This could increase the risk of a seizure, even if you\u2019ve been stable on medication.Medication Interaction: Lamotrigine (Lamictal) is an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy and stabilize mood. Psilocybin could interact with your medication, potentially altering its effectiveness or causing unexpected side effects. There\u2019s limited research on this specific interaction, so caution is advised.Smoking: Heavy smoking can affect your cardiovascular and respiratory health, which could influence how your body processes substances like psilocybin. It\u2019s not a direct contraindication, but it\u2019s worth considering.Mental Health: Psychedelics can have profound psychological effects. If you have a history of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions, psilocybin could exacerbate these issues or trigger unexpected emotional responses.Dosage and Setting: If you were to proceed (after consulting a doctor), starting with a very low dose in a safe, controlled environment with a trusted person present would be essential. However, given your medical history, the risks may outweigh the potential benefits.What to Do:Consult Your Doctor: Speak with your neurologist or healthcare provider about your interest in psilocybin. They can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current medications.Consider Alternatives: If you\u2019re exploring shrooms for mental health or personal growth, there may be safer, evidence-based alternatives, such as therapy or other treatments.Avoid Self-Experimentation: Without medical guidance, experimenting with psychedelics could pose significant risks to your health.Your safety is the top priority, so please seek professional medical advice before making any decisions."

        "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy\u2014frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m not a doctor, but I can provide some general insights based on the information you\u2019ve shared. Your case is complex and involves two significant issues: epilepsy and unexplained osteoporosis with spontaneous fractures. Here are some potential considerations and directions for further investigation:1. Possible Causes of Osteoporosis and FracturesIdiopathic Osteoporosis in Young Adults: While osteoporosis is rare in young men, it can occur without a clear cause (idiopathic). However, your case is unusual given the severity and the lack of obvious risk factors.Secondary Causes of Osteoporosis: Your doctors have likely ruled out many secondary causes, but it\u2019s worth reiterating some possibilities:Endocrine Disorders: Conditions like hypogonadism (low testosterone), hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, or Cushing\u2019s syndrome can lead to bone loss. Your endocrinologist would have checked for these, but subtle or intermittent cases might be missed.Vitamin D Deficiency or Malabsorption: Even if your labs appear normal, subtle issues with vitamin D metabolism or calcium absorption could contribute.Celiac Disease or Other Malabsorption Syndromes: These can lead to nutrient deficiencies and osteoporosis, even without obvious gastrointestinal symptoms.Chronic Inflammation or Autoimmune Diseases: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis can affect bone health.Medication Effects: While Lexapro (escitalopram) is not strongly linked to osteoporosis, some SSRIs have been associated with bone loss in long-term use. This is unlikely to fully explain your case, but it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor.Genetic Disorders: Rare genetic conditions like osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) or other connective tissue disorders could be considered, though these typically present earlier in life.2. Possible Causes of EpilepsyStructural Brain Abnormalities: Focal-aware seizures often suggest a localized brain issue. An MRI would have been done to rule out tumors, scars, or other structural abnormalities.Metabolic or Systemic Causes: Seizures can sometimes be triggered by metabolic imbalances (e.g., electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia) or systemic diseases.Autoimmune Epilepsy: Some forms of epilepsy are caused by autoimmune conditions that affect the brain (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis). These can be subtle and may require specific antibody testing.Genetic Factors: Genetic mutations can cause epilepsy, even without a family history. Genetic testing might be considered if no other cause is found.3. Possible Connection Between Epilepsy and OsteoporosisShared Underlying Cause: It\u2019s possible that both your epilepsy and osteoporosis are symptoms of a broader, undiagnosed condition. For example:Mitochondrial Disorders: These can affect multiple systems, including the brain and bones.Autoimmune or Inflammatory Conditions: Some systemic diseases can impact both the nervous system and bone metabolism.Paraneoplastic Syndromes: Rarely, cancers can produce substances that affect both the brain and bones, even if the cancer itself is not yet detectable.Medication or Lifestyle Factors: If you\u2019ve been prescribed anti-seizure medications (e.g., phenytoin, valproate), some of these can contribute to bone loss over time. However, it sounds like your bone issues predate any epilepsy treatment.4. Next StepsComprehensive Genetic Testing: Given the unusual nature of your case, genetic testing for rare metabolic, connective tissue, or neurological disorders might be warranted.Advanced Imaging: If not already done, a full-body MRI or PET scan could help identify hidden systemic issues.Bone Biopsy: In cases of unexplained osteoporosis, a bone biopsy can sometimes reveal clues about bone turnover or underlying pathology.Second Opinions: Consider seeking a second opinion from a major academic medical center with specialists in metabolic bone diseases and neurology.Monitor for New Symptoms: Keep track of any new or evolving symptoms, as these could provide clues to an underlying diagnosis.5. Management in the MeantimeBone Health: Ensure you\u2019re getting adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise. Your doctors may recommend medications like bisphosphonates to strengthen your bones.Seizure Management: Work closely with your neurologist to optimize seizure control while minimizing side effects from medications.Mental Health Support: Dealing with chronic health issues can be challenging. Continue to prioritize your mental health and consider counseling or support groups if needed.Your case is highly unusual and warrants a multidisciplinary approach. It\u2019s important to keep advocating for yourself and exploring all possible avenues for diagnosis and treatment. If your current team is stumped, seeking care at a specialized center (e.g., Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, or similar) might be beneficial."

        "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m sorry to hear about your son\u2019s recent seizure and the anxiety this has caused. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel concerned, especially with an upcoming trip and the lack of a clear diagnosis or treatment plan. Here\u2019s some constructive advice to help you make an informed decision:Key Considerations:Risk of Another Seizure:Since this was your son\u2019s first tonic-clonic seizure, the likelihood of a recurrence in the short term can vary. However, the fact that he has been having \"absent moments\" (which could be absence seizures or another type of episodic event) for months suggests there may be an underlying neurological issue that needs evaluation.Without a diagnosis or treatment, the risk of another seizure cannot be ruled out, especially in situations that might trigger seizures (e.g., stress, fatigue, dehydration, or flashing lights, depending on the cause).Remote Location:Being 30 minutes from the nearest hospital adds a layer of risk. If another seizure occurs, especially a prolonged one (lasting more than 5 minutes), prompt medical attention would be critical.Driving Safety:If your son were to have a seizure during the journey, it could pose a serious risk, especially if you\u2019re on the road. Many countries, including the UK, have legal restrictions on driving after a seizure, and it\u2019s generally advised to avoid driving until a diagnosis is made and the condition is controlled.Stress and Fatigue:Travel, especially long drives, can be tiring and stressful, which might increase the risk of a seizure in someone with an undiagnosed seizure disorder.Recommendations:Consult a Doctor Before the Trip:While you\u2019re waiting for the paediatrician appointment, consider contacting your GP or NHS 111 for urgent advice. Explain the situation and your travel plans. They may be able to expedite the referral or provide interim guidance.If your son has another seizure before the trip, seek immediate medical attention and reassess the travel plans.Consider Postponing the Trip:Given the uncertainty and potential risks, postponing the trip until you have a diagnosis and a management plan might be the safest option. This would allow you to:Understand the nature of your son\u2019s condition.Have a treatment plan in place (e.g., anti-seizure medication if needed).Feel more prepared to handle any medical emergencies.If You Decide to Go:Ensure you have travel insurance that covers pre-existing conditions and emergency medical care abroad.Familiarize yourself with the nearest hospital and emergency services in the area you\u2019ll be staying.Avoid triggers that could provoke a seizure (e.g., ensure your son gets enough sleep, stays hydrated, and avoids excessive stress).Have a plan in place for what to do if a seizure occurs (e.g., knowing how to position him safely, timing the seizure, and when to call for emergency help).Seizure First Aid:Educate yourself and anyone traveling with you on how to handle a seizure:Stay calm and ensure your son is in a safe position (on his side to prevent choking).Do not restrain him or put anything in his mouth.Time the seizure; if it lasts more than 5 minutes or if he has multiple seizures without regaining consciousness, seek emergency medical help.Final Thoughts:While it\u2019s possible that your son\u2019s seizure was an isolated incident, the history of absent moments suggests this may be part of an ongoing condition. Without a diagnosis or treatment, the risk of another seizure cannot be ignored, especially in a remote location. Postponing the trip until you have more information and a plan in place would likely be the most prudent decision for your son\u2019s safety and your peace of mind.If you do decide to go, take all possible precautions and ensure you\u2019re prepared to handle a medical emergency. Ultimately, your instincts as a parent are important\u2014if you feel uneasy about the trip, it\u2019s okay to prioritize your son\u2019s health and reschedule."

        "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to be concerned about persistent blood in your urine (hematuria), especially when the cause isn't immediately clear. Given your medical history, medications, and the absence of symptoms like pain or signs of infection, your doctor will likely want to investigate further to rule out any underlying conditions. Here are some possible next steps your doctor might consider:1. Repeat UrinalysisYour doctor may order another urinalysis to confirm the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) and check for other abnormalities (e.g., protein, white blood cells, or casts).They might also request a urine culture to rule out a subtle or low-grade urinary tract infection (UTI).2. Imaging StudiesKidney Ultrasound: This is a non-invasive way to check for kidney stones, cysts, or structural abnormalities in your kidneys or bladder.CT Scan: If kidney stones are suspected but not visible on an ultrasound, a CT scan (often without contrast) is the gold standard for detecting small stones or other abnormalities.MRI: Less common for this purpose, but it might be used if there are concerns about radiation exposure (e.g., in younger patients).3. Blood TestsYour doctor might order blood tests to assess kidney function (e.g., creatinine, BUN, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)) and check for signs of inflammation or autoimmune conditions.Since you\u2019re on Lithium, which can affect kidney function over time, your doctor may want to monitor your kidney health more closely.4. CystoscopyIf no cause is found through imaging or lab tests, your doctor might recommend a cystoscopy. This procedure involves using a thin, flexible scope to examine the inside of your bladder and urethra for abnormalities like tumors, inflammation, or other issues.5. Nephrology ReferralIf the hematuria persists and no obvious cause is found, your doctor might refer you to a nephrologist (kidney specialist) for further evaluation. They may investigate less common causes, such as:Glomerular disease: Conditions affecting the kidney's filtering units (e.g., IgA nephropathy).Autoimmune conditions: Lupus or other systemic diseases that can affect the kidneys.Genetic conditions: Rarely, conditions like Alport syndrome or thin basement membrane disease can cause hematuria.6. MonitoringIf all tests come back normal and there are no symptoms, your doctor might opt for a \"watch and wait\" approach, repeating tests periodically to ensure the hematuria doesn\u2019t worsen or lead to other issues.Possible Causes of Hematuria in Your CaseKidney Stones: Even small stones can cause microscopic hematuria without symptoms.Medications: While you weren\u2019t on Lithium at the time of the first test, some medications (e.g., NSAIDs, blood thinners) can cause hematuria. Buspirone and Lamictal are less commonly associated with this.Exercise-Induced Hematuria: Intense physical activity can sometimes cause blood in the urine.Structural Abnormalities: Congenital issues or benign growths in the urinary tract.Glomerular Causes: Conditions affecting the kidney's filtering system, though these are less common in young, otherwise healthy individuals.What You Can Do While Waiting for Your AppointmentStay hydrated to help flush your urinary system.Avoid NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) unless prescribed, as they can sometimes worsen kidney-related issues.Keep track of any new symptoms, such as pain, changes in urine color, or fever, and report them to your doctor.Final ThoughtsGiven your age and lack of symptoms, the likelihood of a serious underlying condition is low. However, persistent hematuria should always be evaluated to rule out less common but important causes. Your doctor will likely proceed step-by-step, starting with non-invasive tests and moving to more specialized evaluations if needed.Let me know if you have further questions or if you\u2019d like help interpreting your lab results!"

I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand your situation better. However, it\u2019s important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.Possible Causes of Your Symptoms:Photosensitivity or Seizure-Like Reaction:Even though your epilepsy test at 15 was negative, exposure to bright and fast lights can trigger photosensitive reactions in some people, even if they don\u2019t have epilepsy. This could cause symptoms like shaking, dizziness, and vomiting. However, these symptoms are not exclusive to epilepsy and could be related to other conditions.Vestibular Migraine:Migraines can sometimes be triggered by visual stimuli like flashing lights. Vestibular migraines can cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound.Panic or Anxiety Attack:Exposure to overwhelming stimuli (like bright, fast lights) could trigger a panic attack, which might cause shaking, nausea, dizziness, and numbness.Hormonal Imbalance:Since you mentioned having hormonal issues and taking medication (Normocis), hormonal fluctuations could potentially contribute to symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and sensitivity to stimuli.Low Blood Sugar or Dehydration:If you hadn\u2019t eaten or hydrated properly, low blood sugar or dehydration could cause dizziness, nausea, and shaking.Other Neurological or Autonomic Issues:Conditions like dysautonomia (issues with the autonomic nervous system) could cause symptoms like dizziness, numbness, and nausea.Why It Might Not Be Epilepsy:Your previous evaluation for epilepsy was negative, and epilepsy typically involves recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Your symptoms seem to have been triggered by a specific event (exposure to bright, fast lights), which might suggest a different cause.However, epilepsy can develop later in life, and photosensitive epilepsy is a specific type that can be triggered by flashing lights. If this happens again, it\u2019s worth discussing with a neurologist.What You Should Do:See a Doctor:Describe your symptoms in detail, including the trigger (bright, fast lights) and how long the episode lasted. A neurologist might recommend further testing, such as an EEG, to rule out epilepsy or other neurological conditions.Track Your Symptoms:Keep a diary of any similar episodes, including triggers, symptoms, and how long they last. This can help your doctor identify patterns.Avoid Triggers:Until you have more clarity, try to avoid exposure to bright, flashing lights or other stimuli that seem to trigger your symptoms.Review Your Medications:Discuss your current medications (like Normocis) with your doctor to ensure they aren\u2019t contributing to your symptoms.Consider a Holistic Approach:If hormonal imbalances are part of the issue, working with an endocrinologist to optimize your treatment might help.When to Seek Immediate Help:If you experience another episode with severe symptoms like prolonged shaking, loss of consciousness, or difficulty breathing, seek emergency medical care.Your symptoms are concerning and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment."

        "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\\\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through all of this. It sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an incredibly challenging situation, and it\u2019s completely understandable to feel terrified. Let\u2019s address your concerns one by one, but please remember that I\u2019m not a doctor, and you should consult with your neurologist or a specialist for personalized medical advice.1. Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures?Uncontrolled seizures, especially tonic-clonic seizures, can carry risks that may affect lifespan. These risks include injuries, accidents, aspiration (as you experienced), and a condition called SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy). However, many people with epilepsy live long lives, especially with proper management. The key is to work closely with your healthcare team to reduce seizure frequency and minimize risks.2. Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery?Chiari 1 malformation with a syrinx (syrinx is a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord) can sometimes be treated with posterior fossa decompression surgery. This surgery aims to relieve pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord, which may help with symptoms related to Chiari and the syrinx. Whether you\u2019re a candidate depends on:The severity of your symptoms (e.g., seizures, neurological deficits).Imaging findings (MRI results showing the size and location of the Chiari and syrinx).Your overall health and ability to undergo surgery.A neurosurgeon specializing in Chiari malformations would need to evaluate you to determine if surgery is appropriate.3. Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy?Spinal decompression surgery is primarily aimed at addressing Chiari-related symptoms and the syrinx. While it may improve some neurological symptoms, it is not specifically designed to treat epilepsy. However, in some cases, reducing pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord can indirectly improve seizure control, especially if the seizures are linked to the Chiari malformation. This is something your neurologist and neurosurgeon would need to discuss in detail.4. How much should I worry about SUDEP?SUDEP is a rare but serious concern for people with epilepsy, particularly those with frequent tonic-clonic seizures. The overall risk of SUDEP is estimated to be about 1 in 1,000 people with epilepsy per year, but it can be higher if seizures are poorly controlled. To reduce your risk:Take your medications consistently.Avoid known seizure triggers (e.g., lack of sleep, stress, alcohol).Consider using a seizure alert device or having someone monitor you at night.Discuss with your neurologist whether additional treatments (e.g., adjusting medications, VNS, or surgery) could help.5. What do I do now?Here are some steps you can take to address your situation:Consult a specialist: Seek out a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy and a neurosurgeon familiar with Chiari malformations. They can provide a comprehensive evaluation and discuss treatment options, including surgery.Explore advanced treatments: If medications aren\u2019t working, ask about other options like:Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)Epilepsy surgery (if a specific seizure focus can be identified).Address Chiari and syrinx: If your seizures are linked to Chiari, treating the malformation may help. A neurosurgeon can guide you on whether decompression surgery is appropriate.Lifestyle adjustments: Maintain a regular sleep schedule, reduce stress, and avoid seizure triggers.Support system: Reach out to support groups for epilepsy and Chiari malformation. Connecting with others who understand your experience can be incredibly helpful.Emergency plan: Make sure those around you know how to respond during a seizure (e.g., turning you on your side to prevent aspiration).Final ThoughtsYou\u2019re dealing with a lot, but there are still options to explore. It\u2019s important to advocate for yourself and seek out specialists who can provide the best care for your unique situation. You\u2019re not alone, and there are resources and treatments that may help improve your quality of life. Please don\u2019t hesitate to lean on your healthcare team, loved ones, or support groups during this time.If you\u2019d like, I can help you find resources or prepare questions for your next doctor\u2019s appointment. Let me know how else I can support you."

        "question": "i\u2019m currently living with my mom 60F who has had epilepsy for the past 30-ish years. i\u2019ve noticed her memory is declining, especially in the past year or so. it\u2019s not to the point where there could be any sort of formal diagnosis given but it\u2019s starting to concern me. i\u2019ve done some research into the correlation between epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s (or dementia in general) and from what i\u2019ve gathered the strongest correlation is between focal epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s due to the damage to the temporal lobe. my mom has tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) and i\u2019ve been trying to find information on how much her seizures affect the temporal lobe, but i can\u2019t find much and i think that\u2019s partially due to the lack of research. i don\u2019t know who to ask or talk to about this. i don\u2019t want to scare my mom but i\u2019ve scoured google trying to find more information but i can\u2019t seem to find anything. i just have so many questions\u2026is 60 too early to tell? once her memory starts to decline, how long does she have still being lucid? do grand mal seizures damage the temporal lobe in the same way focal seizures do? if that is what\u2019s happening, how do i make her feel loved and comfortable? examples of her memory issues: forgetting what she\u2019s talking about mid sentence (a lot). forgetting the names of people/places/things that she knows well. misplacing/forgetting objects fairly frequently, etc. i don\u2019t except anyone to know all the answers, but any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.EDIT: i understand with age there\u2019s usually going to be some forgetfulness, but this seems excessive to me. i\u2019m obviously not a professional, just a paranoid daughter, but my father is older and his memory is far better. also, more background: 60F, 5\u20192, 120lbs, past history of estrogen binding cancer (has had double mastectomy + hysterectomy); she fractured her neck following a seizure in 2017? i\u2019m not sure which vertebre, but she\u2019s made a full recovery. also she\u2019s had her left? hip replaced and currently suffers with nerve pain. on my maternal side, there\u2019s a lot of history of mental illness (including: BP-1 & 2, schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, major depression, BPD, ASPD, anxiety & panic disorders & some substance abuse - mostly heroin and meth) my mom is only formally diagnosed with clinical depression, and is on medication for both the epilepsy as well as depression. medications include lexapro & lamotrigine (she also briefly was using \\\"speed\\\" which she swears wasn\u2019t meth but there\u2019s a good chance it was)",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about your mom's situation, and it's clear how much you care for her. Memory decline can be a complex issue, especially in someone with a long history of epilepsy and other health concerns. While I\u2019m not a medical professional, I can provide some general information and suggestions that might help you navigate this situation.1. Epilepsy and Memory DeclineTonic-Clonic Seizures and Temporal Lobe Damage: While tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) primarily involve widespread electrical activity in the brain, they can still indirectly affect the temporal lobe, especially if they are prolonged or frequent. The temporal lobe is crucial for memory, and damage to this area (from seizures or other causes) can lead to memory problems. However, the relationship between epilepsy and memory decline is complex and not fully understood.Epilepsy and Dementia Risk: Research does suggest that people with epilepsy, particularly those with focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe, may have a higher risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that everyone with epilepsy will develop dementia. Other factors, such as the frequency and severity of seizures, age, and overall brain health, also play a role.2. Memory Decline at 60Is 60 Too Early?: Memory decline can start at different ages, and 60 is not necessarily too early, especially if there are underlying health issues like epilepsy. However, it\u2019s important to distinguish between normal age-related forgetfulness and more significant cognitive decline. Your mom\u2019s symptoms (e.g., forgetting names, losing track of conversations, misplacing objects) could be early signs of something more concerning, but they could also be related to other factors like stress, medication side effects, or even the aftereffects of seizures.How Long Until Lucidity is Lost?: If your mom is experiencing early signs of dementia, the progression can vary widely. Some people remain lucid for many years, while others may decline more quickly. It\u2019s impossible to predict exactly how things will progress without a formal evaluation.3. Other Factors to ConsiderMedications: Both Lexapro (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an antiepileptic) can have cognitive side effects, including memory issues. It might be worth discussing these medications with her doctor to see if they could be contributing to her memory problems.Mental Health: Your mom\u2019s history of depression and the potential use of stimulants (like \"speed\") could also impact her cognitive function. Depression itself is associated with memory problems, and substance use can exacerbate these issues.Family History: The strong family history of mental illness and substance abuse could indicate a genetic predisposition to cognitive or psychiatric issues, which might be relevant to her current situation.4. What You Can DoConsult a Neurologist: Given your mom\u2019s history of epilepsy and her current memory issues, it would be a good idea to consult a neurologist. They can evaluate her cognitive function, review her seizure history, and determine if further testing (like an MRI or neuropsychological assessment) is needed.Monitor Her Symptoms: Keep a journal of her memory issues, including when they occur and any potential triggers (e.g., after a seizure, during times of stress). This information can be helpful for her doctors.Support Her Emotional Well-Being: If your mom is aware of her memory issues, she might be feeling anxious or frustrated. Reassure her that you\u2019re there to support her, and try to create a calm, structured environment that reduces stress.Encourage Brain-Healthy Habits: While it\u2019s not a cure, encouraging activities that promote brain health (like regular exercise, a balanced diet, and mental stimulation) might help slow cognitive decline.5. Making Her Feel Loved and ComfortableBe Patient: Memory issues can be frustrating for both the person experiencing them and their loved ones. Try to be patient and avoid correcting her too harshly if she forgets something.Engage in Activities Together: Spend time doing activities she enjoys, which can help her feel connected and valued. Even simple things like looking at old photos or listening to music can be comforting.Create Routines: Establishing daily routines can help reduce confusion and make it easier for her to remember important tasks.Seek Support for Yourself: Caring for a loved one with memory issues can be emotionally taxing. Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist to help you cope with your own feelings.6. Next StepsSchedule a Doctor\u2019s Appointment: The first step should be to discuss your concerns with her primary care physician or neurologist. They can guide you on whether further evaluation is needed.Consider a Neuropsychological Evaluation: This type of assessment can provide a detailed picture of her cognitive strengths and weaknesses and help determine if her memory issues are related to epilepsy, medication, or another condition like dementia.It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, but you\u2019re doing the right thing by seeking information and support. Your mom is lucky to have someone who cares so deeply about her well-being."

There were white spots on my brain but maybe that was migraines.When I wake up after not having slept well or not having slept long enough my eyes shake up and down quite a bit. It lasts for a few minutes until I'm up and moving around. Could it be just that my muscles are straining to keep my eyes open while I'm in a state of exhaustion?

Sleep seizures during the depression but they are gone now.Thanks for any input.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your health challenges and the loss of your parents. Your symptoms and medical history are complex, and it\u2019s important to work closely with your healthcare providers to address your concerns. Here are some thoughts on your situation:1. Eye Shaking (Nystagmus) Upon WakingThe shaking of your eyes (nystagmus) when you wake up after poor sleep could be related to several factors:Fatigue and Muscle Strain: As you suggested, exhaustion could strain the muscles controlling your eye movements, leading to temporary nystagmus.Neurological Factors: Given your history of epilepsy, migraines, and possible MS, the nystagmus could be related to your central nervous system. White spots on your brain (seen on MRI) could indicate demyelination (as in MS) or other neurological issues, but migraines can also cause similar findings.Medication Side Effects: Some of your medications (e.g., Epitol, Mirtazapine) could potentially contribute to eye movement abnormalities, especially if you\u2019re dehydrated or sleep-deprived.Next Steps: Mention this symptom to your neurologist. They may want to investigate further, possibly with a repeat MRI or other tests, to rule out progressive neurological conditions.2. Mixed MS DiagnosisThe uncertainty around an MS diagnosis is not uncommon, as its symptoms can overlap with other conditions like migraines, systemic scleroderma, or even epilepsy. White spots on the brain can be caused by migraines, MS, or other inflammatory conditions.Next Steps: If the diagnosis is still unclear, consider seeking a second opinion from an MS specialist or a neurologist who specializes in autoimmune conditions.3. MedicationsEpitol (Carbamazepine): This is an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy and nerve pain. It can cause side effects like dizziness, blurred vision, or nystagmus, especially if levels are too high or if you\u2019re dehydrated.Tylenol (Acetaminophen): Generally safe at your dosage, but avoid exceeding 3,000 mg/day to prevent liver damage.Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine): A muscle relaxant that can cause drowsiness or dizziness, which might contribute to your fatigue or eye symptoms.Mirtazapine: This antidepressant can cause drowsiness and may take time to fully address your grief/depression. It\u2019s good that your sleep seizures have resolved, but monitor for any new or worsening symptoms.Next Steps: Review your medications with your doctor to ensure they\u2019re not contributing to your symptoms. Blood levels of Epitol might be worth checking to ensure they\u2019re in the therapeutic range.4. Sleep and FatiguePoor sleep can exacerbate almost all of your conditions, including migraines, epilepsy, and depression. The nystagmus upon waking could be a sign of severe fatigue or a sleep disorder.Next Steps: Consider a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. Improving sleep quality might help reduce your symptoms.5. Grief and DepressionLosing both parents in a short time is incredibly difficult, and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re addressing the emotional impact with Mirtazapine and, hopefully, therapy or support groups.Next Steps: Continue working with your mental health provider to manage your grief and depression, as these can significantly impact your physical health.SummaryYour eye shaking upon waking could be related to fatigue, medication side effects, or an underlying neurological issue. Given your complex medical history, it\u2019s important to:Discuss this symptom with your neurologist.Ensure your medications are optimized.Consider a sleep study to address potential sleep disorders.Seek clarity on the MS diagnosis if it\u2019s still uncertain.Take care, and don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself with your healthcare team."

        "question": "Bipolar, OCD, TL Epilepsy (I am questioning this, diagnosed with absence seizures but I don\u2019t think this fits) 200mg Topamax 2x daily, 200mg sertraline, 3mg risperidone, 30mg abilify, 1000IU vitamin D, 40mg somac, I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was around 17-18, but my neurologist just doesn\u2019t really listen to me. He diagnosed me with absence seizures but the problem is I\u2019ve never forgotten a seizure or lost consciousness. Now I\u2019m realising that what he\u2019s called my \u2018motor tics\u2019 could be seizures as well. Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I\u2019m off my meds. But the past week I haven\u2019t really been sleeping and I\u2019ve had the flu and I\u2019ve been unable to twitch and it\u2019s like the feeling is building up in the back of my head and its getting really uncomfortable and making it sometimes hard to breathe. Sometimes painful. The feeling is completely involuntary, kind of like a sneeze, and it feels like when you can\u2019t sneeze. What should I do? My neurologist doesn\u2019t listen to me. I have a GP appointment in 2 days, should I talk to her about it?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general guidance based on what you've shared. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex situation, and it's important to address your concerns with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Here are some steps you might consider:Talk to Your GP: Since you have an appointment with your GP in two days, it\u2019s a good idea to bring up your concerns. Be as specific as possible about your symptoms, including the head jerks, the sensation in your head, the difficulty breathing, and how these symptoms have been worsening. Mention that your neurologist hasn\u2019t been responsive and that you\u2019re questioning your epilepsy diagnosis.Keep a Symptom Diary: Document your symptoms in detail, including when they occur, how long they last, any triggers (like lack of sleep or stress), and how they affect you. This can help your GP or neurologist better understand your condition.Seek a Second Opinion: If your current neurologist isn\u2019t listening to you or addressing your concerns, it might be worth seeking a second opinion from another neurologist, preferably one who specializes in epilepsy or movement disorders. They may be able to provide a fresh perspective or suggest further testing.Discuss Your Medications: Your current medications (Topamax, sertraline, risperidone, Abilify) could be influencing your symptoms or interacting in ways that need to be reviewed. Bring this up with your GP or a neurologist to ensure your treatment plan is appropriate for your symptoms.Consider Further Testing: If your symptoms don\u2019t align with absence seizures, other types of seizures or neurological conditions (e.g., focal seizures, myoclonus, or tic disorders) might need to be explored. Tests like an EEG, MRI, or video monitoring could provide more clarity.Address Sleep and Stress: Lack of sleep and illness (like the flu) can exacerbate neurological symptoms. Make sure to prioritize rest and recovery, and discuss any sleep issues with your GP.Advocate for Yourself: It\u2019s important to feel heard and understood by your healthcare providers. If you feel dismissed, don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself or bring someone with you to appointments to help communicate your concerns.Your symptoms\u2014such as the involuntary head jerks, the sensation of electricity, and the difficulty breathing\u2014could be related to a variety of neurological or psychiatric conditions. A thorough evaluation is essential to ensure you\u2019re getting the right diagnosis and treatment. Your GP can help guide you toward the next steps, including referrals to specialists if needed."

Using my voice is exhausting, too.I have diabetes, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, digestive stuff and as of new, undiagnosed liver problems. Have an electromyography and heart tests coming.I can't stay sitting. I need to lie down all the time.Had an overdose couple days ago, if that matters.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. What you're describing sounds incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s important to take your symptoms seriously. Given your complex medical history and recent overdose, it\u2019s crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you haven\u2019t already. Here\u2019s why:Key Concerns:Severe Fatigue and Weakness:Your exhaustion, pain, and inability to stay upright could be related to multiple factors, including:Diabetes management: Poor blood sugar control (high or low) can cause extreme fatigue and weakness.Multiple sclerosis (MS) flare: MS can cause profound fatigue, muscle weakness, and pain.Liver issues: Undiagnosed liver problems can lead to fatigue, malaise, and systemic symptoms.Medication side effects: Jardiance (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and insulin can sometimes cause fatigue or electrolyte imbalances, especially if your blood sugar is fluctuating.Overdose: Depending on what was involved, this could have lingering effects on your body, including your liver, kidneys, or nervous system.Body Pain and Weakness:This could be related to MS, but it could also indicate other issues like:Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., low potassium or sodium).Infections or inflammation (e.g., from liver issues or other systemic problems).Neurological complications from MS, epilepsy, or other conditions.Recent Overdose:This is a major red flag. Depending on what you took, it could have caused damage to your liver, kidneys, or other organs. It could also be contributing to your current symptoms.Liver Problems:Undiagnosed liver issues can cause fatigue, pain, and systemic symptoms. Liver dysfunction can also affect how your body processes medications, which could worsen side effects or toxicity.What You Should Do:Seek Immediate Medical Care:Go to the emergency room or contact your doctor right away. Explain your symptoms, recent overdose, and all your medical conditions. They may need to run tests to check your liver, kidneys, electrolytes, blood sugar, and more.Mention Your Medications:Jardiance, insulin, and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) can all have side effects or interactions that might contribute to your symptoms. Your doctor may need to adjust your medications.Monitor Your Blood Sugar:If you\u2019re not already tracking your blood sugar closely, start now. High or low blood sugar can cause severe fatigue and weakness.Prepare for Your Upcoming Tests:The electromyography (EMG) and heart tests are important. Make sure your doctors know about your current symptoms so they can interpret the results in context.Consider Mental Health Support:Living with multiple chronic conditions is incredibly challenging, and the recent overdose suggests you might be struggling emotionally. Please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support.Possible Next Steps:Blood tests: To check liver function, kidney function, electrolytes, blood sugar, and more.Imaging: If your liver issues are undiagnosed, an ultrasound or MRI might be needed.Medication review: To ensure your current medications aren\u2019t contributing to your symptoms.Hospitalization: If your symptoms are severe, you might need to be monitored in a hospital setting.Final Note:Your symptoms are serious and could be caused by a combination of your medical conditions, medications, or recent overdose. Please don\u2019t wait to get help. You deserve care and support to feel better. Let me know if you need help finding resources or preparing for your doctor\u2019s visit."

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse. So uh\u2026 yeah.Thoughts? Feelings? I briefly caught part of it on video, but have no idea how to post that here.I greatly appreciate any input.",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your distressing experience, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re seeking clarity. While I\u2019m not a medical professional, I can offer some thoughts based on the information you\u2019ve provided. Your symptoms\u2014eye fluttering, out-of-body sensations, limb spasms, tingling, facial twitching, and speech difficulties\u2014are concerning and warrant thorough investigation. Here are some key points to consider:1. Neurological SymptomsYour symptoms could potentially point to a neurological issue, such as:Focal seizures: These can present in many ways, including sensory, motor, or autonomic symptoms, and may not always show up on an EEG, especially if the seizure activity is deep in the brain.Dysfunction in the brainstem or cervical spine: Given the location of your pain (top of the spine/base of the skull) and the involvement of your eye, face, and limbs, this area could be relevant.Vascular issues: Problems with blood flow to the brain (e.g., transient ischemic attacks or vertebral artery issues) could cause similar symptoms.Functional neurological disorder (FND): While the neurologist suggested a psychogenic cause, this diagnosis should only be made after ruling out other possibilities.2. EEG LimitationsA normal EEG does not completely rule out seizures, especially if the seizure activity originates in a deep or localized area of the brain that the EEG cannot detect. Prolonged EEG monitoring or imaging studies (e.g., MRI) might be necessary.3. Next StepsAdvocate for further testing: Request a brain MRI to rule out structural abnormalities, lesions, or vascular issues. If the MRI is normal, consider asking for a lumbar puncture to check for autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, autoimmune encephalitis).Consult a specialist: If possible, seek a second opinion from a neurologist who specializes in seizures, movement disorders, or autoimmune neurology.Document your symptoms: Keep a detailed log of your episodes, including triggers, duration, and symptoms. Share the video you recorded with your doctors.Consider autonomic testing: If your symptoms involve near-syncope or out-of-body sensations, autonomic dysfunction (e.g., POTS or dysautonomia) could be a possibility.4. Psychogenic vs. Organic CausesWhile psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are a valid diagnosis, they should not be assumed without thorough investigation. The neurologist\u2019s dismissal of your symptoms as purely psychological without further testing is concerning. If anxiety or stress are contributing factors, they should still be addressed, but only after ruling out other causes.5. Immediate ConcernsIf your symptoms worsen or you experience new symptoms (e.g., severe headache, weakness, confusion, or vision changes), seek immediate medical attention. These could indicate a more urgent condition.6. AdvocacyIt\u2019s frustrating to feel dismissed by a healthcare provider. Be persistent in advocating for yourself. If you feel your concerns are not being taken seriously, consider seeking care at a larger hospital or academic medical center with more specialized resources.Final ThoughtsYour symptoms are complex and could have multiple potential causes. While the neurologist\u2019s initial assessment may have been dismissive, it\u2019s important to continue pursuing answers. A thorough workup, including imaging and possibly further testing, is essential to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment.If you\u2019re able, share the video with your daytime doctor or a new specialist. In the meantime, take care of yourself and try to document any further episodes in detail. Wishing you the best as you navigate this challenging situation."

        "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand what could be going on with your son. It\u2019s important to follow up with your neurologist or pediatrician for a proper evaluation, as they can assess his symptoms in the context of his medical history.Tremors and Developmental Concerns: Tremors in infants and children can have various causes, ranging from benign (like essential tremor) to more concerning neurological conditions. If the tremors have persisted or changed in nature, it\u2019s worth revisiting with the neurologist to rule out underlying issues.Closing Eyes and Shaking Head: The behavior you\u2019re describing\u2014closing his eyes and shaking his head\u2014could have several explanations:Sensory Processing: Some children engage in repetitive movements as a way to self-soothe or process sensory input. This could be related to sensory processing differences.Tics or Habitual Movements: These could be involuntary movements (tics) or habitual behaviors that are not necessarily harmful but should be monitored.Teething or Discomfort: While teething typically causes gum irritation, drooling, and fussiness, it\u2019s less likely to cause head shaking or eye closing. However, discomfort from teething might lead to unusual behaviors.Possible Seizure Activity: Although his previous EEG did not show epileptic activity, seizure types can vary widely. Some seizures (e.g., absence seizures or focal seizures) might not always show up on a short EEG. If these episodes are new or worsening, it\u2019s worth discussing with the neurologist.Next Steps:Keep a Symptom Diary: Record when these episodes occur, how long they last, and any triggers or patterns you notice. This can help the neurologist assess whether further testing is needed.Follow Up with the Neurologist: Share your observations and concerns. They may recommend a longer EEG (e.g., a 24-hour study) or other tests to rule out seizure activity or other neurological conditions.Rule Out Other Causes: Ensure there are no other contributing factors, such as vision problems, ear infections, or other sources of discomfort.It\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about your son\u2019s health. Trust your instincts as a parent, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek further clarification or testing if something feels off. Early intervention and thorough evaluation can make a big difference in understanding and managing his symptoms."

        "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information about EEG findings and what they might indicate. However, it\u2019s important to emphasize that only a qualified healthcare provider, such as an epilepsy specialist or neurologist, can accurately interpret your EEG results and correlate them with your symptoms and medical history.Key Points from Your EEG Report:Background Activity:The EEG shows moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable background activity around 10 cycles per second (c/s), which is within the alpha frequency range (normal for resting states).This activity is present in the posterior regions of the brain and spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas.There are slower waves interrupting this background activity, as well as some faster-frequency beta waves.The reactivity to opening and closing eyelids is incomplete, which might suggest some irregularity in how your brain responds to stimuli.Frontal Low Voltage Activity:There is low voltage activity in the frontal region (specifically F3), which could indicate reduced electrical activity in that area.Dysrhythmias and Sharp Wave Complexes:The EEG mentions discontinuous dysrhythmias (irregular brain rhythms) in the left temporal, mid-frontotemporal, and frontal regions, with a maximum at T3-F7 and F3-FP1.There are also isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes in these areas. Sharp waves can sometimes be associated with epileptiform activity, but they are not definitive proof of epilepsy on their own.Hyperventilation and Flickering Light:Hyperventilation slightly activated the regional changes described, which is a common response in some EEG abnormalities.No activation signs were seen under flickering light (photic stimulation), which is generally a good sign, as photic stimulation can sometimes trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.Possible Implications:The findings suggest some irregular electrical activity in your brain, particularly in the left temporal and frontal regions. These areas are often associated with certain types of epilepsy or other neurological conditions.The presence of sharp wave complexes and dysrhythmias could indicate a predisposition to seizures or other paroxysmal (episodic) neurological events. However, these findings are not conclusive for epilepsy without clinical correlation (e.g., your symptoms and medical history).Your symptoms (episodic fatigue, disorientation, trembling, and a weird feeling) could potentially be related to these EEG findings, but they could also be caused by other conditions, such as migraines, sleep disorders, or metabolic issues.Next Steps:Consult the Epilepsy Specialist: The specialist will review your EEG, symptoms, and medical history to determine if epilepsy or another neurological condition is the cause. They may order additional tests, such as a prolonged EEG, MRI, or blood work, to gather more information.Keep a Symptom Diary: Document your episodes in detail, including triggers, duration, and any associated symptoms. This can help the specialist make a more accurate diagnosis.Avoid Jumping to Conclusions: While the EEG findings are concerning, they do not definitively diagnose epilepsy. Many people have abnormal EEGs without having seizures or epilepsy.Final Note:It\u2019s understandable to feel worried, but try to stay calm until you see the epilepsy specialist. EEGs can show abnormalities that are not necessarily linked to serious conditions, and your symptoms could have other explanations. The specialist will provide clarity and guide you toward the appropriate treatment if needed.Let me know if you have further questions or need support!"

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "**Summary and Recommendations for Medication Management:****1. Seizure Risk Assessment:**- **Wellbutrin (Bupropion):** At 150 mg daily, the seizure risk is low but present. The risk increases with doses \u2265450 mg/day.- **Trazodone:** Seizure risk is dose-dependent (rare at <300 mg/day).- **Adderall (Amphetamine):** May lower seizure threshold at high doses.- **Combined Effect:** While the combination theoretically increases seizure risk, your history of tolerance (6\u20137 years without issues) suggests stability. Klonopin\u2019s anti-convulsant properties may mitigate some risk.**Action:**- Maintain current doses unless symptoms (e.g., myoclonic jerks, confusion) arise.- Avoid alcohol/drugs that further lower seizure threshold (e.g., tramadol, high-dose caffeine).---**2. Cardiovascular Monitoring:**- **Adderall** can elevate HR/BP. Your HR (80\u2013120 bpm) may reflect stimulant effects, anxiety, or dehydration.- **Trazodone** rarely causes QT prolongation.**Action:**- Regular BP/HR checks (e.g., home monitor).- Consider ECG if palpitations or dizziness worsen to assess QT interval.---**3. Orthostatic Hypotension:**- Likely due to Trazodone\u2019s \u03b11-blockade + dehydration/stimulant-induced appetite suppression.**Action:**- Hydrate aggressively, increase salt intake, and rise slowly from sitting/lying positions.---**4. Insomnia Management:**- Trazodone + Klonopin PRN is effective but risks tolerance/dependence.**Action:**- Discuss non-pharmacological options (e.g., CBT-I) with your psychiatrist.- Consider alternatives like low-dose doxepin or mirtazapine if Trazodone loses efficacy.---**5. Polypharmacy & Alternatives:**- **ADHD:** If Adderall contributes to insomnia/anxiety, discuss non-stimulants (e.g., guanfacine, atomoxetine).- **Depression/GAD:** Wellbutrin\u2019s noradrenergic effects may exacerbate anxiety; alternatives like SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) could address both GAD and depression.---**6. Next Steps:**- **Consult Psychiatrist:** Revisit medication regimen, emphasizing seizure/cardiac concerns. Request a second opinion if uncertain.- **Lifestyle:** Prioritize sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and regular meals.- **Emergency Plan:** Seek immediate care for syncope, seizures, or chest pain.Your proactive approach and medical background are assets, but collaboration with your care team remains key.

        "question": "I have been diagnosed with Ped Mal seizures since I was young. It has been triggered at times due to various reasons however those reasons have never been gaming. I ran into a game that gave a warning for Photosensitive epilepsy for its intense flashing however I play many games that have intense flashing but haven't had a episode. I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering whether to play a game with a photosensitivity warning, even if you\u2019ve tolerated similar games without issues, it\u2019s important to proceed cautiously. Here\u2019s a structured summary of recommendations:### Key Considerations:1. **Medication Effectiveness**:- Lamotrigine (250mg) has kept you seizure-free, which is encouraging. However, no medication guarantees complete protection against all triggers, especially novel or intense stimuli.2. **Photosensitivity History**:- Your seizures were not previously triggered by gaming, but this game\u2019s specific flashing patterns (e.g., rapid frequencies between 5\u201330 Hz) might pose a unique risk. Photosensitivity varies widely\u2014some individuals react only to very specific stimuli.3. **Individual Variability**:- Past tolerance to similar games doesn\u2019t eliminate risk for this one. Warnings exist because the game meets criteria for potential triggers, which may differ from others you\u2019ve played.### Recommendations:- **Consult Your Neurologist**:- Share the game\u2019s warning and specifics (if available) with your doctor. They can evaluate your personal risk based on your seizure history, medication regimen, and the game\u2019s features.- **Precautionary Measures** (if you proceed):- **Environment**: Play in a well-lit room to reduce screen contrast.- **Screen Adjustments**: Use anti-glare filters, lower brightness, or enable \"safe mode\" (if the game offers one).- **Distance**: Sit farther from the screen.- **Breaks**: Take frequent pauses to avoid prolonged exposure.- **Monitor Symptoms**: Stop immediately if you experience unusual symptoms (e.g., dizziness, visual disturbances).- **Weight and Dosage**:- While your weight (290 lbs) might influence dosing, Lamotrigine efficacy is typically monitored through clinical response. Since you\u2019re seizure-free, your dose is likely appropriate, but your neurologist can confirm this.### Final Note:**Prioritize safety**\u2014even a small risk isn\u2019t worth taking without medical guidance. Your neurologist is best positioned to weigh the benefits vs. risks based on your unique history. If they approve, employ the precautions above to minimize potential triggers."

        "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \\\"blanking out\\\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you describe\u2014brief \"blanking out\" spells with unresponsiveness, followed by arm/neck twitching\u2014**warrant urgent medical evaluation**, particularly given your family history and triggers (alcohol, sleep deprivation). Here\u2019s a structured breakdown:---### **Key Considerations**1. **Possible Epilepsy**:- **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures**: Staring spells with reduced awareness (but not complete loss of consciousness) and motor symptoms (twitching) align with this type. These can evolve into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures if untreated.- **Triggers**: Alcohol (lowers seizure threshold) and poor sleep (a known seizure precipitant) strongly support this possibility.- **Family History**: Your cousin\u2019s grand mal seizures suggest a potential genetic predisposition.2. **Differential Diagnoses**:- **Non-Epileptic Events** (e.g., stress-related or functional seizures).- **Exacerbated Motor Tics**: Unlikely, as tics typically don\u2019t involve unresponsiveness.- **Syncope or Cardiac Issues**: Less likely given retained awareness, but still worth ruling out.---### **Urgent Next Steps**1. **Consult a Neurologist**: Specialized evaluation is critical. Request:- **EEG** (preferably prolonged or sleep-deprived) to detect abnormal brain activity.- **MRI** to rule out structural brain abnormalities.- **Detailed history review**, including substance use and family patterns.2. **Immediate Adjustments**:- **Avoid Alcohol**: It directly increases seizure risk, especially given your cousin\u2019s history.- **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene**: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule.- **Safety Precautions**: Avoid driving, swimming, or heights until evaluated.---### **Why This Matters**- **Progression Risk**: Untreated seizures may worsen in frequency/severity.- **ASD Considerations**: While ASD itself isn\u2019t linked to epilepsy, some studies suggest a higher comorbidity rate; ensure providers are aware of your diagnosis.---### **Final Note**You\u2019re **not overthinking**. These symptoms, combined with your family history, are concerning. Early diagnosis and intervention are key to managing potential epilepsy and preventing complications. Schedule a neurology appointment **immediately** and avoid triggers in the meantime."

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "answer": "It\u2019s important to approach your symptoms with both urgency and compassion. Here\u2019s a structured breakdown of considerations and next steps:---### **Key Considerations**1. **Seizure Risk from Bupropion**- Bupropion (Wellbutrin) lowers the seizure threshold, especially at doses \u2265400 mg/day. While your dose (400 mg) is within the FDA limit, combined with marijuana use (which can also lower the threshold), this increases your risk. Sudden emotional shifts, sensory disturbances, and post-episode confusion align with **focal seizures**.2. **Migraine vs. Seizure**- Migraine auras can mimic seizures but typically last longer (minutes to hours). Your brief \u201celectric shock\u201d sensation and repetitive thoughts (e.g., Lincoln logs) are more suggestive of **temporal lobe focal seizures**. However, migraine variants (e.g., \u201csilent\u201d or brainstem aura migraines) should still be ruled out.3. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**- Your girlfriend\u2019s PNES history and your anxiety/depression raise this possibility. PNES often co-occurs with psychiatric conditions but requires video EEG confirmation. Your self-doubt (\u201cmaking it up\u201d) is common in both PNES and epilepsy but should not delay evaluation.4. **Medication Interactions**- Bupropion + Buspirone: Low serotonin syndrome risk, but monitor for agitation/tremors.- Hydroxyzine: Can cause drowsiness/dizziness, worsening dissociation.- Glycopyrrolate: May contribute to dehydration, exacerbating dizziness.- Marijuana: THC can trigger anxiety, derealization, or (rarely) seizures.5. **Other Medical Issues**- Unexplained weight loss, exercise intolerance, and dizziness warrant screening for thyroid dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, or metabolic disorders.---### **Urgent Next Steps**1. **See a Neurologist ASAP**- Request an **EEG** (preferably during an episode) and **brain MRI** to rule out structural causes.- Describe your episodes in detail, including triggers (food, fatigue), auras (nausea, anger), and postictal symptoms (confusion, tiredness).2. **Revisit Medications**- Discuss bupropion\u2019s seizure risk with your prescriber. A dose reduction or switch to a lower-risk antidepressant (e.g., SSRIs) may be warranted.- Track episodes in relation to medication timing, meals, and marijuana use.3. **Rule Out Mimics**- Bloodwork: Thyroid panel, electrolytes, glucose, liver/kidney function.- Cardiac evaluation: ECG or Holter monitor for arrhythmias (e.g., SVT).4. **Safety Precautions**- Avoid driving, swimming, or heights until evaluated.- Stay hydrated and monitor for hypoglycemia (especially after sugary/fatty meals).5. **Mental Health Support**- Address self-blame/guilt. Symptoms are real, whether neurological or psychogenic. Therapy (e.g., CBT) can help manage anxiety and coping.---### **Reassurance**- **You are not \u201cfaking\u201d it.** Even if symptoms are stress-related (e.g., PNES), they require validation and care.- **Patterns matter:** Triggers like food, fatigue, and the recurring \u201cpre-episode\u201d feelings (nausea, droopy eyelids) are critical clues for your doctor.---### **Questions to Prepare for Your Doctor**- How long after eating do episodes occur? (Delayed vs. rapid onset suggests different triggers.)- Do you lose awareness or just feel \u201cstuck\u201d in your thoughts?- Any family history of seizures or migraines?Prioritize a neurology appointment immediately. Your symptoms are serious but manageable with the right diagnosis. \ud83d\udc9b"

        "answer": "Navigating Episodic Ataxia Type 2 (EA2) and treatment challenges requires a strategic approach. Here's a structured plan to address your concerns and goals:### 1. **Understanding Your Current Medications**- **Diamox (Acetazolamide):** A standard EA2 treatment; discuss optimizing dosage with your neurologist if symptoms persist.- **Prednisone:** Effective for you but carries risks (e.g., osteoporosis, diabetes). Tapering must be gradual and supervised to avoid adrenal insufficiency.### 2. **Exploring 4-AP (Fampridine)**- **Mechanism:** Potassium channel blocker shown to reduce EA2 attack frequency in studies (off-label use).- **Steps to Access:**- **Discuss with Neurologist:** Share research on 4-AP for EA2 (e.g., [Strupp et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0b013e31820ce5e3)) and ask for a trial. Inquire about their reservations.- **Insurance Hurdles:** If prescribed, work with your doctor to submit prior authorization (PA). Highlight its use in EA2 and lack of alternatives.- **Specialist Referral:** Seek a neurologist specializing in movement disorders or ataxia (via telemedicine if local options are limited).### 3. **Overcoming Barriers to Care**- **Movement Clinic Alternatives:**- Check if your insurance covers telemedicine specialists (e.g., universities like Johns Hopkins or Mayo Clinic).- Contact the clinic to explore payment plans, sliding scales, or PA assistance.- **Second Opinion:** If your neurologist remains unresponsive, seek another opinion. Organizations like the [National Ataxia Foundation](https://www.ataxia.org) can provide referrals.### 4. **Prednisone Tapering Plan**- Collaborate with your doctor to create a gradual taper schedule. Do not stop abruptly.- Monitor for adrenal insufficiency symptoms (fatigue, dizziness).### 5. **Advocacy and Communication**- Prepare a concise summary of your symptoms, treatment response, and interest in 4-AP for discussions with providers.- Ask specific questions: \u201cWhat are your concerns about 4-AP?\u201d or \u201cCan we trial it while tapering prednisone?\u201d### 6. **Non-Pharmacological Strategies**- Identify triggers (stress, caffeine, lack of sleep) and mitigate them.- Consider physical therapy for balance and coordination.### 7. **Insurance and Financial Assistance**- Contact your insurance to clarify coverage for 4-AP and specialist visits.- Explore patient assistance programs (e.g., [PAN Foundation](https://panfoundation.org)) for medication costs.### 8. **Safety and Monitoring**- If starting 4-AP, monitor for side effects (seizures, insomnia) and efficacy.- Regular follow-ups to adjust treatment as needed.### Key Takeaways:- Persist in advocating for 4-AP with your current neurologist or seek a specialist.- Prioritize safe prednisone tapering.- Leverage telemedicine and advocacy groups to bypass local barriers.By addressing these steps systematically, you can work toward transitioning to a safer, effective treatment plan while managing EA2 symptoms."

        "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ?

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The experience you described could be attributed to a combination of factors related to sleep-wake transitions, anxiety, and neurological processes. Here's a breakdown of potential explanations and recommendations:### Possible Explanations:1. **Hypnopompic State**:- **Context**: The transitional state between sleep and wakefulness (hypnopompic) can cause confusion, fragmented thoughts, or sensory distortions. Your brain might not have fully \"booted up,\" leading to disorientation and impaired cognition.- **Symptoms**: Inability to form complex thoughts, fleeting thoughts (\"writing on burning paper\"), and emotional detachment align with this state.2. **Nocturnal Panic Attack**:- **Triggers**: Sudden awakening can trigger a panic response, especially if you\u2019re prone to anxiety. The instinctual fear of losing control, derealization (feeling detached from reality), and emotional flooding (crying) are hallmark signs.- **Physical Response**: Fight-or-flight adrenaline surges can amplify physical sensations and disrupt rational thinking.3. **Dissociative Episode**:- **Features**: Feelings of thoughts being \"not yours,\" chaos, and grounding efforts (e.g., recalling memories) suggest dissociation, often linked to stress or trauma.4. **Sleep Deprivation/Disorders**:- **Chronic Interruptions**: Frequent 4 a.m. awakenings may indicate disrupted sleep architecture (e.g., insomnia, sleep apnea), exacerbating cognitive dysfunction and emotional volatility.### Recommendations:1. **Medical Consultation**:- Rule out neurological or physiological causes (e.g., sleep apnea, migraines) with a healthcare provider. A sleep study might be beneficial.2. **Stress and Anxiety Management**:- Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation to mitigate panic responses.- Consider therapy (e.g., CBT) to address underlying anxiety or dissociation.3. **Sleep Hygiene**:- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens before bed, and create a calming pre-sleep routine.- Limit caffeine/alcohol, especially in the evening.4. **Grounding Techniques**:- Use sensory grounding (e.g., holding a cold object, focusing on your breath) during episodes to reconnect with reality.5. **Monitor Recurrence**:- Track episodes in a journal, noting triggers, duration, and symptoms. Share this with a professional if they persist.### Final Thoughts:While this episode was likely a one-time occurrence linked to sleep transitions and anxiety, recurrent episodes warrant further evaluation. Prioritize self-care and seek support to address potential stressors or sleep disruptions. You\u2019re not alone\u2014many people experience similar phenomena, and help is available to manage them."

        "answer": "The symptoms described suggest a complex interplay of sleep disorders, mental health conditions, and lifestyle factors. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### **Key Symptoms & Possible Conditions**1. **Nocturia (2-4x/night):**- Could be due to disrupted sleep (e.g., waking from sleep disorders leading to awareness of bladder pressure).- Rule out medical causes (diabetes, UTI, overactive bladder) with blood/urine tests.2. **Sleep Paralysis & Hypnagogic Hallucinations:**- Classic signs of **narcolepsy type 1 or 2** (if cataplexy is absent).- Exploding head syndrome (a parasomnia) often co-occurs with sleep paralysis and is linked to stress/sleep disruption.3. **Fatigue, Anxiety, & Memory Issues:**- Chronic sleep fragmentation impairs cognition and exacerbates mental health symptoms.- Memory loss may stem from poor sleep quality rather than epilepsy, though neurological evaluation is prudent.4. **Depression/Anxiety:**- Bidirectional relationship with sleep disorders; poor sleep worsens mood, and mental health issues disrupt sleep.### **Differential Diagnoses to Consider**- **Narcolepsy:** Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and potential daytime fatigue align with this.- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Despite normal BMI, evaluate for subtle signs (e.g., snoring, gasping).- **Idiopathic Hypersomnia:** Excessive sleepiness without cataplexy.- **Parasomnias:** Exploding head syndrome and sleep paralysis fall under this category.- **Epilepsy:** Less likely given lack of classic seizure features, but an EEG could rule out nocturnal seizures.### **Recommendations for Evaluation**1. **Sleep Studies:**- **Polysomnogram (PSG):** Assess for OSA, nocturnal seizures, or REM abnormalities.- **Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT):** Confirm narcolepsy if PSG shows normal sleep architecture.2. **Medical Workup:**- Blood tests: Check glucose, thyroid function, electrolytes.- Urinalysis: Rule out infection or diabetes-related issues.3. **Neurological Consultation:**- EEG to evaluate for epilepsy (though symptoms lean toward sleep disorders).4. **Mental Health Review:**- Optimize treatment for depression/anxiety (e.g., CBT, medication adjustment if needed).### **Lifestyle & Symptomatic Management**- **Sleep Hygiene:**- Consistent sleep schedule, avoid alcohol/smoking near bedtime, limit fluids before bed.- Sleep position (side-sleeping may reduce sleep paralysis).- **Medication Review:**- Discuss Zyrtec timing/side effects with a doctor; consider alternatives if contributing to disruptions.- **Behavioral Strategies:**- Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).- Stress reduction techniques (mindfulness, yoga).### **Potential Treatments**- **Narcolepsy:** Stimulants (modafinil), sodium oxybate, or SSRIs/SNRIs for cataplexy.- **Sleep Paralysis:** Reassurance, improving sleep consistency, and addressing triggers (stress, irregular schedules).- **Exploding Head Syndrome:** Often self-limiting; clonazepam or calcium channel blockers in severe cases.### **Urgent Considerations**- Prioritize a **sleep specialist consultation** to clarify the diagnosis.- Address mental health with a psychiatrist/therapist to break the cycle of poor sleep and mood symptoms.This multifaceted approach aims to improve sleep quality, reduce nocturnal symptoms, and enhance overall well-being. Early intervention is critical given the decade-long duration of symptoms."

        "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When transitioning from Tegretol (carbamazepine) to Keppra (levetiracetam) and Topamax (topiramate), your blood monitoring needs shift due to differences in how these drugs are metabolized. Here's a structured breakdown of what to expect:### **1. Renal Function Monitoring**- **Why?** Keppra and Topamax are primarily cleared by the kidneys. Regular **renal panels** (creatinine, BUN, electrolytes) will likely be added to assess kidney function and detect issues like metabolic acidosis (a rare side effect of Topamax).- **Frequency:** Initially periodic, then adjusted based on stability.### **2. Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**- **Possibility:** While LFTs were critical for Tegretol, they may still be checked occasionally to ensure recovery from prior liver stress, even though Keppra/Topamax are not hepatotoxic. If your liver enzymes normalized post-Tegretol, LFTs might eventually phase out.### **3. Complete Blood Count (CBC)**- **Continued Need:** Keppra can rarely affect blood cells (e.g., leukopenia), so CBCs may persist to monitor for anemia, infections, or platelet issues.### **4. Therapeutic Drug Levels**- **Unlikely Routine:** Unlike Tegretol, Keppra/Topamax levels aren\u2019t routinely monitored unless toxicity or compliance is suspected. Your doctors may discontinue these unless specific concerns arise.### **5. Additional Considerations**- **Transition Phase:** Your team might temporarily overlap LFTs and renal tests to ensure safety during the switch.- **Individual Factors:** Pre-existing conditions or lingering liver concerns could justify ongoing LFTs.### **What to Ask Your Care Team**- Clarify if LFTs are still needed long-term.- Confirm the frequency of renal panels/CBCs.- Discuss whether drug level testing is planned.### **Summary**Expect **renal panels and CBCs** as staples, with **LFTs potentially reduced** if your liver recovers. Your doctors are likely prioritizing kidney health while cautiously monitoring past liver issues. Open dialogue with your care team will help tailor this plan to your needs."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptom you're experiencing\u2014recurrent left eye closure\u2014warrants prompt medical evaluation. Here's a structured approach to address your concerns:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Possible Causes:**- **Seizure Activity:** Focal motor seizures (affecting eyelid muscles) or myoclonic jerks, though temporal lobe epilepsy typically involves altered awareness. Video EEG monitoring could clarify if episodes correlate with epileptiform activity.- **Medication Side Effects:**- **Antipsychotics (Risperidone, Aripiprazole):** Risk of dystonia, blepharospasm, or other movement disorders.- **Topiramate:** Rarely linked to eye movement disorders.- **Primary Blepharospasm:** Idiopathic or secondary to dry eyes, stress, or neurological conditions.- **Hemifacial Spasm:** Involuntary contractions of facial muscles, often due to nerve irritation.2. **Urgency:**- While not an emergency, persistent symptoms require evaluation to rule out serious causes (e.g., seizure progression, medication toxicity).### **Recommended Actions:**1. **Consult Your Neurologist:**- They can assess whether this is a new seizure type, review medications, and consider an EEG (ideally during an episode).- Mention any triggers, associated symptoms (e.g., twitching elsewhere, aura, loss of awareness), and timing relative to medication doses.2. **Medication Review:**- Discuss potential drug interactions or side effects (e.g., combining two antipsychotics may increase dystonia risk). Dose adjustments or alternatives (e.g., clonazepam for blepharospasm) may be explored.3. **Track Symptoms:**- Keep a log of episodes (frequency, duration, triggers) to aid diagnosis.4. **Rule Out Ocular Causes:**- An ophthalmologist can assess for dry eyes, irritation, or structural issues contributing to eyelid spasms.### **Conclusion:**Prioritize a neurologist visit given your epilepsy history and complex medication regimen. They are best positioned to differentiate between seizure-related activity, medication effects, or primary movement disorders. If access is delayed, consult your GP for interim guidance and referral. Do not adjust medications without professional advice.**Next Steps:** Schedule a neurology appointment promptly and document your symptoms in detail."

        "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your son's situation. Infantile spasms are indeed a medical emergency, and your urgency to seek timely evaluation is understandable. Here's a concise breakdown of your concerns and recommendations:### 1. **Infantile Spasms & West Syndrome:**- **Urgency of Treatment:** Early intervention (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], steroids, or vigabatrin) improves outcomes. Delays in diagnosis/treatment can worsen developmental risks.- **EEG Timing:** While expediting the EEG is reasonable, ensure coordination with your Canadian care team to avoid gaps in follow-up care. Some U.S. pediatric neurology centers may offer urgent EEGs (e.g., children\u2019s hospitals), but costs can be high.### 2. **Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) & Genetic Testing:**- **TS and West Syndrome Link:** Up to 30% of infantile spasms cases are TS-related. TS is caused by mutations in *TSC1* or *TSC2* genes.- **23andMe Limitations:**- **No:** 23andMe does **not** test for *TSC1/TSC2* mutations. It focuses on common SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for ancestry and limited health traits (e.g., BRCA1/2 variants), not comprehensive gene sequencing.- **Clinical Testing Required:** TS diagnosis requires **clinical genetic testing** (whole-exome sequencing or targeted *TSC1/TSC2* analysis) ordered by a physician. This detects deletions, duplications, and point mutations.- **Diagnostic Clues:** TS may present with hypopigmented \"ash-leaf\" spots (visible under UV light), cardiac rhabdomyomas, or cortical tubers (seen on MRI, not ultrasound). Even if absent now, ongoing monitoring is critical.### 3. **Next Steps:**- **Immediate:** Prioritize the EEG and consult a pediatric neurologist. If traveling to the U.S., contact pediatric centers in advance (e.g., Boston Children\u2019s, CHOP, Seattle Children\u2019s) to confirm availability.- **Genetic Testing:** Request a referral for clinical TS genetic testing (via blood or saliva) and a brain MRI if the EEG suggests hypsarrhythmia (West syndrome hallmark).- **Vigabatrin Consideration:** If TS is suspected, vigabatrin is first-line treatment and may be started empirically while awaiting test results.### 4. **Resources:**- **TS Alliance:** [www.tsalliance.org](https://www.tsalliance.org) (guidance on TS and specialist referrals).- **Infantile Spasms Project:** [infantilespasms.org](https://infantilespasms.org) (educational videos for caregivers/providers).Your proactive approach is commendable. Work closely with a pediatric neurologist to navigate testing and treatment swiftly. Wishing your family strength during this stressful time."

        "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you describe, occurring cyclically with your menstrual period, suggest a possible link to hormonal fluctuations. While catamenial epilepsy is a consideration, several other conditions should also be explored. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### Key Considerations:1. **Catamenial Epilepsy**:- **Relevance**: Seizures tied to menstrual cycles due to hormonal changes (estrogen/progesterone). Symptoms like confusion, loss of consciousness, and post-episode amnesia (e.g., groaning/mumbling) could align with seizures.- **Caveats**: Breathing interruptions (apnea) are less typical. Ativan\u2019s effectiveness may support this, as benzodiazepines treat seizures.2. **Hormonal Migraine with Aura**:- **Relevance**: Migraines triggered by hormonal shifts can cause sensory disturbances (e.g., \"waves\" in the head), tingling, and autonomic symptoms. NSAIDs (ibuprofen) often help by reducing prostaglandins.- **Caveats**: Loss of consciousness is rare but possible in severe cases.3. **Autonomic Dysfunction (e.g., POTS)**:- **Relevance**: Menstrual cycles can exacerbate dysautonomia, leading to tachycardia, presyncope, and tingling. Breathing difficulties may stem from autonomic instability.- **Caveats**: Less likely to explain amnesia or abrupt symptom resolution with Ativan.4. **Panic/Anxiety Disorders**:- **Relevance**: Hormonal changes can worsen anxiety. Hyperventilation may cause tingling, dizziness, or fainting.- **Caveats**: Panic attacks rarely cause prolonged unconsciousness or cyclical patterns without psychological triggers.5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**:- **Relevance**: Vomiting (past episodes) could disrupt electrolytes, causing muscle/nerve symptoms. Hormonal shifts may also affect fluid balance.- **Caveats**: Less likely this time, as vomiting was absent.### Recommendations:- **Neurological Evaluation**:- **EEG (preferably during symptoms)**: To detect epileptiform activity.- **MRI**: Rule out structural causes.- **Ambulatory Monitoring**: Capture cardiac/neurological data during episodes.- **Hormonal/Gynecological Assessment**:- Track symptoms relative to menstrual phases.- Consider hormonal therapies (e.g., progesterone) to stabilize fluctuations.- **Autonomic Testing**:- Tilt-table test for POTS/dysautonomia.- **Emergency Care Plan**:- Discuss a tailored approach with providers (e.g., preemptive Ativan during high-risk cycle phases).- **Lifestyle/Prophylaxis**:- Continue NSAIDs preemptively if effective.- Monitor electrolytes and hydration, especially around menstruation.### Conclusion:While catamenial epilepsy is possible, a comprehensive workup is essential to rule out migraines, dysautonomia, or other neurological conditions. Prioritize a neurologist consultation and cycle symptom tracking. Immediate attention is warranted if breathing issues or loss of consciousness recur."

I could feel a very tender lump right where the occipital lymph node is (thanks google!) I did palpate it a lot, and it is extremely painful today. I was also up all night with an awful migraine (first one in months since I started Aimovig) and it spread to my entire head and it was 8/10 pain. I do not have a fever. My headache is better when upright and has gotten a bit better throughout the day but the very painful bulge is still there. It also hurts at rest in that area.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the presented information, here's a structured summary and recommendations:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Occipital Lymphadenopathy:**- Likely due to a localized infection (e.g., bacterial lymphadenitis) from a nearby source such as an infected scalp lesion, cystic acne, or an unnoticed skin injury. The tenderness and acute onset suggest infection, even without fever.- Alternative: An infected sebaceous cyst/abscess in the occipital area.2. **Migraine Exacerbation:**- The severe migraine could be triggered by stress, infection, or a new medication interaction (e.g., Aptiom). Aimovig\u2019s effectiveness might be challenged by these triggers.3. **Musculoskeletal Pain:**- Right shoulder/neck strain from lifting may contribute to cervicogenic headache and localized pain, though it may be coincidental to the lymphadenopathy.4. **Medication Review:**- Aptiom (started recently) and Aimovig are less likely direct causes but warrant monitoring for rare hypersensitivity reactions.### **Red Flags to Monitor:**- **Meningitis Concerns:** No fever or classic meningeal signs, but neck pain/headache warrants caution.- **Abscess Formation:** Fluctuance, warmth, or redness at the lump site suggests need for drainage.- **Systemic Infection:** Lethargy without fever could still indicate a localized or early systemic infection.### **Recommendations:**1. **Seek Immediate Medical Evaluation:**- Physical exam to assess lymph node characteristics (size, mobility, fluctuance) and possible sources of infection (e.g., scalp, cystic acne).- Evaluate for meningeal signs (stiff neck, photophobia) despite low suspicion.2. **Diagnostic Tests:**- **Blood Work:** CBC, CRP/ESR to check for infection/inflammation.- **Imaging:** Ultrasound of the lymph node to rule out abscess; consider head/neck imaging if meningitis is suspected.- **Culture:** If abscess is suspected, aspiration/culture may guide antibiotic choice.3. **Treatment Considerations:**- **Antibiotics:** If bacterial infection is suspected (e.g., cephalexin, clindamycin).- **Pain Management:** NSAIDs (avoid overuse due to migraine history) and warm compresses for the lymph node.- **Migraine Management:** Reassess Aimovig/Aptiom with a neurologist if migraines recur.4. **Self-Care Measures:**- Avoid palpating the lymph node to prevent further irritation.- Monitor for fever, worsening headache, or neurological symptoms (e.g., confusion, vision changes).5. **Follow-Up:**- Re-evaluate within 24\u201348 hours if symptoms persist or worsen.- Address cystic acne with a dermatologist to prevent recurrent infections.### **When to Seek Urgent Care:**- Fever \u2265100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C).- Sudden neck stiffness, rash, or vomiting.- Worsening headache unresponsive to medication.- Signs of abscess (redness, pus, warmth).This presentation requires prompt clinical assessment to rule out serious conditions and initiate appropriate treatment. Prioritize evaluation today given the acute pain and systemic symptoms."

        "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \\\"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\\\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",

        "answer": "The presentation of your sister-in-law is complex and multifaceted, involving both neurological and psychiatric components. Below is a structured analysis of potential causes and recommended next steps:### **Key Considerations**1. **Status Epilepticus (Non-Convulsive)**- Prolonged altered mental status, repetitive seizures, and post-ictal confusion could indicate ongoing seizure activity. Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) may manifest as bizarre behavior, automatisms (e.g., random writing), or personality changes. An **urgent EEG** is critical to detect subtle seizure activity.2. **Autoimmune Encephalitis**- Conditions like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can present with seizures, psychiatric symptoms (third-person speech, mood swings), and neurologic deficits. The random writing and accent changes align with this. A **lumbar puncture** (to check for CSF antibodies/inflammation) and **MRI** (to assess for limbic encephalitis) are warranted.3. **Medication-Related Issues**- **Antidepressants** (e.g., SSRIs) and **sleeping pills** (e.g., benzodiazepines) can lower seizure thresholds or interact with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Check for:- **AED levels** (subtherapeutic due to non-compliance or malabsorption from purging).- **Drug toxicity** (e.g., serotonin syndrome, though less likely without hyperthermia/clonus).- **Withdrawal effects** (e.g., benzodiazepine withdrawal seizures).4. **Metabolic Disturbances**- **Electrolyte imbalances** (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia) from her eating disorder (purging/restricting) could precipitate seizures and confusion. Blood tests should prioritize electrolytes, glucose, and renal/liver function.5. **Structural Brain Lesions**- A new or missed lesion (e.g., tumor, vascular malformation) might explain seizures and behavioral changes. **CT/MRI** can help identify structural abnormalities.6. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**- While she has confirmed epilepsy, PNES could coexist. However, this is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out organic causes.### **Immediate Next Steps**- **EEG Monitoring**: To detect ictal or interictal activity, especially for NCSE.- **MRI Brain**: More sensitive than CT for detecting encephalitis, tumors, or temporal lobe pathology.- **Lumbar Puncture**: To evaluate for infection, autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDA antibodies), or paraneoplastic syndromes.- **Blood Work**: Electrolytes, AED levels, toxicology, autoimmune panels (e.g., anti-LGI1, anti-GAD65).- **Medication Review**: Assess for interactions (e.g., SSRIs + AEDs) or non-adherence.### **Potential Interventions**- **Seizure Control**: IV benzodiazepines or AEDs if NCSE is confirmed.- **Immunotherapy**: If autoimmune encephalitis is suspected (e.g., steroids, IVIG).- **Electrolyte Correction**: Address imbalances from her eating disorder.- **Psychiatric Support**: For dissociative symptoms or PNES, if organic causes are excluded.### **Conclusion**The combination of seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and metabolic risks from her eating disorder suggests a multifactorial etiology. Autoimmune encephalitis and NCSE are high on the differential. Urgent collaboration between neurology, psychiatry, and internal medicine is essential for targeted testing and treatment. Keep her stabilized in a monitored setting until a definitive diagnosis is reached."

Here's a breakdown of the risks and considerations:### **MDMA (Molly)**- **Seizure Risk**: MDMA is a stimulant that increases serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which can lower the seizure threshold. This means it could make seizures more likely.- **Neurotoxicity & Overheating**: MDMA can cause hyperthermia (overheating) and dehydration\u2014both known seizure triggers. Its neurotoxic effects may also exacerbate neurological vulnerabilities.- **Drug Interactions**: If you\u2019re taking anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), MDMA might interfere with their effectiveness or increase side effects.### **Cocaine**- **Immediate Danger**: Cocaine is a potent stimulant linked to sudden seizures, even in people without epilepsy. It raises heart rate and blood pressure, increasing the risk of seizures during use or withdrawal.- **Long-Term Risks**: Chronic use can damage the cardiovascular system and brain, compounding risks for someone with epilepsy.### **Weed & Alcohol Context**- **Cannabis**: While you\u2019ve tolerated it, THC (the psychoactive component) can sometimes trigger seizures in high doses. CBD (non-psychoactive) may have anticonvulsant properties, but products vary widely.- **Alcohol**: Though you\u2019re fine now, alcohol withdrawal is a common seizure trigger. Moderation is key.### **Key Considerations**1. **Epilepsy Management**: Stimulants (MDMA/cocaine) are particularly risky for lowering seizure thresholds. Your brain\u2019s frontal lobe is already sensitive due to epilepsy, making these substances more dangerous.2. **Drug Interactions**: AEDs may not work properly if mixed with illicit drugs, risking breakthrough seizures.3. **Brain Development**: At 18, your brain is still maturing. Substance use can impact this process.4. **Legal & Health Risks**: Both MDMA and cocaine carry addiction potential, legal consequences, and acute health risks (e.g., cardiac issues, overdose).### **Recommendations**- **Avoid MDMA/Cocaine**: The seizure risk and health dangers outweigh any temporary effects.- **Consult Your Neurologist**: Discuss your curiosity about these substances openly\u2014they can provide tailored advice.- **Safer Alternatives**: Explore hobbies, exercise, or creative outlets to combat boredom. If substance use is a coping mechanism, consider talking to a therapist.Your safety is the priority. Always prioritize your neurological health and seek professional guidance when unsure."

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\\\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \\\"hope to not have another one.\\\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \\\"headache\\\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

        "answer": "I am deeply sorry to hear about your fianc\u00e9e's critical condition. Here's a structured response based on medical knowledge and potential avenues to explore:### **Possible Causes to Investigate**1. **Autoimmune Encephalitis**:- **Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis**: Often presents with seizures and psychiatric symptoms. Requires specific antibody testing (CSF and blood). Treatment includes steroids, IVIG, or plasmapheresis.- **Other Autoantibodies**: Request testing for LGI1, CASPR2, GAD65, and Hashimoto\u2019s encephalopathy (anti-thyroid antibodies).2. **Infectious Etiologies**:- **Tick-Borne Illnesses**: Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, or Powassan virus (may require specialized PCR or serology tests).- **Vector-Borne Pathogens**: Consider mosquito-borne viruses (e.g., West Nile) given the camping context.3. **Metabolic/Toxic Causes**:- **SSRI-Related**: Prozac initiation/withdrawal can rarely trigger seizures. Review timing with neurologists.- **Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome**: Chronic marijuana use might contribute to cyclic vomiting but is less likely to explain seizures.4. **Genetic/Paraneoplastic**:- Genetic epilepsy syndromes (e.g., SCN1A mutations) or paraneoplastic disorders (screen for occult malignancies).---### **Treatment Options to Discuss with the Team**1. **Immunotherapy**:- **IVIG/Plasmapheresis**: If autoimmune suspected, even while awaiting lab results.- **Rituximab/Cyclophosphamide**: For refractory autoimmune cases.2. **Experimental/Adjunctive Therapies**:- **Allopregnanolone (Brexanolone)**: As mentioned, case studies show promise. Advocate for compassionate use.- **Ketogenic Diet**: Initiated via NG tube; shown to reduce refractory seizures.- **Therapeutic Hypothermia**: May reduce cerebral metabolic demand.3. **Barbiturate Coma**:- **Pentobarbital**: Effective but risks hypotension/infection. Ensure EEG burst suppression for 24\u201348 hours before slow weaning.4. **Surgical Options**:- **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)**: Acute implantation is rare but considered in extreme cases.- **Epilepsy Surgery**: If a focal seizure origin is identified (e.g., via fMRI if stable).---### **Prognosis and Recovery**- **Variable Outcomes**: Some patients recover near-baseline even after weeks of SRSE, particularly if the cause is treatable (e.g., autoimmune). Younger age and prior health are favorable factors.- **Neurological Monitoring**: Continuous EEG is critical to detect non-convulsive seizures. MRI once stable may reveal new insights (e.g., limbic encephalitis).- **Rehabilitation**: If seizures resolve, intensive neurorehabilitation (PT/OT/speech therapy) can optimize recovery.---### **Survivor Stories & Hope**- **Case Reports**: Patients with SRSE due to autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDA) often recover after months of treatment. A 2017 *Neurology* study documented recovery in 5/7 SRSE patients treated with ketogenic diet.- **Allopregnanolone**: The study you referenced (n=2) highlights potential adjunctive roles. Push for institutional approval or expanded access programs.---### **Practical Steps**1. **Advocate for Testing**:- Ensure CSF is tested for autoimmune/paraneoplastic panels and infectious PCRs (e.g., HSV, enteroviruses).- Consider tick-borne disease panels and repeat LP if clinical suspicion persists.2. **Seek Second Opinions**:- Contact specialized epilepsy centers (e.g., Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins) for teleconsultation.3. **Emotional Support**:- Connect with organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation or Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance for resources and community support.---### **Final Thoughts**While the road is arduous, recovery is not impossible. Stress to the team the urgency of excluding autoimmune causes and considering immunomodulation. Your advocacy is vital. Hold onto hope\u2014medicine has seen remarkable recoveries, even in prolonged SRSE. Stay close to your support network and lean on hospital social workers for guidance. You are not alone in this fight."

        "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Let's break down the terms from your MRI and diagnosis to provide clarity on their meanings and implications:### 1. **Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone**- **What it means**: This refers to enlargement of the ventricular trigone (a part of the brain\u2019s lateral ventricles) due to loss of nearby brain tissue. Think of it as a \"void\" created by atrophy, which the ventricle expands to fill.- **Relevance**: In your case, this is likely secondary to **mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS)** and **thalamic atrophy**, both of which involve tissue loss. It\u2019s a structural change, not a direct cause of seizures, but reflects chronic brain remodeling.---### 2. **T-weighted high-signal gliosis (in the right parietal periventricular white matter)**- **Gliosis**: Scarring caused by astrocytes (support cells) proliferating in response to injury (e.g., seizures, inflammation, or ischemia).- **T2/FLAIR high signal**: On MRI, gliosis appears bright in these sequences, indicating tissue damage.- **Periventricular white matter**: This is the brain tissue surrounding the ventricles, critical for communication between brain regions.- **Relevance**: The gliosis here suggests prior damage, possibly from seizure-related injury (\"seizure-induced excitotoxicity\") or an old ischemic event (e.g., reduced blood flow). This could contribute to network dysfunction, potentially worsening seizures or cognitive symptoms.---### 3. **Abnormalities in the right hippocampus**- **Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS)**: The hallmark of your epilepsy. MTS involves hippocampal neuron loss, scarring (sclerosis), and gliosis. This creates a hyperexcitable focus, making the hippocampus prone to generating seizures.- **MRI findings**: The hippocampus may appear shrunken (atrophic) with increased T2 signal. This structural damage is the primary driver of your focal impaired awareness seizures.---### 4. **Regional atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus**- **Dorsal thalamus**: A relay hub for sensory/motor signals and part of limbic circuits (connected to the hippocampus).- **Atrophy**: Shrinkage due to cell loss. This could result from:- **Seizure spread**: Repeated seizures damaging thalamic neurons.- **Remote effects**: The original insult that caused MTS (e.g., febrile seizures, infection) may have also affected the thalamus.- **Relevance**: Thalamic atrophy might contribute to seizure generalization (tonic-clonic seizures) or cognitive/memory issues, as the thalamus modulates cortical activity.---### 5. **Periventricular white matter**- This refers to white matter tracts near the ventricles. Damage here (e.g., gliosis) can disrupt communication between brain regions.- **Is it part of the damage?** Yes. The gliosis and ex-vacuo dilatation suggest prior injury, which could be linked to your epilepsy (e.g., from seizures or an underlying ischemic/inflammatory event).---### Putting It All Together:Your **right hippocampal MTS** is the core issue, likely causing focal seizures. Over time, seizures may have led to **secondary damage**:- **Thalamic atrophy**: From seizure spread or shared vulnerability.- **Periventricular gliosis**: Possibly from ischemia or excitotoxicity (seizure-related cell stress).- **Ventricular enlargement**: A consequence of tissue loss (ex-vacuo change).### Why Does This Matter Now?- **Drug-resistant epilepsy**: If seizures are worsening, it may reflect progression of MTS or network changes (e.g., thalamic atrophy enabling seizure generalization).- **Surgical evaluation**: MTS is often treatable with surgery (e.g., temporal lobectomy). A presurgical workup (e.g., EEG, neuropsych testing, PET) could assess candidacy.- **Cognitive/mood impacts**: Thalamic and hippocampal damage may affect memory, while periventricular gliosis could contribute to processing speed issues.Consider discussing these points with your neurologist, including whether advanced imaging (e.g., functional MRI) or surgical options are appropriate. Let me know if you\u2019d like help framing these questions!"

        "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",

        "answer": "The complexity of your symptoms suggests a multifactorial condition, likely involving autoimmune, neurological, and possibly systemic components. Here\u2019s a structured approach to guide further evaluation and management:### **Key Considerations & Next Steps**1. **Neuromuscular Junction Disorders**:- **Seronegative Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**: Despite negative antibodies, consider repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber EMG to confirm. Thymoma screening (CT chest) is warranted.- **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)**: Test for voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies and screen for underlying malignancy (e.g., small-cell lung cancer).2. **Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Syndromes**:- **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: Check for antibodies (e.g., anti-NMDA, anti-GAD65) via lumbar puncture and serum.- **Paraneoplastic Disorders**: Broad paraneoplastic panel (e.g., anti-Hu, anti-Yo) and cancer screening (CT/PET scans).3. **Central Nervous System (CNS) Causes**:- **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Despite normal MRI, consider spinal imaging or CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands.- **Seizure Re-Evaluation**: Ensure therapeutic levels of Trileptal/Lamictal; rule out drug interactions (e.g., Protonix causing hypomagnesemia).4. **Autonomic Dysfunction**:- **Dysautonomia**: Tilt-table test for POTS; assess for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (anti-gAChR antibodies).- **Vasculitis/Raynaud\u2019s**: Rheumatology referral for ANCA, ANA, and lupus panels. Skin biopsy if small-fiber neuropathy suspected.5. **Vestibular & Ocular Symptoms**:- **Oscillopsia/Nystagmus**: Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation for central causes (e.g., brainstem lesions, cerebellar dysfunction).- **Complex Migraines**: Consider vestibular migraine overlap; trial non-triptan preventives (e.g., topiramate, beta-blockers).6. **Medication Review**:- **Drug-Induced Effects**: Assess for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (Abilify/Seroquel), anticholinergic effects (Oxybutynin), or PPI-induced hypomagnesemia.- **Vaccine-Related**: Though rare, document symptom onset relative to Pfizer vaccines for possible autoimmune triggers.7. **Thyroid & Metabolic Workup**:- Ensure optimal thyroid control (TSH, free T4) and screen for Hashimoto\u2019s encephalopathy (anti-TPO antibodies).### **Immediate Actions**- **Consult Specialists**: Neuro-ophthalmologist, rheumatologist, and autonomic neurologist.- **Advanced Testing**: Lumbar puncture, EMG/NCS, paraneoplastic/autoimmune panels, CT chest.- **Symptom Management**: Physical therapy for vertigo; monitor for respiratory compromise (consider pulmonary function tests).### **Possible Diagnoses to Rule Out**- **Seronegative MG/LEMS**- **Autoimmune Encephalitis**- **MS or Demyelinating Disease**- **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**- **Systemic Autoimmunity (e.g., Lupus, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s)**Your case underscores the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. Persist in advocating for thorough testing, as overlapping symptoms may mask a unifying diagnosis. Keep a symptom diary to track triggers and responses to interventions. If standard evaluations remain inconclusive, consider referral to a tertiary center with expertise in rare neurological disorders."

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \\\"HELP\\\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your theory is both plausible and well-reasoned, considering the complexity of your wife's case. Here's a structured summary of the key points and recommendations:### Key Insights:1. **Dual Diagnosis Possibility**:- **Epilepsy and PNES Coexistence**: Up to 25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy. The return of hallucinations after discontinuing Keppra suggests that epileptic activity (which Keppra controlled) may underlie these symptoms. The EEG may not have captured epileptic seizures if they occur infrequently or if the monitored episodes were exclusively PNES.2. **Hallucinations and Epilepsy**:- Temporal lobe epilepsy can manifest with hallucinations. Keppra's effectiveness in suppressing these hallucinations supports the idea that they were ictal (seizure-related). The absence of epileptiform activity during the EEG does not rule out epilepsy entirely, as intermittent seizures might not have been recorded.3. **Medication Dynamics**:- **Keppra's Role**: Keppra likely controlled epileptic seizures, thereby resolving hallucinations. Its discontinuation may have unmasked untreated epileptic activity.- **Antipsychotics**: Initial partial response to antipsychotics (e.g., Risperdal) might reflect overlapping symptoms between psychiatric conditions and epilepsy, but the resolution of hallucinations on Keppra alone suggests epilepsy was the primary driver.### Recommendations:1. **Neurological Reassessment**:- Advocate for a follow-up EEG, ideally long-term or inpatient monitoring, to capture both seizure types (epileptic and PNES). This could clarify if epileptic activity correlates with hallucinations.- Discuss restarting Keppra or another antiepileptic drug (AED) with her neurologist, given the temporal link between Keppra cessation and symptom recurrence.2. **Psychiatric Collaboration**:- Ensure her psychiatrist and neurologist collaborate to address both PNES (via psychotherapy, CBT, or trauma-focused therapy) and potential epilepsy. A multidisciplinary approach is critical for comorbid conditions.3. **Consider Comorbidity**:- Treating PNES does not preclude concurrent epilepsy management. If hallucinations resolve upon reintroducing Keppra, this would strengthen the epilepsy hypothesis and justify long-term AED use alongside PNES therapy.4. **Safety and Monitoring**:- Monitor for safety risks (e.g., self-harm) during medication transitions. Gradual reintroduction of Keppra or another AED under medical supervision may be warranted.### Conclusion:Your hypothesis is valid and aligns with clinical evidence. The resurgence of hallucinations likely reflects untreated epileptic activity, underscoring the need for a nuanced approach to dual diagnosis. Persistent advocacy for comprehensive neurological and psychiatric care will be essential to optimize her treatment plan."

        "question": " Hi, I bit of back story here I've been diagnostic with NF1 when I was 5 ever since I had to do 2 MRI every year. every time they put a needle in my arm I would faint.So today I just got my blood draw for a schedule MRI in 3 weeks. And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you described\u2014fainting during needle procedures followed by involuntary movements\u2014are most consistent with **vasovagal syncope** with **convulsive syncope**. Here's a breakdown:### Key Terms:1. **Vasovagal Syncope**:- A common reflex triggered by stress (e.g., needles, pain, or anxiety), causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. This reduces blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting.- **Triggers in your case**: Needle insertion, stress from the procedure, or even dehydration/fasting before blood draws.2. **Convulsive Syncope**:- Occurs when reduced brain blood flow during fainting causes brief, involuntary muscle jerks or twitching (often mistaken for seizures). These movements are **not epileptic** but a response to temporary cerebral hypoxia.### Why This Fits Your Case:- **Pattern**: Fainting consistently with needles aligns with vasovagal syncope.- **Involuntary Movements**: The arm/leg movements likely stem from convulsive syncope, which resolves once blood flow to the brain is restored.### Ruling Out Other Causes:- **Seizures**: Unlikely if movements occurred *after* fainting and resolved quickly. However, NF1 can rarely involve seizures, so mention this episode to your doctor.- **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**: Stress-related episodes, but less likely given the clear trigger (needle).### Next Steps:1. **Consult Your Doctor**:- Report the involuntary movements to rule out seizures or neurological links to NF1.- Ask about a **tilt table test** (diagnoses vasovagal syncope) or **EEG** (checks for seizure activity).2. **Prevention Strategies**:- **Physical**: Lie down during procedures, stay hydrated, and avoid fasting.- **Behavioral**: Applied tension techniques (clenching muscles to raise blood pressure) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for needle phobia.- **Medical**: In some cases, doctors may prescribe beta-blockers or midodrine to stabilize blood pressure.3. **NF1 Considerations**:- While NF1 increases the risk of certain tumors or neuropathies, this episode is likely unrelated. Still, keep your care team informed.### Takeaway:This is a manageable reflex, not a sign of serious neurological damage. However, proactive steps (e.g., positioning, stress reduction) can help prevent future episodes. Always discuss new symptoms with your healthcare provider to ensure comprehensive care."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The ridges on your scalp, which you\u2019ve identified as potentially consistent with **Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG)**, warrant careful evaluation given your complex medical history. Here\u2019s a structured approach to address your concerns:### 1. **Understanding CVG**- **Primary CVG**: Rarely associated with neurodevelopmental conditions (outdated terms like \"mental retardation\" are no longer used; \"intellectual disability\" is preferred). This form is congenital but not universally linked to cognitive issues.- **Secondary CVG**: Arises from acquired conditions, such as:- Endocrine disorders (e.g., acromegaly from excess growth hormone).- Chronic inflammation, trauma, or prolonged scalp edema.- Rarely, systemic diseases (e.g., amyloidosis).### 2. **Your Situation**- **Mild Ridges**: CVG severity varies. Chemo-induced hair loss may have made subtle pre-existing ridges more noticeable.- **Medical History**: Non-epileptic seizures (migraine-related), deafness, and breast cancer treatment are key factors. These conditions don\u2019t directly cause CVG but may hint at broader systemic or genetic factors.- **Medications**: Effexor and Bupropion aren\u2019t linked to CVG, but chemo agents can cause skin changes (though not typically CVG).### 3. **Next Steps**- **Consult a Dermatologist First**:- Confirm the diagnosis via clinical exam \u00b1 biopsy.- Rule out mimics (e.g., traction alopecia, scarring alopecias).- **Endocrinologist Referral** (if indicated):- If acromegaly is suspected (e.g., enlarged hands/feet, facial changes), hormonal testing (growth hormone/IGF-1) would be warranted.- Obesity alone isn\u2019t diagnostic, but hormonal evaluation may be prudent given your history.- **Multidisciplinary Coordination**:- Inform your oncologist/neurologist to explore connections to chemo, migraines, or seizures (unlikely but worth contextualizing).### 4. **Reassurance**- Mild CVG often requires no treatment unless symptomatic (e.g., hygiene issues, discomfort).- No urgent link to cancer or chemo is established, but vigilance for underlying conditions is key.### 5. **Addressing Stigma**- Disregard outdated associations between CVG and intellectual disability. Your cognitive status and CVG are unrelated.### Final Recommendation:Start with a **dermatologist** to confirm CVG. If secondary causes (e.g., endocrine) are suspected, an **endocrinologist** can assist. Your neurologist and oncologist should remain informed to ensure holistic care."

        "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The decision to increase your son's Keppra dosage from 2ml to 3ml, despite apparent improvement, can be understood through several key considerations in epilepsy management:1. **Goal of Seizure Freedom**: The primary objective in epilepsy treatment is often complete cessation of seizures. Even minor episodes (e.g., dizziness) may represent \"auras\" or focal seizures, indicating residual abnormal brain activity. Eliminating all events reduces risks of worsening seizures or long-term neurological impact.2. **Titration to Therapeutic Dose**: Keppra dosing is typically weight-based and gradually increased to reach an effective level while minimizing side effects. The initial 2ml dose might be a starting point, with planned increments to achieve optimal therapeutic levels, ensuring sustained control as the body adapts.3. **Proactive Management**: Early dose adjustment can preempt breakthrough seizures. If the current dose is subtherapeutic, increasing it now may prevent future episodes, especially since the brain\u2019s adaptation to medication might reduce efficacy over time.4. **Safety and Tolerability**: Since your son tolerates 2ml well, the neurologist may anticipate that a modest increase to 3ml will maintain tolerability while enhancing efficacy. Monitoring for side effects (e.g., mood changes) remains crucial.5. **Clinical Guidelines**: Protocols often recommend dose adjustments based on response. Your son\u2019s reduction in seizures suggests partial efficacy, warranting a dose optimization to align with standard regimens for his age/weight.**Next Steps**:- **Discuss Concerns with the Neurologist**: Ask for clarification on the rationale, target dose, and plans for monitoring both efficacy and side effects.- **Inquire About Alternatives**: Explore if a \"wait-and-see\" approach is feasible, or if blood level testing (if applicable) could guide dosing.- **Balance Risks/Benefits**: Emphasize your preference for the minimal effective dose while respecting the need to prevent seizures.Trust in ongoing dialogue with the neurologist ensures collaborative decision-making, prioritizing your son\u2019s health with informed choices."

        "question": "48F, 152cm, 70kgGraves' disease in and out of remission for 10 years (remission last 2 years)Stopped carbimazole two weeks agoVery mild temporal lobe epilepsy for 30 yearsLevetiracetam 500mg dailyTetanus vaccination for deep cat scratch five days agoJust finishing a 5-day course of amoxicillin w/ clavulanic acid for same scratchA few days ago, I noticed some swelling above my left clavicle, and I can feel a pea-to-marble sized lump. Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The swelling above your left clavicle is likely a reactive lymph node, and several factors support this benign explanation:1. **Tetanus Vaccination**: Lymph node swelling near the injection site (left arm in your case) is a common immune response to vaccines. This reaction typically occurs within days to a week post-vaccination and aligns with your timeline.2. **Cat Scratch**: Even though you completed antibiotics, the lymph node may still be responding to the initial injury or infection. Cat scratch disease (Bartonella) can cause persistent lymphadenopathy, but amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is often effective, suggesting the node may resolve with time.3. **Medications/History**:- **Carbimazole**: While it can affect white blood cells, your normal neutrophils (recently checked) and\u505c\u836f\u4e24\u5468 make adverse effects less likely here.- **Levetiracetam**: Not typically linked to lymphadenopathy.- **Low Lymphocytes**: Likely related to Graves\u2019 disease (autoimmune) or chronicity, but less relevant to acute swelling.4. **Location Concerns**: While left supraclavicular nodes can rarely signal serious conditions (e.g., malignancy), your recent immune triggers (vaccine, scratch) make benign causes far more probable.### Next Steps:- **Monitor**: Note if the node grows, becomes painful, or is accompanied by fever/night sweats/weight loss.- **Doctor\u2019s Appointment**: They may palpate the node, check for resolution, or order an ultrasound/CBC if concerns persist.- **Reassurance**: Reactive nodes from vaccines or minor infections often resolve within weeks. Your proactive approach to follow-up is appropriate.**Takeaway**: While vigilance is wise, the context strongly favors a benign cause. Breathe easy until your appointment, and avoid Google\u2019s alarmist rabbit holes!"

        "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to feel concerned about a delayed dose of epilepsy medication, especially with important activities planned. Here's a structured summary of the situation and recommendations:### Medication Considerations:1. **Vimpat (lacosamide):**- **Half-life:** ~13 hours. A 3-hour delay (15 vs. 12 hours between doses) may cause a slight dip in blood levels, but taking it as soon as remembered helps mitigate this.- **Action:** Resume your regular schedule. Steady-state levels should stabilize within 1-2 days if doses are taken consistently moving forward.2. **Phenobarbital:**- **Half-life:** 80-120 hours. Its long half-life means levels remain relatively stable even with a 3-hour delay. Missing a single dose by a few hours is unlikely to significantly affect seizure protection.### Immediate Steps:- **Continue your regular dosing schedule.** Do not double up on doses unless explicitly advised by your doctor.- **Monitor for symptoms:** Be alert to auras, unusual sensations, or prodromal signs (e.g., mood changes, sleep disturbances). These could signal increased seizure risk.- **Limit high-risk activities:** If possible, postpone driving or have alternative transportation arranged until you feel confident in your stability. If you experience any warning signs, avoid driving entirely.### When to Expect Stability:- **Vimpat:** Levels should stabilize within 24\u201348 hours of resuming regular dosing.- **Phenobarbital:** Due to its long half-life, a single delayed dose likely has minimal impact. Levels remain steady over days.### When to Seek Help:- Contact your doctor immediately if you experience seizure activity, prolonged auras, or new symptoms.- Follow up with your doctor\u2019s office if you haven\u2019t heard back, as they may adjust your regimen or provide personalized guidance.### Final Notes:While the risk of breakthrough seizures is likely low given the short delay and prompt dose administration, individual variability exists. Proactive monitoring and caution are key. Your doctor\u2019s input remains critical for tailored advice. Stay vigilant, prioritize safety, and avoid pushing through any warning signs."

        "question": "28F. 5'8, 250lbs. White. History of epilepsy, asthma and vitamin D & B12 deficiency. Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "### Summary of Key Points:1. **Diagnosis Confirmation**:- Your FSH level of 122.2 miU/mL is strongly indicative of **premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)**, especially with absent menstruation for 6 months. A repeat FSH test in 4-6 weeks is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Estrogen levels (likely low) will further support this.2. **Chances of Spontaneous Ovarian Recovery**:- **Low but not impossible**: ~5-10% of individuals with POI may experience intermittent ovarian function, but sustained recovery of regular cycles is rare. Fertility is typically severely reduced, but pregnancy is still possible (albeit unlikely), so discuss contraception if avoiding pregnancy.3. **Potential Causes**:- **Autoimmune disorders** (e.g., linked to your B12 deficiency, which may suggest autoimmune conditions like pernicious anemia).- **Genetic factors** (e.g., Fragile X premutation, Turner syndrome).- **Idiopathic** (no identifiable cause in many cases).- Other: Chemotherapy/radiation, infections, or metabolic disorders (less likely based on your history).4. **Next Steps/Testing**:- **Hormonal workup**: Check LH, estradiol, AMH, and thyroid/adrenal hormones (to rule out autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes).- **Autoimmune screening**: Anti-ovarian antibodies, thyroid antibodies, adrenal antibodies.- **Genetic testing**: Karyotype and Fragile X premutation testing.- **Bone density scan**: To assess osteoporosis risk from low estrogen.5. **Health Risks to Address**:- **Estrogen deficiency**: Increases risks of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and genitourinary symptoms (e.g., vaginal atrophy).- **Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)**: Strongly recommended until average menopause age (~50) to mitigate risks. Discuss options (e.g., transdermal estrogen + progesterone) with your doctor.- **Mental health**: POI can impact mood and quality of life; psychological support is key.6. **Other Considerations**:- **Fertility**: If future pregnancy is desired, discuss options like egg donation or fertility preservation (if any ovarian function remains).- **Drug interactions**: Lamotrigine does not typically interfere with HRT, but ensure close monitoring with your neurologist.- **Vitamin D/B12**: Continue supplements to support bone and neurological health.### Final Note:POI is a significant diagnosis, but with proper HRT and monitoring, long-term health risks can be managed effectively. Advocate for a comprehensive evaluation to identify underlying causes and a tailored care plan. A reproductive endocrinologist or menopause specialist can provide specialized guidance."

        "answer": "The cognitive and linguistic challenges you're experiencing are concerning and warrant a thorough neurological re-evaluation. Here's a structured approach to understanding and addressing these issues:### Key Considerations:1. **Seizure-Related Brain Injury**:- **Hypoxic Damage**: Prolonged seizures, especially those causing respiratory arrest, can lead to hypoxia, potentially damaging brain regions critical for memory (temporal lobes) and language (Broca\u2019s/Wernicke\u2019s areas).- **Cumulative Effects**: Even reduced seizure frequency might contribute to progressive cognitive decline over time due to repeated neuronal stress.2. **Underlying Etiologies**:- **Structural Abnormalities**: Undetected lesions (e.g., from past trauma, tumors, vascular malformations) could explain both seizures and cognitive symptoms. A high-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocols is essential.- **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: Conditions like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis present with seizures and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Blood/CSP tests for autoantibodies may be warranted.- **Subclinical Seizures**: Non-convulsive seizures (detectable via EEG) might cause ongoing cognitive disruption without obvious physical symptoms.3. **Diagnostic Gaps**:- Previous evaluations may have missed evolving or subtle pathologies. Reassessment with advanced tools is critical.### Recommended Steps:1. **Advanced Imaging**:- **MRI with Epilepsy Protocol**: Focus on temporal lobes and language areas. Include contrast and sequences sensitive to subtle lesions.- **PET/SPECT**: If MRI is inconclusive, functional imaging might identify areas of abnormal activity.2. **Neurophysiological Testing**:- **Long-Term Video EEG**: Capture brain activity during cognitive difficulties or suspected subclinical seizures.- **Ambulatory EEG**: Monitor brain activity in daily settings.3. **Laboratory Workup**:- **Autoimmune Panels**: Check for anti-neuronal antibodies in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.- **Metabolic Screening**: Rule out rare inherited disorders (e.g., porphyria, mitochondrial diseases).4. **Neuropsychological Assessment**:- Quantify memory, language, and executive function deficits to localize brain dysfunction and guide rehab.5. **Specialist Consultation**:- **Epileptologist**: For refractory seizure management.- **Speech-Language Therapist**: Address aphasia/dysfluency.- **Cognitive Rehab**: Tailored exercises to mitigate memory/attention deficits.### Management Options:- **Seizure Control**: Revisit AEDs with newer agents (e.g., brivaracetam, perampanel) if previous trials were older drugs. Consider non-pharmacological options (e.g., ketogenic diet, VNS).- **Autoimmune Treatment**: If encephalitis is confirmed, immunotherapy (steroids, IVIG, rituximab) may halt progression.- **Surgical Evaluation**: If a focal seizure origin is identified, resection or ablation could be curative.### Psychosocial Support:- **Mental Health**: Chronic epilepsy increases depression/anxiety risk. Counseling or support groups may help.- **Vocational Rehab**: Assist with adaptations for cognitive challenges in work/education.### Urgency:Progressive cognitive decline in young adulthood is atypical and demands prompt investigation. Advocate for expedited referrals to tertiary care centers with epilepsy/neurodegenerative expertise.Your history of cluster seizures and respiratory arrest heightens the need to rule out structural or autoimmune causes. Persistent symptoms despite reduced seizures suggest an evolving process\u2014timely intervention could stabilize or improve outcomes."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "**Summary and Recommendations:****1. Keppra (Levetiracetam) Overdose Context:**- **Typical Dose:** Up to 3,000 mg/day for epilepsy. Your intake of **42,000 mg (42 grams)** is significantly above therapeutic levels.- **Acute Effects:** Drowsiness, vomiting, agitation, or respiratory depression are common in overdoses. Your vomiting likely reduced absorption, and waking up feeling normal suggests no immediate life-threatening complications.**2. Long-Term Health Risks:**- **Kidneys:** Levetiracetam is primarily excreted by the kidneys. While acute kidney injury is rare in isolated overdoses, consider a **renal function test** (e.g., blood creatinine, BUN) to rule out subtle damage.- **Liver:** Unlikely affected, as metabolism is minimal. However, a **liver function test** (ALT, AST) could provide reassurance.- **Brain:** No evidence of direct neurotoxicity. Prolonged hypoxia (e.g., from respiratory depression) could cause harm, but your quick recovery makes this improbable.**3. Mortality Risk:**- **Survivability:** Most reported overdoses (even large ones) are non-fatal due to Keppra\u2019s wide therapeutic window. Death is rare but possible with extreme doses or mixed sedatives.- **Likely Cause of Death:** Respiratory failure (if severe), which typically involves gradual unconsciousness, minimizing pain perception.**4. Immediate Actions:**- **Medical Evaluation:** Schedule a checkup to assess kidney/liver function and discuss mental health. Blood tests are prudent despite feeling well.- **Mental Health Support:** Overdoses often signal underlying distress. Reach out to a counselor or trusted professional to address emotional well-being.**5. Key Reassurance:**- A month without symptoms is a positive sign. Chronic organ damage from a single Keppra overdose is highly unlikely in a healthy individual.**Final Note:** Always seek emergency care immediately after an overdose.

        "answer": "The recurring painful tongue lesions you describe could stem from several factors related to your medical conditions, medications, or other causes. Here\u2019s a structured approach to understanding and addressing this issue:---### **Possible Causes**1. **Autoimmune-Related Oral Lesions**:- **Crohn\u2019s Disease**: Oral manifestations like aphthous ulcers (canker sores) are common.- **Lupus (SLE)**: Discoid lupus lesions or oral ulcers (though SLE ulcers are often painless).- **Lichen Planus**: Painful, lacy white lesions or red erosions, linked to autoimmune conditions.2. **Medication Side Effects**:- **Antiseizure Drugs (Levetiracetam, Lacosamide, Perampanel)**: Known to cause stomatitis or oral ulcers.- **Mesalazine**: Rarely triggers lichenoid reactions (mimicking lichen planus).- **Immunosuppressants (Rituximab, Steroids)**: Increase infection risk (e.g., oral thrush, herpes).3. **Infections**:- **Fungal (Candida)**: White coating after lesions may suggest secondary thrush, especially with immunosuppression.- **Viral (HSV/CMV)**: Atypical presentations due to weakened immunity.4. **Nutritional Deficiencies**:- Crohn\u2019s and steroids/pantoprazole can cause deficiencies in B12, iron, or folate, worsening mucosal health.5. **Other**:- **Erythema Multiforme**: Target-like lesions triggered by infections or drugs.- **Geographic Tongue**: Red patches with white borders, though typically less painful.---### **Next Steps for Diagnosis**1. **Specialist Consultation**:- **Oral Medicine Specialist/Dentist**: Expertise in mucosal diseases (gold standard for evaluation).- **Dermatologist**: If oral specialists are unavailable, as lichen planus or drug reactions fall under their scope.- **ENT or Rheumatologist**: To rule out systemic causes.2. **Testing**:- **Biopsy**: Critical to confirm lichen planus, lupus, or infection.- **Swab Tests**: For Candida, HSV, or CMV.- **Bloodwork**: Check for nutritional deficiencies (B12, iron, folate) and inflammatory markers.---### **Symptomatic Relief**- **Topical Anesthetics**: Lidocaine gel or mouth rinses (e.g., \u201cMagic Mouthwash\u201d with lidocaine/diphenhydramine).- **Coating Agents**: Sucralfate suspension or oral pastes (e.g., Orabase).- **Steroid Rinses/Gels**: Clobetasol or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation (if not fungal).- **Antifungals**: Nystatin rinse or fluconazole if thrush is confirmed.---### **Prevention Strategies**- **Oral Hygiene**: Use alcohol-free mouthwash and soft-bristle toothbrushes.- **Medication Review**: Collaborate with your doctors to assess if any drugs (e.g., antiseizure meds) can be adjusted.- **Nutrition**: Address deficiencies with supplements (if labs confirm need).- **Stress Management**: Stress can trigger flares in autoimmune conditions.---### **Key Takeaway**This is likely multifactorial\u2014your autoimmune conditions, medications, and immunosuppression all play roles.

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",

Requires psychological evaluation despite no prior mental health history.5. **Metabolic/Systemic Issues**:- **Electrolyte/Vitamin Deficiencies** (e.g., magnesium, B12).- **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: Antibody-mediated inflammation causing neurological symptoms (test via lumbar puncture/antibody panels).6. **Medication-Related**:- **Rebound Headaches**: From prior overuse of analgesics, though Tylenol is lower risk.- **Serotonin Syndrome**: If previous medications included SSRIs/TCAs, but less likely now.### Key Recommendations:1. **Specialist Referrals**:- **Pediatric Neurologist** with expertise in complex epilepsy/migraine disorders.- **Autonomic Specialist** for dysautonomia evaluation (tilt table test).- **Metabolic Geneticist** for inborn errors of metabolism.2. **Diagnostic Testing**:- **Video EEG Monitoring**: Capture an episode to differentiate epilepsy vs. PNES.- **MRI/MRA** of the brain: Rule out structural abnormalities.- **Bloodwork**: Metabolic panel, autoimmune markers (ANA, anti-NMDA), Lyme titers, vitamin levels.- **Lumbar Puncture**: If autoimmune encephalitis is suspected.- **Genetic Testing**: Panels for channelopathies or mitochondrial disorders.3. **Environmental/Behavioral Tracking**:- **Symptom Diary**: Log episodes (time, triggers, food, activities, symptoms).- **Environmental Triggers**: Note lighting, screen time, stressors, or dietary factors (e.g., caffeine, additives).4. **Tertiary Care Centers**:- Seek evaluation at a children\u2019s hospital with a neurology/autonomic clinic (e.g., CHOP in Philadelphia, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic).5. **Psychological Support**:- Even if PNES is not suspected, counseling can help Fiona cope with chronic symptoms.### Next Steps for the Family:- **Advocate for Referrals**: Push for a second opinion at a specialized center.- **Organize Records**: Compile all medical notes, imaging, and test results for review.- **Support Groups**: Connect with organizations like the Child Neurology Foundation or Migraine Research Foundation for resources.Fiona\u2019s case underscores the need for persistent advocacy and comprehensive evaluation. While the path to diagnosis may be challenging, a systematic approach combining advanced testing and expert consultation offers the best hope for answers."

        "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\\\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\\\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The MRI findings and clinical history suggest several key points for consideration as you prepare for your neurologist appointment:### 1. **Encephalomalacia/Gliosis Post-Surgery**- **Expected?** Yes. These changes are common after brain surgery.- **Encephalomalacia** (softening of brain tissue) often occurs at surgical sites due to tissue removal or healing.- **Gliosis** (scarring) is a natural response to injury.- **New Changes?** The MRI notes *new* encephalomalacia/gliosis near the resection site. This could indicate delayed healing, minor trauma, or an evolving area of irritation that may now act as a seizure focus. It does not necessarily imply surgical failure but warrants investigation.---### 2. **Possible Treatment Pathways**- **Medication Reintroduction/Adjustment**- The breakthrough seizure after weaning off meds suggests his brain may still need pharmaceutical support.- **Vimpat (lacosamide) 400mg**: The neurologist may increase the dose or add a second anti-seizure drug (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine).- Many patients achieve control with adjusted medications, especially if seizures are focal (originating in one area).- **Surgical Reevaluation**- Surgery is less urgent unless seizures become frequent/drug-resistant.- The MRI shows no clear new mass or lesion, but the new gliosis/encephalomalacia *could* act as an epileptogenic focus.- **Next Steps**:- **Video EEG Monitoring**: To confirm if seizures originate from the new gliotic area.- **Advanced Imaging** (PET, SPECT): To identify metabolic changes correlating with seizure onset.- **Neuropsychological Testing**: To assess risks of resecting tissue near memory-critical areas (parahippocampal gyrus).---### 3. **Key Considerations**- **Craniosynostosis/IL11RA Variant**: This genetic predisposition may contribute to structural vulnerabilities (e.g., encephalocele recurrence, CSF leaks). Ensure the tegmen mastoideum repair is stable (a CSF leak could provoke seizures).- **Seizure Semiology**: A single breakthrough seizure after medication withdrawal doesn\u2019t always mean relapse. The neurologist will assess risk factors (e.g., EEG abnormalities, MRI changes) to guide long-term plans.---### 4. **What to Ask the Neurologist**- Could the new encephalomalacia/gliosis explain the seizure?- Is there evidence of ongoing instability (e.g., CSF leak, recurrent encephalocele)?- Would a higher dose or additional medication suffice, or is further testing (EEG, PET) needed?- Under what circumstances would surgery be reconsidered?---### **Bottom Line**The MRI findings are not uncommon post-surgery, but the new changes may indicate a susceptible area for seizures. Medication optimization is the likely next step, with surgery reserved if seizures persist despite therapy. Your husband\u2019s prior success with surgery and medications suggests a favorable prognosis with careful management. Stay hopeful, and use the upcoming appointment to clarify a tailored plan. \ud83c\udf1f"

        "question": "42 F Lamictal, cymbalta, singulair, levothyroxine, Pepcid, ambien 200lbs (significant weight gain in 3 years after injury to cervical spine - unable to run like I used to so I\u2019m confident that is the main reason why) 3-4 drinks per year, past prescription drug use (all prescribed but over used/abused) no addictive medications for almost 2 years besides ambien but now I\u2019m very careful. Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a seizure but it\u2019s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it\u2019s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d.

        "answer": "The symptoms you're experiencing, where sensory inputs (like sight) trigger additional sensory experiences (such as touch or smell), align with **synesthesia**, a genuine neurological phenomenon supported by scientific evidence. Here's a structured breakdown:### Key Considerations:1. **Synesthesia Overview**:- **Definition**: A condition where stimulation of one sense involuntarily activates another (e.g., seeing a color when hearing music). It is typically congenital but can rarely be acquired.- **Acquired Synesthesia**: Documented cases link it to brain changes from injury, sensory deprivation, or neurological conditions. Your controlled epilepsy and medication (e.g., Lamictal) might have altered neural connectivity, potentially enabling cross-sensory experiences.2. **Neurological and Medication Factors**:- **Epilepsy Control**: Seizure reduction may allow previously suppressed neural pathways to become more active, fostering sensory cross-talk.- **Medications**: Lamictal (affects glutamate/sodium channels) and Singulair (rare neuropsychiatric side effects) could contribute to altered sensory processing. However, direct links to synesthesia are not well-established.3. **Differential Diagnoses**:- **Mirror-Touch Synesthesia**: A subtype where observing touch elicits a tactile sensation, closely matching your experience of feeling hugs or pain seen on screen.- **Non-Seizure Auras or Sensory Hyperawareness**: Unlikely, as your neurologist ruled out seizures.- **Psychiatric Conditions**: Less likely without impaired reality testing; your experiences are isolated and non-distressing.4. **Lifestyle and History**:- **Nicotine Use**: High-dose nicotine (Juul) may influence neurotransmitter systems, though timing correlation is unclear.- **Past Substance Use**: No current addictive medications, minimizing this as a factor.### Recommendations:- **Neurological Follow-Up**: Revisit your neurologist or consult a neuropsychologist to explore acquired synesthesia and rule out subtle structural changes (e.g., MRI if not recently done).- **Medication Review**: Discuss potential medication side effects, especially Singulair\u2019s neuropsychiatric profile.- **Monitoring**: Track the frequency/context of symptoms. Note any new or worsening issues (e.g., hallucinations, mood changes).### Reassurance:- Synesthesia itself is not harmful or a mental disorder. Many synesthetes find their experiences enriching. Your case may reflect adaptive neuroplasticity post-seizure control rather than a degenerative process.### Conclusion:While unusual, your symptoms likely represent acquired synesthesia linked to neurological changes from epilepsy management. Continued collaboration with your care team will help ensure clarity and peace of mind."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Here's a breakdown of your MRI findings and their implications, presented in a clear, organized manner:### **Normal Findings (Reassuring):**1. **No Acute Issues:**- **Hemorrhage, Stroke, or Mass:** Absence of acute bleeding, stroke (infarction), tumors, swelling (edema), or hydrocephalus.- **Stable Structures:** Ventricles, sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable, with no significant brain atrophy.2. **Comparison to 2018 MRI:**- No major progression (e.g., new masses or worsening atrophy), suggesting stability in most areas.---### **Key Finding: Punctate T2/FLAIR White Matter Lesions (Right Side)**- **What Are They?**Small, dot-like bright spots on MRI sequences sensitive to fluid changes (T2/FLAIR). These are common and often nonspecific.- **Possible Causes:**1. **Microvascular Ischemic Changes:**- Linked to tiny blood vessel changes, often from aging, hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol. These are typically asymptomatic but may correlate with vascular risk factors.2. **Migraines:**- Chronic migraines can sometimes cause similar white matter changes.3. **Demyelination (e.g., MS):**- Less likely but not excluded. MS lesions often have specific patterns (e.g., near ventricles, in optic nerves). Your report does not confirm this.- **Why \u201cDemyelinating Disease Not Excluded\u201d?**- Radiologists mention this to acknowledge rare possibilities. Further evaluation (e.g., clinical symptoms, spinal MRI, lumbar puncture) may be needed if MS is suspected. However, your history of epilepsy and migraines makes this less likely.---### **Context for Your Case:**- **Epilepsy Connection:** Unlikely related to left temporal lobe epilepsy, as these right-sided lesions are in a different area.- **Migraines/Headaches:** Could contribute to white matter changes. Propranolol and Ubrelvy are appropriate preventives/abortives.- **Medications:** Topamax and lamotrigine are not directly linked to these MRI findings.---### **Next Steps:**1. **Neurologist Follow-Up:**- Discuss whether these lesions are new vs. stable compared to 2018. If stable, they\u2019re likely benign.- Address vascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar) if applicable.2. **MS Evaluation (if needed):**- Only if you have symptoms like numbness, vision changes, or balance issues. Your report does not strongly suggest MS.3. **Migraine Management:**- Optimize prevention (e.g., adjust Topamax/Propranolol) if headaches persist.---### **Conclusion:**These findings are common and often incidental. While they warrant review, they\u2019re not urgent or indicative of serious conditions like stroke or tumor. Follow up with your neurologist to correlate symptoms and plan monitoring. Most importantly, this report does not suggest a dangerous or rapidly progressing condition.Let me know if you\u2019d like help preparing questions for your doctor!"

        "answer": "For a 23-year-old male with light-triggered epilepsy (no active seizures), ADHD, anxiety, and insomnia, considering the use of liquid Nytol (diphenhydramine):1. **Risk Assessment**:- **Diphenhydramine** (Nytol\u2019s active ingredient) may lower the seizure threshold, posing potential risks even in mild epilepsy. Though his seizures are light-triggered, the medication could increase susceptibility.- **Side Effects**: Drowsiness, dry mouth, and next-day grogginess may occur, which could exacerbate anxiety or ADHD symptoms indirectly.2. **Non-Pharmacological Alternatives**:- **Sleep Hygiene**: Consistent bedtime routine, reducing screen time (to avoid light triggers), and relaxation techniques (e.g., mindfulness).- **Behavioral Strategies**: Address ADHD-related winding-down challenges with structured pre-sleep activities.3. **Safer Medication Options**:- **Melatonin**: Considered low-risk for sleep regulation, with some evidence of potential anticonvulsant properties, though medical consultation is advised.- **Prescription Options**: Trazodone or SSRIs (for anxiety/sleep) may be safer for seizure thresholds but require professional guidance.4. **Consult Healthcare Providers**:- **Neurologist/Psychiatrist**: Essential to evaluate risks of diphenhydramine and explore tailored solutions.- **Address Comorbidities**: Treating ADHD/anxiety (e.g., therapy, non-stimulant medications) may improve sleep long-term.**Conclusion**: Avoid self-medicating with Nytol due to seizure risks. Prioritize medical advice to balance safety and efficacy, incorporating lifestyle changes and safer alternatives if needed."

FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the details provided, here's a structured approach to your situation:### **Clinical Concerns:**1. **Possible Injuries:**- **Scaphoid Fracture:** Pain at the base of the thumb (\"anatomic snuffbox\" tenderness) and difficulty gripping are classic signs. Scaphoid fractures are high-risk for complications (e.g., avascular necrosis) if missed.- **Distal Radius Fracture:** FOOSH injuries often cause Colles\u2019 or Smith\u2019s fractures, though deformity would typically be obvious.- **Ligament/Tendon Injury:** Pain radiating along the wrist may suggest soft tissue damage (e.g., scapholunate ligament tear).2. **Medical History Factors:**- **Graves\u2019 Disease:** Untreated hyperthyroidism can weaken bones, increasing fracture risk.- **Carbimazole/Levetiracetam:** No direct interaction, but ensure pain management (e.g., paracetamol) doesn\u2019t conflict with existing medications.---### **Red Flags (Go to ED Immediately If):**- Severe or worsening pain/swelling.- New numbness/tingling (median or ulnar nerve compromise).- Inability to move fingers or pale/cold fingers (vascular compromise).- Signs of infection in the road rash (redness, pus, fever).---### **Recommendations:**1. **Immediate Self-Care:**- **Immobilize:** Use a splint or brace to stabilize the wrist and thumb (e.g., a thumb spica splint). Avoid movement.- **RICE:** Rest, Ice (15-20 mins every 2-3 hours), Compress (lightly), Elevate.- **Pain Relief:** Paracetamol is safe; avoid NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) if possible due to potential bone-healing concerns.2. **Imaging:**- **If Red Flags Present:** Seek ED care immediately for X-ray \u00b1 advanced imaging (CT/MRI).- **If Stable Until Monday:** Schedule an X-ray first thing Monday. Insist on scaphoid-specific views. If X-ray is negative but pain persists, request follow-up imaging (repeat X-ray in 7\u201310 days or MRI/CT).3. **Why Consider ED Now?**- Early scaphoid fractures may not appear on X-rays immediately. EDs can offer advanced imaging (CT) if suspicion is high.- Delayed treatment of fractures risks long-term complications (e.g., non-union, arthritis).---### **Bottom Line:**While waiting until Monday is *possible* if symptoms are stable and red flags are absent, **urgent evaluation is strongly advised** due to the risk of occult fractures. If you choose to wait:- Strictly immobilize the wrist/thumb.- Avoid weight-bearing or gripping.- Monitor closely for red flags.If in doubt, err on the side of caution and visit the ED for prompt assessment.

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

        "answer": "Based on your detailed history and concerns, here's a structured approach to address your questions and potential next steps:### **1. Medication Expiration and Efficacy**- **Expiration Dates:** While medications typically remain effective beyond their expiration dates if stored properly, your personal experience suggests sensitivity to even minor decreases in Lamictal XR potency. Given your history of lower blood levels and breakthrough seizures with older batches (even before expiration), it is reasonable to:- **Switch to Newer Bottles:** Use the newer bottles expiring in June 2023, as your neuro previously noted that older batches (6+ months pre-expiry) may be less effective for you. This aligns with your past improvement when switching bottles.- **Storage:** Ensure bottles are stored in a cool, dry place (avoid dressers in humid environments; consider a medication cabinet).### **2. Dosage Formulation (200mg vs. 300mg XR)**- **Same Manufacturer (GSK):** If both 200mg and 300mg tablets are from GSK, the extended-release mechanism should be consistent. However:- **Confirm with Pharmacist/Neuro:** Verify that the 300mg XR tablets have the same release profile as the 200mg. While unlikely, differences in coating or dissolution could theoretically affect absorption.- **Dosing Schedule:** Lamictal XR is typically taken **once daily**. If you are currently splitting 200mg tablets into three doses, switching to two 300mg tablets (e.g., morning and evening) may stabilize levels better. Clarify this with your neuro to ensure optimal dosing.### **3. Blood Level Monitoring**- **Immediate Action:** Request a Lamictal blood level test to assess current levels. Target therapeutic range for Lamictal is often 3\u201314 \u00b5g/mL, but individual responses vary. Your previous level of 12 \u00b5g/mL at 600mg/day was effective; a repeat test can guide adjustments.### **4. Lifestyle and Stress Management**- **Seizure Triggers:** Prioritize sleep hygiene and stress reduction (e.g., therapy, mindfulness). Even with adequate drug levels, poor sleep and stress lower seizure thresholds.- **Document Triggers:** Keep a seizure diary tracking sleep, stress, medication changes, and headaches.### **5. Next Steps with Your Neurologist**- Discuss:- Discarding older bottles expiring in August 2022.- Whether the 300mg XR formulation could alter absorption.- Rechecking Lamictal blood levels.- Adding a rescue medication (e.g., clonazepam) for acute stress periods.- Exploring adjunct therapies (e.g., levetiracetam) if breakthrough seizures persist.### **Summary of Recommendations**- **Switch to Newer Bottles:** Given your history, use the June 2023-expiring bottles.- **Verify Dosing Schedule:** Ensure you\u2019re taking XR correctly (once daily unless directed otherwise).- **Check Blood Levels:** Confirm Lamictal levels are within your therapeutic range.- **Address Lifestyle Factors:** Prioritize sleep and stress management.- **Follow Up with Neuro:** Address formulation questions and consider a seizure action plan.Your proactive approach is commendable. While expiration dates are conservative guidelines, your unique response warrants caution with older batches. Collaborate closely with your neuro to tailor your regimen further."

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",

        "answer": "The situation described raises several important medical considerations. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### Key Medical Points:1. **Neonatal Seizures**:- Seizures in newborns are always concerning and require thorough evaluation. Common causes include:- **Metabolic imbalances** (e.g., hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia).- **Infections** (e.g., meningitis, sepsis).- **Birth trauma/asphyxia** (e.g., HIE\u2014hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy).- **Genetic or neurological conditions** (e.g., benign familial neonatal seizures, epilepsy syndromes).- Subtle seizures (e.g., rhythmic movements, apnea, staring) are common in neonates and may not always show obvious convulsions.2. **Timing of Seizures**:- Seizures occurring **after discharge** (3 days post-birth) are unusual for transient causes like maternal stress during delivery. Stress-related effects (e.g., from maternal anxiety or shivering) typically resolve quickly and would not explain delayed seizures.3. **Neurologist\u2019s Explanation**:- The claim that maternal stress during labor caused seizures days later is **medically unsupported**. While maternal stress can transiently affect fetal physiology (e.g., via catecholamine release), this does not explain seizures days post-delivery. This explanation may reflect oversimplification or miscommunication.4. **Normal Initial Tests**:- Normal brain imaging (e.g., MRI/CT) and reflexes are reassuring but do not rule out all causes. Some conditions (e.g., metabolic disorders, genetic epilepsy) may require specialized testing (e.g., EEG, genetic panels, metabolic screens).### Recommendations for the Family:1. **Advocate for Further Testing**:- **EEG**: To assess for abnormal brain activity, even if the initial scan was normal.- **Metabolic Workup**: Check glucose, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and ammonia levels.- **Infection Screen**: Blood cultures, lumbar puncture (if not done).- **Genetic/Epilepsy Evaluation**: If initial tests are inconclusive.2. **Seek a Second Opinion**:- Request consultation with another pediatric neurologist or a neonatal intensive care specialist, especially if seizures persist or worsen.3. **Monitor Closely**:- Track seizure characteristics (duration, triggers, movements) and report changes to the care team.4. **Address Concerns with the Care Team**:- Ask for a detailed explanation of the diagnosis, including how maternal stress could plausibly cause delayed seizures. Request documentation of the rationale.### Addressing Skepticism About the Hospital:- While hospitals prioritize patient safety, miscommunication or defensive practices can occur. Encourage the family to focus on the baby\u2019s needs rather than potential liability issues. A second opinion can provide clarity and ensure all bases are covered.### Conclusion:The neurologist\u2019s explanation is not consistent with typical neonatal seizure etiologies. While the normal initial tests are reassuring, the recurrence of seizures warrants further investigation. The family should persist in seeking comprehensive testing to rule out serious underlying conditions. Trust in medical professionals is important, but advocating for thorough care is equally critical."

        "question": "So I'm an 18 yr old Caucasian male (62kg,180cm). Since some months ago, I have constant depersonalization/dereaalization and periods of confusion that really bother me. I went to a neurologist and had an MRI scan(which turned out fine, except for some normal anatomical variants) and I was wondering if my confusion and dpdr can be the result of epilepsy ?(non-convulsive seizures). Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you're experiencing\u2014constant depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) and periods of confusion\u2014could theoretically be linked to non-convulsive seizures, but several factors should be considered:1. **Epilepsy Considerations**:- Non-convulsive seizures (e.g., focal impaired awareness seizures) can manifest as confusion, staring spells, or dissociative symptoms like DPDR. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in particular, may involve unusual sensory or emotional experiences.- However, seizures are typically **episodic** (occurring in discrete episodes) rather than constant. Persistent symptoms over months are less characteristic of typical epilepsy but might suggest rare conditions like non-convulsive status epilepticus (prolonged seizure activity), which would usually involve worsening or fluctuating symptoms.- A normal MRI does not rule out epilepsy, as many forms (e.g., idiopathic generalized epilepsy) lack structural abnormalities. An **EEG** (electroencephalogram) is the next diagnostic step to detect abnormal electrical activity.2. **Non-Epilepsy Causes**:- **Anxiety/Stress**: DPDR is strongly associated with anxiety, panic disorders, or trauma. Chronic stress can perpetuate these symptoms.- **Dissociative Disorders**: Primary DPDR disorder is a possibility, often triggered by psychological stressors.- **Other Medical Causes**: Thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12), sleep disturbances, or migraines could contribute to confusion or dissociation.3. **Next Steps**:- **Neurological Workup**: Discuss an EEG with your neurologist to evaluate for epileptiform activity. If normal, epilepsy becomes less likely.- **Psychological Evaluation**: A mental health professional can assess for anxiety, dissociative disorders, or trauma-related causes. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is often effective for DPDR.- **General Medical Screening**: Blood tests (thyroid, vitamins, metabolic panel) may help exclude other contributors.4. **Reassurance**:- A normal MRI is reassuring for the absence of structural brain lesions. Anatomical variants noted are typically incidental and unrelated to symptoms.In summary, while epilepsy cannot be entirely ruled out without an EEG, the persistent nature of your symptoms leans toward psychological or stress-related causes. Collaboration between neurology and mental health professionals is key to a comprehensive approach. Prioritize discussing an EEG and exploring psychological support to address potential anxiety or dissociation."

        "answer": "The complex presentation of this 31-year-old female with multi-system involvement suggests an underlying autoimmune or hematologic disorder. Below is a structured analysis of potential diagnoses and recommended evaluations:### **Key Considerations & Differential Diagnoses**1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with Secondary Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**- **Rationale**: Positive ANA (rising titer), Raynaud\u2019s, renal involvement (GFR fluctuations), neurologic deficits (seizures, stroke-like events), and clotting/bruising. APS could explain clots, miscarriage history, and neurologic symptoms.- **Testing**: Repeat lupus serology (anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anti-RNP), complement levels (C3/C4), and APS markers (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, \u03b22-glycoprotein I antibodies).2. **Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**- **Rationale**: Recurrent clots, post-partum hemorrhage, stroke-like symptoms (foot drop, eye palsy), and livedo reticularis (implied by bruising).- **Testing**: Triple APS antibody panel and exclusion of malignancy/other hypercoagulable states.3. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TTP/HUS)**- **Rationale**: Anemia, renal dysfunction, neurologic symptoms (seizures, vision changes).- **Testing**: ADAMTS13 activity, peripheral smear for schistocytes, LDH, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte count.4. **Autoimmune Hepatitis or Tubulointerstitial Nephritis**- **Rationale**: Hypokalemia (renal wasting), elevated MCH (possible hemolysis), and fluctuating GFR.- **Testing**: Liver function tests, urine electrolytes, kidney biopsy if renal dysfunction persists.5. **Vasculitis (e.g., Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**- **Rationale**: Multi-organ involvement (renal, neurologic, joint swelling).- **Testing**: ANCA antibodies, CRP/ESR, imaging (CT/MRI angiography).6. **Genetic/Channelopathies**- **Rationale**: Seizures, hypokalemia, and neuropathy.- **Testing**: Consider genetic testing for Gitelman/Bartter syndrome or mitochondrial disorders if autoimmune workup is negative.---### **Additional Workup Recommendations**- **Hematologic**: Evaluate for hemolytic anemia (reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, LDH). Check B12/folate to rule out macrocytic anemia.- **Neurologic**: EEG for seizure characterization; consider lumbar puncture if CNS inflammation is suspected.- **Renal**: Urinalysis for proteinuria/hematuria, 24-hour urine protein, and renal ultrasound.- **Imaging**: Repeat brain MRI with contrast for subtle lesions; consider MRA for vasculitis.- **Endocrine**: Assess adrenal function (cortisol/ACTH) given hypokalemia and hypoglycemia.---### **Interdisciplinary Management**- **Rheumatology**: For autoimmune/vasculitis evaluation and immunosuppressive therapy if indicated.- **Hematology**: To address clotting disorders, anemia, and rule out TTP.- **Neurology**: For seizure management and stroke-like event investigation.- **Nephrology**: For renal function monitoring and biopsy if needed.---### **Conclusion**The most likely unifying diagnosis is **SLE with secondary APS**, given the multi-system involvement, rising ANA, and thrombotic events. However, TTP and vasculitis remain critical exclusions. Immediate priority is ruling out life-threatening conditions (e.g., TTP) and initiating targeted autoimmune testing. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is essential for accurate diagnosis and management."

        "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your mother's situation is complex, and several factors could contribute to the increased absence seizures. Here\u2019s a structured approach to consider:### 1. **Medication Review**- **Drug Levels & Interactions**:- Check serum levels of Keppra (levetiracetam) and Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) to ensure therapeutic dosing. Trileptal can induce liver enzymes, potentially lowering efficacy of other medications (e.g., blood pressure/cholesterol drugs) or vice versa. Conversely, other medications might affect AED levels.- **Generic Variability**: If she switched to generic brands in India, differences in bioavailability could impact seizure control. Confirm consistency in medication brands post-travel.- **Tolerance/Resistance**: Long-term AED use can sometimes lead to reduced efficacy. Discuss with her neurologist whether dose adjustments, alternative AEDs (e.g., lamotrigine, zonisamide), or adjunct therapies (e.g., brivaracetam) are needed.### 2. **Diagnostic Reevaluation**- **EEG & MRI**:- An updated EEG can identify changes in brain activity (e.g., focal vs. generalized seizures). Lip smacking suggests temporal lobe involvement (focal impaired awareness seizures), which may require different treatment.- A brain MRI can rule out new structural abnormalities (e.g., tumors, vascular issues, hippocampal sclerosis).- **Metabolic/Hormonal Workup**:- Check electrolytes, glucose, liver/kidney function, and thyroid levels.- Consider perimenopausal hormonal shifts, which can lower seizure thresholds. Hormone replacement therapy (if applicable) should be reviewed.### 3. **Psychological & Social Factors**- **Stress Management**: Stress exacerbates seizures via cortisol release. Therapy (CBT, mindfulness) and social support (community groups, virtual family connections) could help.- **Mood Disorders**: Screen for anxiety/depression, which are common in epilepsy and may require psychiatric input (e.g., SSRIs, which are generally safe with AEDs).### 4. **Lifestyle & Safety**- **Sleep Hygiene**: Prioritize regular sleep schedules, as disrupted sleep lowers seizure thresholds.- **Diet**: Explore a modified ketogenic diet (under supervision) for refractory epilepsy. Ensure vitamin D/B12 levels are adequate, especially if dietary habits changed in India.- **Safety Modifications**:- Avoid sharp objects/stoves during high-risk periods.- Use seizure alarms or wearables (e.g., Embrace2 watch) for monitoring.### 5. **Specialist Referrals**- **Epileptologist**: A neurologist specializing in epilepsy can optimize treatment and explore advanced options (e.g., VNS, RNS, or CBD oil in refractory cases).- **Multidisciplinary Team**: Include a neuropsychologist (for cognitive impacts), occupational therapist (safety planning), and social worker (addressing isolation).### 6. **Alternative Approaches**- **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)**: For drug-resistant epilepsy.- **Clinical Trials**: Investigational therapies may be available through epilepsy centers.### Next Steps:- Schedule urgent neurology/epileptology consultation.- Request AED levels, EEG, and MRI.- Document seizure frequency/triggers in a diary (timing, stressors, aura details).- Address isolation via community engagement or telehealth family interactions.This multifaceted approach balances medical, psychological, and lifestyle strategies to improve her quality of life. Early intervention is key to preventing further escalation. \ud83c\udf1f Let me know if you need help locating resources in your area!"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your intense and persistent cravings for acidic foods like vinegar, lemons, and tomatoes are intriguing and could hint at underlying factors worth exploring. Here's a structured breakdown of potential causes and recommendations:### **Potential Causes to Consider**1. **Nutrient Deficiencies**- **Iron Deficiency**: Cravings for acidic foods (like vinegar) are sometimes linked to low iron levels. Acidic foods enhance iron absorption, so your body might instinctively seek them out. Iron deficiency can also contribute to low white blood cell counts (WBC).- **Zinc or B12 Deficiency**: These deficiencies may alter taste perception or trigger cravings, though this is less directly tied to acidic foods.2. **Gastrointestinal Factors**- **Low Stomach Acid (Hypochlorhydria)**: Your body might crave acid to compensate for inadequate stomach acid, aiding digestion. This could occur even without overt symptoms like heartburn.- **Helicobacter pylori Infection**: This stomach bacteria can disrupt acid balance and has been anecdotally linked to vinegar cravings.3. **Medication Side Effects**- **Verapamil**: While primarily used for heart rate and blood pressure control, it\u2019s worth checking if it affects nutrient absorption (e.g., iron or zinc).4. **Hormonal or Neurological Factors**- **Migraine Prodrome**: Some individuals crave specific foods (including acidic ones) before a migraine, though your cravings seem chronic rather than episodic.- **Sensory Preference/Habit**: A longstanding habit or heightened sensory preference for acidic tastes, possibly rooted in childhood.5. **Autoimmune or Chronic Conditions**- Low WBC counts could suggest immune dysregulation (e.g., autoimmune issues), which might indirectly influence cravings, though this is speculative.### **Recommendations**1. **Blood Tests**- Check **iron studies** (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC) to rule out deficiency.- Test **B12, folate, and zinc levels** to assess for other deficiencies.- Re-evaluate **CBC with differential** to clarify the cause of low WBC.2. **Gastrointestinal Evaluation**- Consider testing for **H. pylori** (via breath test or stool antigen) if deficiencies are ruled out.- Discuss symptoms like reflux or indigestion with a gastroenterologist, even if mild.3. **Medication Review**- Consult your doctor about whether verapamil could contribute to nutrient malabsorption or interact with dietary habits.4. **Monitor and Document**- Track cravings alongside menstrual cycles, migraines, or alcohol use to identify patterns.- Note any digestive symptoms (e.g., bloating, discomfort) that might suggest low stomach acid.### **Conclusion**While your cravings may simply reflect a strong sensory preference, their intensity and persistence warrant ruling out deficiencies or GI issues. Given your low WBC and cardiac history, a thorough workup is prudent. If all tests are normal, the cravings may be benign, but it\u2019s wise to address any potential gaps in nutrition or digestion.If you proceed with testing, share the results with your healthcare provider to tailor next steps. In the meantime, enjoy your acidic treats in moderation to avoid enamel erosion or stomach irritation! \ud83c\udf4b\ud83e\udd52"

I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side.

Even substance-induced seizures can signal underlying neurological issues. Focal seizures or postictal states (post-seizure confusion) are possibilities.- **Non-epileptic seizures** (e.g., psychogenic) linked to stress/anxiety are also possible and require assessment.2. **Mental Health Overlap:**- Symptoms like panic, derealization/depersonalization, and prolonged distress could align with **panic attacks** or anxiety. However, seizures and mental health conditions can coexist, so both need evaluation.3. **Schizophrenia Concerns:**- Your symptoms (as described) don\u2019t strongly suggest schizophrenia, but discuss this with a doctor to rule out other conditions.### **Urgent Recommendations:**1. **Seek Medical Evaluation:**- **GP Visit:** Book an appointment with your GP immediately. Mention all past seizures and recent episodes. Request a referral to a **neurologist** (for EEG, MRI, or other tests) and a **psychiatrist** (for mental health review).- **Confidentiality:** At 19, your medical consultations are private in the UK. Doctors focus on care, not judgment.2. **Track Symptoms:**- Document episodes (triggers, duration, symptoms). Note any patterns (e.g., stress, sleep deprivation, substance use).3. **Safety Precautions:**- Avoid triggers like cannabis (lowers seizure threshold). Ensure someone nearby knows first aid for seizures (e.g., cushioning the head, timing episodes).4. **Mental Health Support:**- Discuss anxiety/depression with your GP. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or counseling might help. Crisis resources (e.g., NHS Mental Health Helpline) are available if needed.### **Reassurance:**- You\u2019re proactive in seeking answers\u2014this is crucial.

Here's a structured approach to diagnosis and management:### **Key Considerations & Differential Diagnoses**1. **Epilepsy**- **Catamenial Epilepsy**: Seizures linked to menstrual cycles due to hormonal fluctuations (estrogen lowers seizure threshold; progesterone may protect).- **Focal/Generalized Epilepsy**: Episodes of \"autopilot\" suggest absence or complex partial seizures. Video EEG is critical to confirm.- **Medication Resistance**: Current AEDs may be ineffective or inappropriate. Consider clobazam, acetazolamide, or hormonal adjuvants (e.g., progesterone) during menstrual phases.2. **Syncope & Autonomic Dysfunction**- **Cardiac Causes**: Arrhythmias (e.g., Long QT syndrome) or structural heart issues. Refer to cardiology for Holter monitor, ECG, echocardiogram.- **POTS/Dysautonomia**: Hormonal influences may exacerbate orthostatic intolerance. Tilt-table test could clarify.3. **Autoimmune/Inflammatory Conditions**- **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: Antibodies (e.g., anti-NMDA, LGI1) may cause seizures/cognitive changes. Test CSF/blood for autoantibodies.- **MS Mimics**: If MRI lacks typical lesions, consider NMOSD or MOGAD. Repeat MRI with epilepsy protocols.4. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**- Psychological stressors may manifest as seizures. Video EEG helps differentiate from epilepsy. Psychological evaluation recommended.5. **Metabolic/Hormonal Imbalances**- Check electrolytes, glucose, thyroid, B12, and iron. Track menstrual cycles for hormonal patterns (e.g., progesterone deficiency).### **Next Steps for Diagnosis**1. **Video EEG Monitoring**: Capture episodes to distinguish epileptic vs. non-epileptic events.2. **Cardiology Workup**: Rule out arrhythmias/structural heart disease.3. **Hormonal/Metabolic Testing**: Assess estrogen/progesterone levels, thyroid function, and nutritional deficiencies.4. **Autoimmune Panel**: Include anti-neuronal antibodies in blood/CSF.5. **Advanced Imaging**: Repeat MRI with epilepsy protocol (e.g., temporal lobe focus) or functional imaging (SPECT/PET).### **Immediate Management**- **Safety Measures**: Helmets, supervised showers, avoid driving/high-risk activities.- **Medication Review**: Optimize AEDs for catamenial patterns (e.g., lorazepam during menstruation). Consider hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone).- **Multidisciplinary Care**: Involve epilepsy specialists, endocrinologists, and cardiologists. Referral to a tertiary epilepsy center if unclear.### **Psychological & Social Support**- Address PNES if suspected with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).- Support groups for chronic illness to mitigate job/quality-of-life impacts.### **Summary**Prioritize video EEG and cardiac evaluation. Explore hormonal/metabolic links and autoimmune causes. Safety and specialist referrals are paramount.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's important to address your new symptoms systematically, as they could stem from several potential causes. Here's a structured approach to consider:### 1. **Medication Considerations**- **Keppra Side Effects**: While fatigue/drowsiness is a known side effect, sudden worsening after years of stability is unusual. However, late-onset or cumulative effects are possible. Rarely, mood or cognitive changes (e.g., \"brain tripping\") may occur.- **Tolerance**: Keppra tolerance is uncommon, but breakthrough seizures can happen. Subtle symptoms (e.g., dizziness, \"melting\" sensations) might indicate atypical seizure activity (e.g., absence or myoclonic seizures without physical jerks).- **Action**: Consult your neurologist to discuss Keppra levels (via blood tests) or a dose adjustment. Do not stop Keppra abruptly.### 2. **Possible Breakthrough Seizures**- Your dizziness/\u201cmelting\u201d sensation could resemble auras or non-motor seizures. JME typically involves generalized seizures, but atypical presentations occur.- **Action**: An EEG may detect subclinical seizure activity. Track symptom frequency/duration to share with your doctor.### 3. **Other Medical Causes**- **Metabolic/Endocrine**: Thyroid dysfunction, anemia, vitamin deficiencies (B12, D), or electrolyte imbalances can cause fatigue/dizziness.- **Orthostatic Hypotension**: A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing (check by comparing sitting/standing blood pressure).- **Migraine or Vestibular Issues**: Migraine aura or inner-ear disturbances (e.g., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo).- **Sleep Disorders**: Despite \"good sleep,\" consider sleep apnea or poor sleep quality (e.g., frequent awakenings).- **Pregnancy**: If applicable, hormonal changes affect medication efficacy and symptoms.- **Action**: Blood tests (CBC, thyroid, electrolytes, vitamins) and a physical exam to rule these out.### 4. **Lifestyle/Psychosocial Factors**- Stress, dietary changes, dehydration, or new medications/supplements could contribute.- **Action**: Review recent lifestyle changes and discuss with your doctor.### Next Steps:- **Immediate**: Contact your neurologist to report symptoms. Emphasize the dizziness and \"brain tripping\" sensations.- **Testing**: EEG, blood work, and possibly a sleep study or cardiac evaluation (e.g., for orthostatic hypotension).- **Monitoring**: Keep a symptom diary (timing, triggers, duration) to identify patterns.### Key Takeaway:While Keppra \u201cwearing off\u201d is unlikely, your symptoms warrant prompt evaluation to rule out breakthrough seizures, side effects, or other conditions. Early intervention can prevent complications and ensure continued seizure control."

        "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female 5,5 Ft, 160 Lbs Non smoker",

        "answer": "The complex case you describe requires a multidisciplinary approach to address potential neurological, cardiac, hormonal, and autoimmune factors. Below is a structured plan to guide further evaluation and management:---### **Key Considerations & Next Steps**1. **Reassess Epilepsy Diagnosis**:- **Video-EEG Monitoring**: Prolonged monitoring (ideally during an episode) to differentiate epileptic seizures from PNES or syncope.- **Catamenial Epilepsy**: Track episodes alongside menstrual cycles. If hormonal triggers are confirmed, consider:- **Hormonal Therapy**: Progesterone supplementation or GnRH analogs.- **AED Adjustment**: Short-term benzodiazepines (e.g., clobazam) premenstrually, or acetazolamide.2. **Cardiac Evaluation**:- **Syncope/POTS Workup**:- Tilt table test.- Holter monitor/event recorder for arrhythmias.- Electrolytes, glucose during episodes.- **Management**: If POTS is confirmed, increase fluid/salt intake, compression garments, or medications (fludrocortisone, beta-blockers).3. **Autoimmune/Inflammatory Causes**:- **MS Reassessment**:- Repeat MRI with contrast; consider spinal imaging.- Lumbar puncture for oligoclonal bands (if not done).- **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: Serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for antibodies (anti-NMDA, LGI1, etc.).4. **Hormonal & Metabolic Screening**:- Thyroid function, prolactin, PCOS markers.- Consider cyclical electrolyte imbalances (e.g., magnesium, calcium).5. **Safety & Quality of Life**:- **Fall Prevention**: Helmets, padded flooring, shower chairs.- **Memory/Autopilot Episodes**: Neuropsychological testing to rule out focal seizures or dissociative states.- **Workplace Adjustments**: Temporary disability accommodations or remote work options.6. **Referrals**:- **Epileptologist** (at a comprehensive epilepsy center).- **Cardiologist** (for syncope/POTS).- **Endocrinologist** (hormonal links).- **Psychologist/Psychiatrist** (if PNES is suspected).---### **Immediate Actions**- **Symptom Diary**: Track episodes, menstrual cycles, triggers (stress, dehydration), and medication timing.- **Medication Review**: Ensure AEDs are optimized (e.g., lamotrigine or levetiracetam for catamenial patterns).- **Emergency Plan**: Wear a medical alert bracelet; teach family seizure first aid.---### **Possible Diagnoses to Explore**- **Catamenial Epilepsy** (hormonally-triggered seizures).- **POTS/Dysautonomia** (autonomic dysfunction exacerbated by menstrual cycle).- **Autoimmune Encephalitis** (if memory loss/autopilot episodes are acute).- **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy** (focal seizures with impaired awareness).- **Migraine Variants** (e.g., basilar migraine with syncope).---### **Final Notes**This case highlights the challenge of overlapping neurological and systemic conditions. A thorough, stepwise evaluation is critical. Advocate for referrals to tertiary centers with expertise in epilepsy and autonomic disorders. Persistence in tracking symptoms and seeking second opinions can help uncover the root cause and improve her quality of life."

        "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about stopping Keppra, especially given your responsibilities caring for a newborn. Here\u2019s a structured approach to address your concerns:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Seizure Risk Post-Eclampsia:**- Your seizures were **acute**, caused by postpartum eclampsia, not epilepsy. Once blood pressure (BP) stabilizes, the risk of recurrent seizures is **very low**, provided BP remains controlled.- ACOG guidelines indicate that long-term antiepileptics like Keppra are unnecessary for eclampsia once the acute phase resolves. The drug was likely a precaution during recovery.2. **Stopping Keppra:**- **Tapering is safer**, even after short-term use (1 month). Abruptly stopping antiepileptics can rarely trigger withdrawal seizures or mood changes, even in non-epileptic patients. A typical taper might involve reducing the dose over 1\u20132 weeks (e.g., 500mg twice daily for a week, then 250mg twice daily).- **Short duration of use** may allow for a quicker taper, but this should be guided by a clinician.3. **Safety Planning:**- **Avoid being alone during the taper** if possible. Arrange for support (family, friends) to stay with you and your newborn, especially in the first few days after dose reductions.- **Monitor BP daily** to ensure stability, as hypertension is the primary risk factor for eclampsia-related seizures.4. **Next Steps:**- **Advocate for clear guidance**: If your neurologist is unresponsive, contact your OB/GYN or primary care provider. They can collaborate on a taper plan or refer you to another neurologist.- **Seek a second opinion**: A maternal-fetal medicine specialist or another neurologist may offer reassurance and address your specific postpartum context.5. **Psychological Support:**- Postpartum anxiety is common, especially after a traumatic event like eclampsia. Consider speaking to a therapist or counselor to process your experience and reduce stress.### **Summary of Recommendations:**- **Taper Keppra gradually** under medical supervision.- **Ensure BP remains controlled** with regular checks.- **Arrange support** during the taper period.- **Advocate for responsive care** by involving other providers if needed.Your proactive approach is commendable. While the likelihood of complications is low, taking these precautions can provide peace of mind as you transition off medication. Always consult your care team before making changes, but know that your concerns are valid and warrant thorough attention."

        "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your situation involves a complex interplay between vascular issues and potential seizures, necessitating careful evaluation. Here's a structured breakdown of your concerns:### 1. **Are these episodes seizures or purely vascular?**- **Current Episodes:** The \"pit of the stomach\" sensation (likely an **aura**) suggests **focal seizures**, which can originate from a brain lesion. Even if the primary issue is vascular (e.g., carotid dissection), seizures may arise if the lesion irritates brain tissue.- **Initial Attack:** The convulsions and respiratory arrest align with a **generalized tonic-clonic seizure**, possibly triggered by acute brain injury from vascular compromise (e.g., ischemia due to dissection).### 2. **Can carotid dissection/TIA cause seizures?**- **Dissection:** May lead to stroke (ischemia or hemorrhage), which can provoke **acute symptomatic seizures**. Chronic seizures (epilepsy) may develop if a scar forms.- **TIA:** Unlikely to directly cause seizures, as TIAs resolve without permanent damage. However, if there\u2019s subtle injury, seizures could occur, though this is rare.### 3. **Initial Attack Presentation**- Your symptoms (sudden loss of consciousness, convulsions) are atypical for TIA but classic for seizures. The dissection might have caused a stroke that triggered the seizure, blending vascular and epileptic mechanisms.### 4. **Will you be on seizure medications forever?**- **Short-Term:** Medications like Vimpat are used to prevent recurrent seizures while the underlying cause (e.g., dissection) is addressed.- **Long-Term:** If seizures persist after vascular treatment and no acute trigger exists, epilepsy may be diagnosed, potentially requiring long-term medication. If the vascular issue resolves and seizures stop, a neurologist may consider tapering meds.### 5. **Did you develop epilepsy at 35?**- **Epilepsy Diagnosis:** Requires \u22652 unprovoked seizures. Your initial seizure may have been \"provoked\" by the vascular event. If seizures recur without acute triggers, epilepsy could be diagnosed. The brain lesion (e.g., scar from ischemia) might serve as a seizure focus.---### Next Steps & Considerations:- **Diagnostic Cerebral Angiogram:** This will clarify the carotid dissection severity and guide treatment (e.g., anticoagulants, stenting).- **Seizure Monitoring:** Continued neurology follow-up is crucial. An EEG could help correlate your episodes with epileptic activity.- **Medication Adjustment:** Discuss Vimpat side effects with your neurologist. Alternatives like lamotrigine or brivaracetam may be better tolerated.- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Optimize blood pressure, glucose, and weight to reduce vascular risk, which may also lower seizure likelihood.### Key Takeaway:Your condition likely involves **vascular-induced seizures**. Addressing the carotid dissection may reduce seizure risk, but ongoing monitoring is essential. Collaborate closely with your neurosurgeon and neurologist to tailor treatment and potentially adjust medications over time."

I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5\u20199 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I\u2019m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don\u2019t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you're experiencing\u2014twitching in your limbs and a sensation of head shaking when pressing against your pillow\u2014are concerning but could stem from several potential causes. Here's a structured breakdown:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Medication Side Effects (Epilim/Sodium Valproate):**- Epilim is known to cause tremors or myoclonus (sudden muscle jerks) in some individuals. Though rare, these side effects can occur even at therapeutic doses. A neurologist may check your medication levels or adjust your regimen if needed.2. **Stress/Anxiety-Related Fasciculations:**- Stress is a common trigger for benign muscle twitching (benign fasciculation syndrome). Your doctors\u2019 initial assessment aligns with this, especially if blood tests (electrolytes, thyroid, vitamins like B12/D) and physical exams were normal.3. **Neurological Causes:**- **Seizure Activity:** While your history is of absence seizures, new focal twitching could indicate evolving seizure types (e.g., myoclonic or focal motor seizures). An EEG would help rule this out.- **Myoclonus:** Sudden, brief muscle jerks that can occur in epilepsy patients, either as part of the disorder or due to medication.- **Other Rare Causes:** Conditions like ALS are extremely unlikely given your age, lack of weakness/atrophy, and the presence of a known seizure disorder.4. **Physiological Factors:**- The head-shaking sensation when pressing into the pillow might be a heightened awareness of normal physiological tremors due to pressure or altered proprioception (your body\u2019s sense of position).### **Recommended Steps:**- **Neurologist Evaluation:** Essential to rule out seizure progression, medication effects, or other neurological issues. They may perform:- **EEG:** To detect abnormal brain activity.- **EMG/Nerve Conduction Studies:** To assess muscle and nerve function if fasciculations persist.- **Blood Tests:** To check electrolytes, liver/kidney function, and vitamin levels.- **Symptom Monitoring:**- Track the frequency, triggers, and locations of twitching. Note any weakness, sensory changes, or worsening symptoms.- **Stress Management:**- Techniques like mindfulness, adequate sleep, and hydration may reduce stress-related twitching.- **Medication Review:**- Ensure Epilim levels are within the therapeutic range. Discuss any concerns about side effects with your neurologist.### **Reassuring Factors:**- Absence of \"red flags\" like muscle weakness, atrophy, or coordination issues.- Benign fasciculations are common and often stress-related, especially in young, otherwise healthy individuals.### **When to Seek Immediate Care:**- Sudden worsening, loss of consciousness, or new neurological deficits (e.g., slurred speech, vision changes).Hang in there until your neurology appointment. Stress can exacerbate symptoms, so try to stay proactive with self-care while awaiting further evaluation."

        "answer": "The episode you experienced, often referred to as fainting (syncope) with possible myoclonic jerks, could stem from several factors. Here's a structured breakdown of potential causes and recommendations:### **Possible Causes:**1. **Vasovagal Syncope:**- Triggered by stress, heat, sudden posture changes, or dehydration. Exiting the pool (temperature shift) may have caused a sudden drop in blood pressure/heart rate, leading to fainting. Involuntary movements (\"flopping\") can occur during syncope.2. **Orthostatic Hypotension:**- Rapid standing after sitting/lying down (e.g., getting out of the pool) can cause blood pressure drops. Your height/weight (tall, lean build) may increase susceptibility.3. **Cannabis Effects:**- THC can lower blood pressure, especially when combined with heat, dehydration, or physical exertion. Even frequent users can have variable reactions depending on dose, environment, or hydration.4. **Dehydration/Overheating:**- Swimming masks dehydration symptoms. Dehydration reduces blood volume, exacerbating dizziness or fainting.5. **Underlying Health Concerns:**- While less likely, cardiac issues (e.g., arrhythmias) or neurological conditions (e.g., seizures) require evaluation. Syncope in young individuals, though often benign, should be medically assessed to rule out serious causes.---### **Immediate Recommendations:**1. **Consult a Healthcare Provider:**- Disclose the incident, cannabis use, and any family history of heart issues. Tests may include:- **EKG** (to check heart rhythm).- **Blood tests** (glucose, electrolytes).- **Holter monitor** (24-hour heart tracking) if arrhythmia is suspected.2. **Hydration & Environment:**- Stay hydrated, especially in heat or during physical activity. Avoid sudden posture changes after sitting/lying down.3. **Cannabis Use Considerations:**- Reflect on setting (heat, activity) and dosage. THC\u2019s impact on blood pressure can vary. Consider pausing use until medically cleared.4. **Monitor for Recurrence:**- Note any triggers (e.g., fasting, stress) if it happens again. Seek emergency care if you experience chest pain, prolonged confusion, or recurrent episodes.---### **Reassurance:**- Many syncope causes are situational and manageable. However, your age and the episode\u2019s abruptness warrant medical evaluation to ensure no underlying conditions. Honesty with your doctor is key\u2014they\u2019re there to help, not judge.Take care, and prioritize a check-up for peace of mind and safety."

        "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The incident described suggests a complex medical event involving both neurological and traumatic components. Here's a structured analysis:### Key Observations & Symptoms:1. **Pre-fall Symptoms**:- **20-second freeze**: Possible aura or focal seizure onset.- **Unilateral right-sided smile**: Suggests focal seizure activity in the left hemisphere (facial control is contralateral).- **Unnatural laughter**: Gelastic seizures, often linked to hypothalamic hamartomas or temporal lobe foci.- **Stiffening and fall**: Tonic phase of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.2. **Post-fall Symptoms**:- **Unconsciousness (5\u20137 min)**: Typical post-ictal state after a seizure.- **Foaming at the mouth**: Excessive salivation common in seizures.- **Blood from the left ear**: Likely traumatic (e.g., basal skull fracture from impact).- **Disorientation**: Post-ictal confusion.### Likely Sequence of Events:1. **Focal Onset Seizure**: Beginning with freezing (impaired awareness) and right facial twitching (focal motor activity), evolving into a gelastic seizure (laughter).2. **Secondary Generalization**: Progression to a tonic-clonic seizure, causing stiffening and fall.3. **Traumatic Injury**: Impact with the board led to a potential skull fracture (blood from the ear) and scalp abrasions.4. **Post-ictal State**: Prolonged unconsciousness, confusion, and autonomic features (foaming).### Differential Diagnoses:- **Gelastic Seizures**: Rare, laughter-like seizures often resistant to medication. Associated with hypothalamic lesions (e.g., hamartomas) or temporal lobe epilepsy.- **Symptomatic Seizure**: New-onset seizure in a 60-year-old raises suspicion for acute causes (stroke, tumor, hemorrhage, metabolic imbalance).- **Head Trauma Complication**: Fall-induced skull fracture (blood from ear) could also trigger seizures, but the timeline favors seizure-first.### Critical Considerations:- **Age Factor**: New seizures in older adults often stem from structural brain pathology (e.g., stroke, tumor) rather than idiopathic epilepsy.- **Blood from the Ear**: Basal skull fractures (e.g., temporal bone) can cause this; imaging (CT/MRI) is urgent to assess trauma and rule out hemorrhage.- **Denial of Epilepsy**: May indicate undiagnosed pathology or first-time seizure.### Immediate Steps:1. **Neuroimaging**: CT to assess fractures/bleeding; MRI for structural lesions (e.g., hamartoma, stroke).2. **EEG**: To detect epileptiform activity and localize seizure origin.3. **Metabolic Workup**: Rule out electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia, etc.4. **Neurology Consult**: For seizure management and etiology determination.### Conclusion:The event was likely a **focal seizure with gelastic features**, generalizing into a tonic-clonic seizure, followed by traumatic head injury. The underlying cause requires urgent investigation to exclude stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormalities. This is a medical emergency warranting comprehensive evaluation."

        "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The situation you're experiencing with your neurologist's prescribing practices for Lamotrigine involves a balance between medical oversight and patient safety. Here's a structured breakdown:### **1. Standard Prescribing Practices for Epilepsy Medications:**- **Regular Monitoring:** Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) like Lamotrigine often require periodic check-ups to assess efficacy, side effects, and dosage adjustments. For newly diagnosed patients (e.g., within the first 1\u20132 years), 6-month follow-ups are common to ensure stability and prevent complications (e.g., rash, mood changes, or breakthrough seizures).- **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring:** Some neurologists check blood levels of Lamotrigine to confirm therapeutic ranges, which necessitates appointments.### **2. Why Your Neurologist Might Require Appointments:**- **Safety and Liability:** Sudden discontinuation of AEDs is dangerous, but so is unsupervised long-term use. Doctors may avoid automatic refills to ensure patients attend follow-ups for safety checks.- **Regulatory or Clinic Policies:** While Lamotrigine isn\u2019t a controlled substance, some clinics enforce strict renewal policies to maintain care continuity, especially for chronic conditions.### **3. Potential Gaps in Communication:**- **Patient Responsibility:** Scheduling follow-ups proactively is critical, but clinics often send reminders. If reminders were missed, discuss this with your doctor to improve future communication.- **Contingency Planning:** Your neurologist should ideally provide guidance on emergency situations (e.g., a backup plan if you run out of medication). If not, request this during your appointment.### **4. Steps to Prevent Future Issues:**- **Schedule Appointments in Advance:** Book your next visit immediately after each appointment to avoid last-minute gaps.- **Emergency Supply:** Ask your pharmacist if they can provide a short-term emergency supply (3\u20135 days) in urgent cases, depending on local regulations.- **Clarify Prescription Policies:** During your appointment, discuss your concerns and ask if longer prescriptions (e.g., 12 months with refills) are possible once your condition is stable.### **5. Is This Approach \"Normal\"?**- Yes, for many neurologists managing epilepsy, especially early in treatment. However, inflexibility without emergency options could be improved. Advocate for a collaborative plan that ensures medication access while respecting the need for monitoring.### **Next Steps:**- **At Your Appointment:**- Explain your concerns about prescription timing and ask for clarity on renewal policies.- Request automatic reminders from the clinic for future appointments.- Discuss whether telehealth check-ins could substitute some in-person visits.### **Final Note:**Your neurologist\u2019s priority is your safety, but patient advocacy is key. Open dialogue can help align their monitoring needs with your access to medication. If barriers persist, consider seeking a second opinion or a neurologist with more flexible follow-up protocols."

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to feel concerned about your symptoms and their impact on your life. Here's a structured response to your situation:1. **Medication Timeline and Adjustment**:- Carbamazepine (Zeptol) typically requires several weeks to reach therapeutic levels. While you may not notice immediate improvements, it\u2019s important to follow your neurologist\u2019s dosing plan and allow time for the medication to take effect. Blood tests to monitor drug levels or adjust dosages may be necessary.2. **Memory and Seizure Control**:- Memory issues in epilepsy can stem from seizure activity affecting the hippocampus. Controlling seizures may help improve cognitive function. If seizures have caused structural damage (e.g., hippocampal sclerosis), further evaluation (MRI) would clarify this. However, many patients experience cognitive improvement once seizures are controlled.3. **Alzheimer\u2019s Concerns**:- Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s in your 30s is exceedingly rare. Your symptoms are more likely tied to epilepsy or post-seizure effects rather than a neurodegenerative condition. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate memory problems, so addressing mental health is crucial.4. **Diagnostic Follow-Up**:- Ensure you\u2019ve undergone imaging (MRI) and EEG to rule out structural causes or confirm seizure focus. These tests guide treatment and prognosis.5. **Lifestyle and Support**:- Consider stress management techniques (mindfulness, therapy) and workplace accommodations. Occupational therapy or counseling might help adapt to cognitive challenges.6. **Next Steps with Your Neurologist**:- Discuss:- Timeline for reassessing medication efficacy.- Possible alternatives if Carbamazepine isn\u2019t effective.- Role of adjunct therapies (e.g., memory aids, cognitive rehab).- Reviewing MRI/EEG results if available.**Reassurance**: Many epilepsy-related cognitive issues improve with seizure control. While permanent damage is possible, it\u2019s not guaranteed. Stay proactive with your care team and prioritize follow-ups. Your current focus should be on stabilizing seizures and managing stress\u2014this is a marathon, not a sprint. You\u2019re not alone in this journey."

        "question": " Yet another EDIT: I fainted today on my way to the store and was brought into the hospital. They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \\\"silent\\\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder. Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.",

        "answer": "It sounds like you've been through an incredibly challenging time, but I'm glad you're getting some answers. Your experiences are valid, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let\u2019s break this down:### Key Points & Next Steps:1. **Silent Seizures**:- These could be *absence seizures* (brief loss of awareness) or *focal impaired awareness seizures* (subtle changes in consciousness). The term \"brain zaps\" might align with sudden, brief disruptions in brain activity.- **Action**: Work closely with a neurologist to confirm the type and tailor treatment (e.g., medication, lifestyle adjustments). Prioritizing sleep and stress management is critical, as these are known triggers.2. **Gastroparesis**:- This condition delays stomach emptying, causing nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.- **Action**: The gastric emptying study will clarify this. Meanwhile, a dietitian can help you adapt to smaller, low-fiber/low-fat meals and soft foods. Staying hydrated is key.3. **Mental Health & Anxiety**:- Chronic health issues and anxiety often interplay. Lack of sleep exacerbates both seizures and GI problems.- **Action**: Consider therapy (e.g., CBT) or mindfulness techniques to manage stress. Your care team may connect you with resources.### Reassurance:- You\u2019re **not \u201cinsane\u201d**\u2014your symptoms have tangible medical explanations. Gastroparesis and seizures are documented conditions, and treatment plans can significantly improve quality of life.- **Advocate for yourself**: Keep a symptom journal (seizure triggers, food reactions) to share with your doctors. Ask questions during your appointments.### Final Thoughts:You\u2019re already taking the right steps by pursuing testing and specialist care. This is a lot to process, but with a structured plan, support, and time, things can improve. Be patient with yourself, and lean on your care team\u2014they\u2019re there to help you navigate this. \ud83d\udc9bLet me know if you need help parsing any medical terms or just want to vent. You\u2019re not alone in this!"

I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn\u2019t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can\u2019t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure. I have had no history of seizures before. I am so scared to sleep right now fearing that something might happen. It\u2019s probably about a year that this situation while i am trying to sleep happens. Wold really love to have an EEG bit when i went to the neurologist a year ago he only diagnosed me with anxiety combined with elements of OCD.

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, here's a structured and organized summary of potential considerations and recommendations:### **Medical Considerations:**1. **Neurological Symptoms:**- **Deja Vu & Dream Flashbacks:** While these can occur in temporal lobe epilepsy, they are also common in healthy individuals. The absence of seizure history and a normal neurological exam (reflexes, eyesight) are reassuring.- **Nocturnal Vibrations/Buzzing:** Could relate to anxiety-induced hypervigilance, sleep-onset phenomena (e.g., hypnic jerks), or restless legs syndrome. Less likely to indicate seizures without other hallmark symptoms (e.g., loss of consciousness, rhythmic movements).2. **Cardiac & Sensory Symptoms:**- **Rapid Heart Rate/Depersonalization:** Suggestive of panic attacks or anxiety. Hyperventilation can cause tingling, dizziness, and palpitations.- **Head/Ear Buzzing:** May be stress-related tinnitus or somatic manifestations of anxiety.3. **Psychiatric Factors:**- **Anxiety & OCD:** The neurologist\u2019s diagnosis aligns with health-focused anxiety/OCD, which can amplify physical sensations and catastrophic thinking.- **Illness Anxiety Disorder:** Preoccupation with severe illnesses (e.g., brain tumors, epilepsy) despite medical reassurance.---### **Recommendations:**1. **Medical Evaluation:**- **EEG:** Consider discussing this with a neurologist to rule out epileptiform activity, especially if symptoms worsen or new red flags emerge (e.g., loss of consciousness, focal weakness).- **Sleep Study:** If sleep disturbances persist, evaluate for disorders like insomnia or parasomnias.2. **Mental Health Support:**- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Effective for health anxiety and OCD, helping reframe catastrophic thoughts and reduce reassurance-seeking behaviors.- **Medication:** SSRIs may be beneficial if anxiety/OCD significantly impairs daily functioning. Discuss with a psychiatrist.3. **Lifestyle Adjustments:**- **Sleep Hygiene:** Regular sleep schedule, screen-free wind-down routine, and avoiding stimulants (caffeine, nicotine).- **Stress Management:** Mindfulness, yoga, or breathing exercises to reduce hypervigilance.4. **Symptom Tracking:**- Keep a journal documenting symptoms, triggers, and timing. This can clarify patterns and provide objective data for healthcare providers.5. **Family Communication:**- Open dialogue with parents about concerns, emphasizing the need to balance medical evaluation with addressing anxiety.---### **Reassurance:**- The chronicity of symptoms (1 year) without progression to seizures or neurological deficits is reassuring.- Anxiety can manifest physically, and treatment often leads to significant improvement.**Next Steps:** Schedule a follow-up with a neurologist or primary care provider to revisit testing options, and seek a therapist specializing in anxiety/OCD. Addressing mental health is key to breaking the cycle of fear and physical symptoms."

        "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3\u2019s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "### **Step-by-Step Advice and Recommendations**1. **Immediate Medical Concerns:**- **Ovarian Torsion:** This remains a critical concern. Return to the ER, ideally at a hospital where your surgical specialist practices or one familiar with endometriosis. Emphasize that Zofran masks vomiting, making it an unreliable exclusion criterion. Demand urgent imaging (CT/MRI or repeat ultrasound with Doppler to assess blood flow to the ovary).- **Advocacy:** Bring a written summary of your medical history, medications, and previous ER findings. If possible, have a friend or family member advocate for you. Mention your scheduled hysterectomy and ask if the surgeon can be consulted emergently.2. **Pain Management:**- **Non-Opioid Options:**- Rotate **Toradol** (if tolerated with gastroparesis) and **acetaminophen (Tylenol)**. Avoid NSAIDs if gastroparesis symptoms worsen.- Use heat therapy (heating pads) and gentle movement (e.g., pelvic tilts) to alleviate muscle tension.- **Opioid Caution:** Minimize Tylenol 3 use. Discuss alternatives like a short-course nerve block or IV Toradol with providers. Ask about **low-dose naltrexone (LDN)** for chronic pain, though this may require specialist input.3. **Seizure Risk Mitigation:**- Ensure strict adherence to **Keppra** and **lamotrigine**. Monitor for signs of breakthrough seizures (e.g., auras, mood changes).- Stress reduction: Prioritize rest, hydration, and avoid known triggers (e.g., missed meals, sleep deprivation).4. **Surgeon and Specialist Communication:**- Contact your excision specialist **immediately**. They may expedite surgery if torsion or a complex cyst is suspected.- Request a pre-op consult to discuss moving up your hysterectomy date given acute deterioration.5. **Bridge Care Until September:**- **Walk-In Clinics/Telehealth:** Use Ontario\u2019s Telehealth (1-866-797-0000) or a walk-in clinic to request interim support (e.g., anti-spasmodics like Buscopan for cramping, gabapentin for neuropathic pain).- **Pharmacist Consultation:** Discuss interactions between current medications (e.g., Toradol + lamotrigine) and safe OTC options.6. **GI and Dietary Considerations:**- **Celiac Testing:** Push for testing once stable, as untreated celiac can exacerbate pain and malabsorption.- **Gastroparesis-Friendly Diet:** Small, low-fiber, low-residue meals to reduce GI strain. Avoid opioids, which worsen motility.7. **Mental Health and Support:**- Seek counseling or peer support (e.g., **Endometriosis Network Canada**). Chronic pain and medical trauma require emotional care.- Document all symptoms and provider interactions for future appointments.8. **Action Plan if Pain Worsens:**- Return to ER with explicit demands: \u201cI need imaging to rule out ovarian torsion. I cannot vomit due to Zofran, and my pain is unmanageable.\u201d- If dismissed, ask for a senior physician or patient advocate.### **Key Takeaways**- **Prioritize ruling out torsion** with imaging and specialist input.- **Limit opioids** using scheduled non-narcotics and adjuvant therapies.- **Leverage advocacy** to navigate dismissive care\u2014persistently assert your needs.- **Expedite surgical planning** to address the root cause (endo, PCOS, adhesions).You\u2019re navigating an incredibly challenging situation, but your proactive approach and self-advocacy are vital. Keep pushing for the care you deserve. \ud83d\udc9b"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The sudden onset of seizures in a young adult with normal imaging and EEG is challenging, but several factors and considerations may help guide further investigation:### **1. Medication-Related Factors**- **Montelukast (Singulair):** This asthma/allergy medication carries a black box warning for neuropsychiatric effects (e.g., agitation, depression, hallucinations). Rare case reports link it to seizures. A trial discontinuation (if asthma/allergies permit) could be explored under medical supervision.- **Adderall (stimulant):** May lower the seizure threshold, especially with irregular sleep patterns or inconsistent dosing. Review timing/dosing and assess sleep hygiene.- **Zoloft (SSRI):** Generally safe in epilepsy, but high doses or interactions (e.g., with Adderall) could theoretically increase risk. Check for serotonin syndrome signs (unlikely at current doses).### **2. Substance Use**- **THC (weed):** Effects on seizures are mixed. While CBD is anticonvulsant, THC may be pro-convulsant in some individuals. Consider reducing use to assess impact.- **Vaping:** Nicotine and additives (e.g., propylene glycol) may have neurotoxic effects. Switching to FDA-approved nicotine replacement (if needed) or cessation could be prudent.### **3. Underlying Medical Causes**- **Autoimmune encephalitis:** Anti-NMDA receptor or other autoimmune encephalitides can present with seizures and normal initial testing. Consider CSF analysis or autoimmune panels.- **Genetic epilepsy:** Some genetic forms (e.g., PRRT2, SCN1A) may not show EEG/MRI abnormalities. Genetic testing or consultation with a neurogenetics specialist could be helpful.- **Metabolic deficiencies:** Check vitamin D, B12, magnesium, and electrolytes, even if initial bloodwork was normal.### **4. Lifestyle & Comorbidities**- **Sleep disruption:** Adderall use or anxiety may interfere with sleep, a known seizure trigger. A sleep study or strict sleep hygiene may help.- **Stress/anxiety:** Both MDD and GAD can lower the seizure threshold. Integrate stress-reduction techniques (e.g., mindfulness, therapy).### **5. Diagnostic Next Steps**- **Extended EEG monitoring:** Ambulatory or inpatient video EEG to capture events.- **Repeat imaging:** Consider a high-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocols (e.g., 3T MRI, focused on mesial temporal lobes).- **Keppra adjustment:** 500mg BID is a low dose; escalation or adding a second ASM (e.g., lamotrigine, which also treats mood) might be warranted.### **6. Practical Management**- **Driving restrictions:** Ensure compliance with state laws (typically 6 months seizure-free).- **Safety measures:** Discuss seizure first aid with family/roommates, avoid high-risk activities (e.g., swimming alone).- **Epilepsy specialist referral:** For refractory cases or atypical presentations.### **Key Questions for Your Care Team**- Could Singulair or other medications contribute?- Is autoimmune or genetic testing appropriate?- Would a Keppra dose increase or adjunctive therapy help?- Can we rule out PNES with video EEG?While the lack of answers is frustrating, a systematic approach targeting modifiable factors (medications, substances, sleep) and advanced testing (genetic/autoimmune workup) may uncover clues. Collaborate closely with a neurologist, ideally an epileptologist, to tailor next steps. \ud83c\udf1f"

        "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

        "answer": "The recurrence of seizures in your father with advanced cirrhosis is a complex issue, likely influenced by multiple factors related to his liver disease and medical history. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and Xifaxan Cessation:**- **Role of Xifaxan (rifaximin):** It reduces gut ammonia production, a key driver of HE. Stopping it may worsen HE, though seizures are not a typical symptom. However, severe HE can lower the seizure threshold indirectly via metabolic disturbances (e.g., ammonia-induced brain edema, electrolyte imbalances).- **Cognitive Symptoms:** His preserved cognitive functions (crosswords, piano) suggest mild HE, but short-term memory loss and lack of insight align with early HE. Consider whether lactulose (a standard HE treatment) is part of his regimen, as its absence could exacerbate HE if Xifaxan is stopped.2. **Electrolyte Imbalances:**- **Hyponatremia (low sodium):** Common in cirrhosis due to fluid retention/diuretics (e.g., spironolactone). Sodium fluctuations can trigger seizures. His recent salt tablet use and GP advice to stop may indicate unstable sodium levels.- **Other Electrolytes:** Potassium/magnesium imbalances from diuretics or liver dysfunction could contribute.3. **Alcohol Use:**- **Withdrawal vs. Toxicity:** Even reduced alcohol intake (a few beers nightly) might lead to intermittent withdrawal or direct neurotoxicity. Both can lower seizure thresholds.4. **Past Brain Injury:**- The 1971 motorbike accident could have caused structural brain changes (e.g., scar tissue), predisposing him to late-onset epilepsy. An MRI will help evaluate this.5. **Medications:**- **Mirtazapine:** Rarely lowers seizure thresholds, but consider this if other triggers are ruled out.- **Keppra (levetiracetam):** Newly prescribed; ensure adherence and monitor efficacy.### **Recommendations:**1. **Urgent Evaluation:**- **MRI Brain:** To rule out structural causes (e.g., old trauma, tumors, stroke).- **Ammonia Levels:** Check if HE is contributing (though levels don\u2019t always correlate with symptoms).- **Electrolytes:** Monitor sodium, potassium, and magnesium closely.2. **HE Management:**- Reintroduce **Xifaxan** if possible, paired with **lactulose** (if not already used) to reduce ammonia. Discuss alternatives if side effects (diarrhea) are intolerable.- **Dietary Adjustments:** Reduce protein intake if excessive, and consider probiotics for gut health.3. **Seizure Control:**- Optimize **Keppra** dosing. If seizures persist, other antiepileptics (e.g., lamotrigine) may be considered, avoiding hepatotoxic options (e.g., valproate).4. **Alcohol and Medications:**- **Alcohol Cessation:** Reinforce support for reducing/stopping alcohol to slow liver decline and stabilize neurology.- **Review Medications:** Assess diuretics (spironolactone) for electrolyte impact and Mirtazapine for seizure risk.5. **Palliative Care Discussion:**- Given his advanced cirrhosis and autonomy concerns, involve a palliative care team to align treatment with his quality-of-life goals.### **Prognosis and Realities:**- **Risk of Decline:** Recurrent seizures and HE in advanced cirrhosis indicate high mortality risk. Prepare for progressive complications (coma, infections, variceal bleeding).- **Respect Autonomy:** His refusal of medications/alcohol cessation requires balancing medical advice with his preferences. Open, compassionate dialogue about his goals is critical.### **Conclusion:**While Xifaxan cessation may indirectly contribute to seizures via HE exacerbation, the etiology is likely multifactorial. A comprehensive workup (MRI, labs) and multidisciplinary care (hepatology, neurology, palliative) are essential. Support his autonomy while ensuring he understands the risks of non-compliance."

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

        "answer": "Your situation is complex and requires a multifaceted approach. Here's a structured plan to address your concerns:### 1. **Immediate Medical Reevaluation**- **Neurologist Consultation:**- Discuss the ineffectiveness of oxcarbazepine and explore alternative anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) such as lamotrigine or levetiracetam.- Request a **video EEG** to capture current episodes and confirm the epilepsy diagnosis or rule out non-epileptic events.- Consider a **serum drug level test** if restarting oxcarbazepine, to check for adequate dosing or metabolism issues.- **Gastroenterologist Referral:**- Address lingering acid reflux and gut health, possibly linked to H. pylori treatment. Investigate microbiome health and nutrient absorption (e.g., magnesium, B12).### 2. **Dietary and Metabolic Management**- **Strict Keto Adherence:** Reinstate ketosis with careful monitoring. Consult a dietitian specializing in epilepsy to optimize your diet.- **Electrolyte Balance:** Ensure adequate intake of sodium, potassium, and magnesium, crucial for neurological function and keto adaptation.- **Food Diary:** Track intake to identify hidden triggers (e.g., specific carbs, additives) and consider alternatives like the modified Atkins diet if keto is unsustainable.### 3. **Testing and Diagnostics**- **Nutrient Deficiency Panel:** Check for deficiencies (magnesium, B vitamins) exacerbated by PPIs/antibiotics.- **MRI Scan:** Rule out structural brain changes since your initial diagnosis.- **Gut Microbiome Analysis:** Explore dysbiosis from antibiotics, which may affect the gut-brain axis.### 4. **Lifestyle and Psychological Support**- **Stress Management:** Incorporate mindfulness, yoga, or meditation to lower seizure triggers.- **Therapy:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help manage seizure-related anxiety and improve social engagement.- **Support Groups:** Connect with others managing epilepsy for shared strategies and emotional support.### 5. **Long-Term Strategies**- **Medication Trial:** If diet alone is insufficient, work with your neurologist to test new AEDs, weighing benefits vs. side effects.- **Holistic Care:** Integrate neurology, gastroenterology, and nutrition expertise for a coordinated plan.- **Work Flexibility:** Explore remote or flexible self-employment options to reduce stress while managing symptoms.### Key Questions for Your Doctors:- Could gut health changes from antibiotics/PPIs be influencing my seizures?- Are there AEDs with fewer side effects that could complement my diet?- Should we investigate non-epileptic causes for recent symptoms?### Final Notes:Your proactive approach with keto and lifestyle changes is commendable. However, the recurrence of severe symptoms suggests a need for medical reinforcement. Prioritize a thorough reevaluation to tailor a sustainable plan, balancing diet, medication, and mental health. Stay hopeful\u2014many with refractory epilepsy find stability through personalized strategies.Let me know how your next steps unfold!"

        "question": "I took my epilepsy meds about 1.5h ago, Divalproex Sodium 250mg. I want to take a regular Gravol (not nighttime) so I can get to sleep earlier. I know it's not the best sleep aid but I don't have anything else at home currently and I want to fix my awful schedule.I read something about diphenhydramine triggering seizures but I'm not sure how similar it is to dimenhydrinate which is in Gravol so I'm a little worried as I haven't had one in years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering using Gravol (dimenhydrinate) to aid sleep while on Divalproex Sodium for epilepsy, here's a structured summary of key points and recommendations:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Gravol Composition**:- Contains **dimenhydrinate**, a combination of **diphenhydramine** (an antihistamine with sedative effects) and **8-chlorotheophylline** (a mild stimulant).- Each Gravol tablet typically has ~25 mg diphenhydramine (lower than standalone sleep aids, which often use 25\u201350 mg).2. **Seizure Risk**:- Diphenhydramine *can* lower the seizure threshold in sensitive individuals, particularly at higher doses. While Gravol\u2019s dose is lower, caution is still warranted for those with epilepsy, even if well-controlled.3. **Drug Interactions**:- **Divalproex Sodium**: No major pharmacokinetic interactions expected, but combining sedatives may increase drowsiness or dizziness.- **CNS Effects**: Both drugs can cause sedation; combined use may intensify this effect.### **Recommendations**:1. **Consult Your Healthcare Provider First**:- Essential to confirm safety with your neurologist or pharmacist, given your epilepsy history and current medication.2. **Non-Pharmacological Alternatives**:- Prioritize sleep hygiene: consistent bedtime, dark/quiet environment, avoid screens before bed, and relaxation techniques (e.g., meditation).3. **If Using Gravol**:- **Lowest Effective Dose**: Start with half a tablet (12.5 mg diphenhydramine) to minimize risks.- **Monitor Closely**: Watch for unusual drowsiness, dizziness, or seizure activity. Avoid alcohol or other sedatives.4. **Alternatives to Consider**:- **Melatonin** (short-term use, 0.5\u20135 mg) is generally safer for sleep in epilepsy, though availability may vary.- Discuss prescription sleep aids (e.g., trazodone) with your doctor if insomnia persists.### **Bottom Line**:While Gravol\u2019s diphenhydramine content poses a *theoretical* risk, the actual risk at low doses may be small if your seizures are well-controlled. However, **medical guidance is crucial** to weigh benefits vs. risks. Avoid long-term use and explore sustainable sleep adjustments.**When in doubt, contact your care team before proceeding.**"

        "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the details provided, here's a structured response to your concerns:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Possible Causes of the Rash:**- **Allergic Contact Dermatitis:** Likely due to substances used during IV placement (e.g., antiseptics like chlorhexidine, adhesive tapes, or latex in gloves). The delayed onset (5 days post-IV) aligns with a hypersensitivity reaction.- **Medication Reaction:** Less likely, as oral medications (gabapentin, celecoxib, cyclobenzaprine) typically cause systemic rashes. However, notify your doctor about these rashes to rule out drug interactions.- **Infection (Less Likely):** Uncommon at two separate IV sites, but monitor for warmth, pus, or fever.2. **Red Flags to Watch For:**- Spreading redness, fever, swelling, or pain.- Systemic symptoms (e.g., hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing) \u2013 seek emergency care immediately.### **Recommended Actions:**- **Home Remedies:**- **Topical Treatment:** Apply OTC hydrocortisone cream 1% to reduce itching/inflammation.- **Oral Antihistamines:** Try cetirizine (Zyrtec) or loratadine (Claritin) for daytime relief, or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at night.- **Cold Compress:** Use a clean cloth with ice to soothe itching (10-15 minutes at a time).- **Avoid Scratching:** Prevent secondary infection by keeping the area clean and covered if needed.- **When to Contact a Doctor:**- **Urgently:** If redness spreads, rash blisters, or you develop fever/chills.- **Within 24\u201348 Hours:** Even if mild, inform your surgeon or primary care provider. They may assess for infection/allergy, especially given recent surgeries and medications.### **Why Consult a Doctor?**- Your surgical recovery and existing medications (e.g., gabapentin, NSAIDs) warrant caution. Allergic reactions can escalate, and ruling out infection is critical post-surgery.### **Final Note:**While these rashes may resolve with OTC care, proactive communication with your healthcare team is advised. They can evaluate whether a medication adjustment or further treatment (e.g., antibiotics for infection) is needed.Let me know if you need help drafting a message to your doctor!"

Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The clinical scenario presented raises several considerations for differential diagnosis, assessment tools, and next steps. Here's a structured analysis:---### **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**1. **Neurodegenerative Dementias**- **Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD):**- Early-onset AD (despite no family history) could present with progressive memory loss and later language/executive deficits. Communication difficulties (e.g., word-finding issues) may suggest **logopenic primary progressive aphasia** (often AD pathology).- **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD):**- **Behavioral variant FTD:** Executive dysfunction (overwhelm with multitasking) and preserved memory early on.- **Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA):** Expressive language deficits (e.g., non-fluent or logopenic variants) with intact comprehension align with her communication difficulties.- **Lewy Body Dementia (LBD):** Less likely without core features (fluctuations, parkinsonism, hallucinations).2. **Psychiatric Contributions**- **Depressive Pseudodementia:** Depression can impair concentration and memory. However, her symptoms persist despite psychiatric care, suggesting possible comorbid neurodegenerative pathology.- **Interaction:** Depression may exacerbate or unmask early dementia.3. **Vascular Cognitive Impairment:**- Possible if vascular risk factors exist (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but no history of stroke/TIA is noted. Executive dysfunction (e.g., multitasking issues) can occur.4. **Other Considerations**- **Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy/NPH:** Unlikely without relevant history (head trauma, gait/urinary symptoms).- **Reversible Causes:** Hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency (excluded per question, but clinically essential to rule out).---### **Role of Screening Tools**1. **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE):**- **Strengths:** Screens orientation, memory, attention, language, and visuospatial skills. Scores <24/30 suggest impairment.- **Limitations:** Less sensitive for early/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or non-amnestic dementias (e.g., FTD). Misses executive dysfunction.2. **Clock-Drawing Test:**- **Strengths:** Assesses visuospatial skills, planning, and executive function. Abnormalities may indicate parietal lobe (AD) or frontal lobe (FTD/vascular) dysfunction.- **Limitations:** Not diagnostic alone; requires context (e.g., depression may impair performance).3. **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA):**- More sensitive than MMSE for MCI and frontal/executive deficits (e.g., scoring multitasking, abstraction).---### **Clinical Recommendations**1. **Comprehensive Neuropsychological Testing:** Evaluates memory, language, executive function, and visuospatial skills in detail. Critical for distinguishing FTD, AD, and psychiatric etiologies.2. **Psychiatric Reassessment:** Ensure depression is optimally managed; consider therapy/medication adjustments.3. **Neurological Referral:** For specialized evaluation (e.g., cortical atrophy patterns on MRI, FDG-PET for hypometabolism patterns).4. **Monitor Progression:** Track symptom evolution (e.g., language decline in PPA vs. memory decline in AD).---### **Key Takeaways**- Her history suggests a possible neurodegenerative process (e.g., early AD or FTD) complicated by depression.- MMSE and clock test are useful screening tools but insufficient for definitive diagnosis.- A multimodal approach (neuroimaging, neuropsych testing, longitudinal follow-up) is essential to clarify the etiology.Early intervention (e.g., cognitive rehabilitation, lifestyle modifications) and accurate diagnosis are critical for prognosis and management."

Here\u2019s a structured summary of potential causes and next steps:### **Key Considerations**1. **Polycythemia Vera (PV):**- A myeloproliferative neoplasm where the bone marrow overproduces red blood cells.- **Red Flags:** Itching after hot showers (classic in PV), night sweats, and elevated blood counts.- **Testing Needed:**- *JAK2 V617F mutation test* (present in ~95% of PV cases).- *Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level* (low/normal in PV, elevated in secondary polycythemia).- Consultation with a **hematologist** for evaluation.2. **Secondary Polycythemia:**- Caused by factors like chronic hypoxia (e.g., sleep apnea, lung disease), smoking, high altitude, or EPO-secreting tumors.- **Action Steps:**- Rule out hypoxia with a **pulse oximetry** or **sleep study** (if snoring/sleep disruptions occur).- Assess for kidney/liver tumors (via imaging) if EPO is elevated.- Review medications (though Lamictal is not commonly linked to polycythemia).3. **Dehydration:**- Temporary elevation in blood counts due to reduced plasma volume.- **Action:** Confirm with a repeat CBC after ensuring adequate hydration.4. **Other Symptoms:**- **Night Sweats:** Consider infections (TB, HIV), hormonal changes, or malignancies.- **Fatigue:** Likely multifactorial (low vitamin D, poor sleep, or polycythemia-related hyperviscosity).- **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Supplementation may help fatigue but won\u2019t resolve blood count issues.### **Next Steps**- **Immediate:**- Repeat CBC to confirm results.- Check EPO level and JAK2 mutation.- Evaluate for hypoxia (e.g., sleep study, chest X-ray).- **Symptom Management:**- Address low vitamin D with supplements.- Optimize sleep hygiene to improve fatigue.- **Specialist Referral:**- Hematologist for potential PV workup.- Consider pulmonologist or endocrinologist if secondary causes are suspected.### **When to Seek Urgent Care**- If symptoms worsen (e.g., severe headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or chest pain), seek immediate care, as these could indicate complications of hyperviscosity (e.g., blood clots).### **Final Note**Your symptoms and lab results should not be ignored. While some causes are benign (e.g., dehydration), others like PV require prompt diagnosis and management (e.g., phlebotomy, medications). Follow up with your doctor to prioritize these tests and rule out serious conditions."

        "answer": "The individual's complex medical history and symptoms suggest a multifaceted neurological and possibly systemic condition. Here's a structured approach to understanding and addressing her concerns:### Key Considerations & Recommendations:1. **Epilepsy & Suspected Seizures:**- **EEG Limitations:** A normal EEG doesn't rule out epilepsy, as seizures may not be captured during testing. Consider prolonged video-EEG monitoring to correlate clinical episodes with electrical brain activity.- **Vimpat Trial:** The new prescription (Vimpat) is reasonable to address potential breakthrough seizures. Monitor for efficacy and side effects.2. **Narcolepsy & Cataplexy:**- **Xyrem vs. Ambien:** Transitioning from Xyrem (sodium oxybate) to Ambien may affect symptom control. Xyrem treats both narcolepsy and cataplexy, while Ambien primarily aids sleep. Re-evaluate sleep architecture and cataplexy triggers with a sleep specialist.3. **Autonomic Dysfunction:**- **Raynaud\u2019s, Erythromelalgia, & Small Fiber Neuropathy:** These suggest autonomic/sensory nerve involvement. Evaluate for small fiber neuropathy via skin biopsy and autonomic testing (tilt table, sweat tests).- **Pins/Needles & Internal Tremors:** Could reflect dysautonomia or neuropathy. Consider autoimmune panels (e.g., ANA, anti-SSA/SSB, paraneoplastic antibodies) and consult a neuroimmunologist.4. **Unilateral Nasal Drainage:**- **Postnasal Drip vs. CSF Leak:** If unilateral and persistent, rule out CSF leak with beta-2 transferrin testing of nasal fluid. Imaging (MRI brain) may help exclude structural causes.5. **Episodic Confusion & Language Issues:**- **Temporal Lobe Seizures:** Inability to read or process language may indicate focal seizures. Neuropsychological testing and advanced imaging (e.g., MRI with epilepsy protocol) could localize abnormalities.- **Panic vs. Neurological Events:** Differentiate panic attacks (e.g., with HR monitoring, cortisol levels) from seizure/aura activity.6. **Muscle Symptoms & Spasms:**- **Myoclonus vs. Cataplexy:** Distinguish between myoclonic jerks (possible seizure-related) and cataplexy triggers (emotional stimuli). EMG/nerve conduction studies may clarify.7. **Urge Incontinence:**- **Neurogenic Bladder:** Assess with urodynamic studies given history of constipation and possible autonomic involvement.8. **Medication Interactions:**- **CNS-Acting Drugs:** Ambien, Nuvigil, and Vimpat may interact or exacerbate symptoms (e.g., sedation, tremors). Review with a pharmacist/neurologist.### Next Steps:- **Multidisciplinary Care:** Involve a neurologist (preferably with epilepsy/autonomic expertise), sleep specialist, and possibly a rheumatologist.- **Advanced Testing:**- MRI brain/spine to exclude structural lesions.- Autonomic function testing and skin biopsy for small fiber neuropathy.- Lumbar puncture if autoimmune encephalitis is suspected.- **Lifestyle & Symptom Tracking:** Maintain exercise routine but note triggers. Use a symptom diary to correlate episodes with potential causes (stress, medications, activity).### Conclusion:This presentation may indicate an underlying autoimmune, genetic, or channelopathy-related disorder. A systematic, collaborative approach is essential to unravel the interplay between her diagnoses and symptoms, ensuring both symptomatic relief and targeted investigation of root causes."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The combination of your MRI findings, clinical history, and symptoms suggests a complex interplay of factors that may contribute to your current condition. Here's a breakdown of key points and potential next steps:---### **Key Findings & Interpretation**1. **Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOC) vs. Hippocampal Volume**:- **Normal hippocampal volume (72nd percentile)** suggests no significant atrophy of the hippocampus itself.- **Low HOC (32nd percentile)** likely reflects enlargement of the adjacent **superior lateral ventricles (94th percentile)**, which may compress or alter the spatial relationship of the hippocampus within the temporal lobe. This could impair hippocampal function despite preserved volume.2. **Enlarged Ventricles**:- Ventricular enlargement often indicates reduced brain volume (atrophy) or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Given your age, atrophy is less likely unless driven by inflammation, autoimmune processes, or epilepsy-related changes.3. **Clinical Context**:- **Post-COVID/Vaccine Reaction**: Both COVID-19 and rare vaccine reactions (e.g., inflammation, autoimmunity) can trigger neuropsychiatric symptoms. Mechanisms may include:- **Neuroinflammation** affecting the hippocampus or limbic system.- **Autoimmune encephalitis** (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor antibodies).- **Epilepsy**: Seizures or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) like Trileptal rarely cause structural changes but may contribute to cognitive symptoms.- **CBD Oil**: Prior depersonalization/amnesia suggests sensitivity to cannabinoids, but effects are typically transient unless there\u2019s underlying vulnerability.---### **Potential Causes to Investigate**- **Neuroinflammation/Autoimmunity**:- Post-COVID or post-vaccine inflammatory syndromes (e.g., \"long COVID,\" autoimmune encephalitis).- Tests: CSF analysis (autoantibodies, oligoclonal bands), blood tests (anti-neuronal antibodies, inflammatory markers).- **Limbic Dysfunction**:- Hippocampal compression or functional disruption from ventricular enlargement.- **Psychiatric Comorbidity**:- Depression and depersonalization can worsen cognitive symptoms; may overlap with organic causes.- **Epilepsy-Related Factors**:- Seizure activity, AED side effects, or subtle structural changes linked to epilepsy.---### **Prognosis & Next Steps**1. **Diagnostic Workup**:- **Neurological evaluation**: Rule out autoimmune encephalitis (lumbar puncture, antibody panels) or ongoing inflammation (MRI with contrast, PET scan).- **Neuropsychological testing**: Differentiate between organic vs. functional cognitive impairment.- **Cardiac/autonomic testing**: If fatigue or \"reduced consciousness\" suggests dysautonomia (common in long COVID).2. **Treatment Considerations**:- **Immunotherapy**: If autoimmunity is confirmed (steroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis).- **Neuroprotection/Symptom Management**:- Cognitive rehabilitation for memory.- Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) for mood/depersonalization (caution with epilepsy).- **Long COVID Clinics**: Specialized multidisciplinary care.3. **Prognosis**:- **Reversible causes** (e.g., inflammation): Likely improvement with targeted therapy.- **Structural changes** (e.g., ventricular enlargement): Symptoms may stabilize but require adaptive strategies.- **Functional/psychiatric components**: Often respond to therapy (CBT, mindfulness) and medication.---### **Takeaway**Your case highlights overlapping contributors: post-COVID/vaccine effects, epilepsy, and psychiatric history. The low HOC likely reflects ventricular enlargement compressing hippocampal space, which could disrupt function despite normal volume. Prognosis hinges on identifying treatable causes (e.g., inflammation) and managing symptoms holistically. Early intervention for autoimmune or inflammatory processes offers the best chance of improvement. Collaborate closely with a neurologist (ideally specializing in autoimmune or post-COVID conditions) and a psychiatrist to tailor care."

The J&J vaccine is the only adenovirus option available in the U.S.- **mRNA Vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna)**: Extensive data shows **no significant link to GBS**, with rates similar to background population levels. These are generally preferred for individuals concerned about GBS.2. **Epilepsy-Specific Considerations**:- **Medications (Keppra/Lamictal)**: No known interactions between COVID vaccines and antiseizure medications.- **Post-Vaccine Monitoring**: Fever, a common side effect, can lower the seizure threshold. Manage with acetaminophen (if approved by your neurologist) and stay hydrated.3. **Risk-Benefit Analysis**:- **COVID-19 Infection Risks**: Higher likelihood of severe illness (especially with obesity) and neurological complications (including seizures and GBS) compared to vaccination.- **Vaccine Benefits**: Strong protection against hospitalization/death, which helps avoid disruptions to seizure control.4. **Recommendations**:- **Preferred Choice**: Opt for **mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna)** due to lower GBS risk and robust efficacy.- **Consult Your Care Team**: Discuss concerns with your neurologist/primary provider, emphasizing your history of vaccine hesitancy related to GBS.5. **Post-Vaccine Steps**:- Monitor for side effects (e.g., fever, fatigue) and report any unusual neurological symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, tingling) promptly.**Conclusion**: While GBS is rare, mRNA vaccines offer the safest profile for your concerns. Vaccination remains critical given the risks posed by COVID-19 itself. Always personalize decisions with your healthcare provider.*Sources: CDC, WHO, and peer-reviewed studies (e.g., JAMA, NEJM).*"

        "answer": "The complexity of your symptoms suggests a multifactorial condition that may require a multidisciplinary approach. Here\u2019s a structured plan to explore potential causes and next steps:### **1. Expanded Diagnostic Workup**- **Metabolic Myopathies**:- Genetic testing for disorders like McArdle disease, mitochondrial disorders, or lipid storage diseases.- Consider a muscle biopsy to assess for enzyme deficiencies or mitochondrial dysfunction.- Exercise stress tests with lactate/ammonia monitoring to identify metabolic blockages.- **Autoimmune/Rheumatologic Causes**:- Myositis-specific antibodies (anti-Jo1, Mi-2, SRP) to rule out polymyositis/dermatomyositis.- Anti-AChR/MuSK antibodies for myasthenia gravis (if weakness fluctuates).- Paraneoplastic panels (if malignancy is suspected).- **Small Fiber Neuropathy**:- Skin biopsy to confirm neuropathy, which could explain burning pain and autonomic symptoms (e.g., heat intolerance).- **Autonomic Dysfunction**:- Tilt-table test for POTS/dysautonomia.- Thermoregulatory sweat test to evaluate autonomic control of sweating.- **Infectious Diseases**:- Confirmatory Lyme testing (Western blot) and co-infections (Babesia, Ehrlichia).- Viral serologies (e.g., HIV, EBV) or persistent viral myositis.- **Endocrine Evaluation**:- Thyroid function (TSH, free T4), cortisol/ACTH, and pituitary hormones to rule out adrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction.### **2. Immediate Next Steps**- **Neuromuscular Specialist Referral**: For advanced EMG/NCS and guidance on muscle biopsy or genetic testing.- **Rheumatology Consultation**: To explore autoimmune myopathies or systemic inflammation.- **Metabolic Disease Clinic**: For specialized testing (e.g., fasting protocols, genetic panels).### **3. Symptom & Trigger Management**- **Heat Intolerance**: Cooling vests, hydration, and environmental modifications.- **Exercise**: Work with a physical therapist to design a regimen that avoids triggering rhabdomyolysis (e.g., low-intensity, frequent rests).- **Neuropathic Pain**: Trial of gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine for burning sensations.### **4. Medication Review**- Assess for medications/supplements that may exacerbate rhabdomyolysis (statins, certain antibiotics, antipsychotics).### **5. Monitoring & Follow-Up**- **CK Tracking**: Regular monitoring during symptomatic flares.- **Advanced Imaging**: Consider muscle MRI or FDG-PET to detect inflammation if myositis is suspected.- **Lumbar Puncture**: If MS remains a concern despite normal MRIs (e.g., CSF oligoclonal bands).### **6. Patient Advocacy**- **Symptom Diary**: Track flares, triggers (heat, exercise, diet), and CK levels.- **Multidisciplinary Coordination**: Ensure communication between neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, and other specialists.### **Potential Diagnoses to Consider**- **Metabolic Myopathy** (e.g., mitochondrial disorder, McArdle disease).- **Autoimmune Myositis** or **Dysautonomia** (e.g., POTS, autonomic neuropathy).- **Channelopathy** (e.g., periodic paralysis, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility).- **Late-Stage Lyme Disease** or **Post-Infectious Autoimmunity**.By systematically addressing these areas, you may identify underlying triggers and tailor treatment. Persist in advocating for referrals to specialists who can delve deeper into less common causes."

        "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",

        "answer": "**Empathy and Validation:**Experiencing seizures can be frightening and disorienting, especially with memory gaps and the emotional toll of feeling ashamed or frustrated. Your feelings are completely valid, and it\u2019s brave to seek clarity during such uncertainty.**Medical Considerations:**1. **Diagnostic Clarity:**- Epilepsy and vasovagal syncope (fainting) can mimic each other. Key differences include:- **Epileptic seizures:** Often involve rhythmic jerking, loss of awareness, and post-episode confusion.- **Vasovagal episodes:** Typically triggered by stress/pain, preceded by dizziness/nausea, and involve brief loss of consciousness (with possible brief jerking).- Your episodes (e.g., post-seizure confusion, occurrence during sleep) may align more with epilepsy, but further testing is critical.2. **Seek a Second Opinion:**- Request a referral to a **neurologist specializing in epilepsy**. Ask about:- **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To detect abnormal brain activity.- **MRI/CT scans:** To rule out structural causes (e.g., tumors, scars).- **Detailed history:** Share specifics of both episodes (triggers, duration, recovery).3. **Medication Concerns:**- **Lamictal (lamotrigine):** While memory issues are a known side effect, stopping abruptly risks breakthrough seizures.- **Discuss alternatives:** If side effects are intolerable, a neurologist might adjust your dose or switch medications (e.g., levetiracetam, valproate). Never stop without medical guidance.**Emotional and Practical Support:**- **Confidential Support:** Consider joining anonymous epilepsy support groups (e.g., Epilepsy Foundation forums) to connect with others.- **Mental Health:** Counseling can help process feelings of shame or anxiety. Many hospitals in Hong Kong offer psychosocial services.**Next Steps:**- **Document episodes:** Keep a seizure diary (triggers, symptoms, duration).- **Advocate for clarity:** Push for thorough testing to confirm/refute the diagnosis. Misdiagnosis *is* possible, but evidence-based evaluation is key.**Remember:** Your safety and long-term health come first. While Lamictal may feel burdensome now, collaboration with a trusted neurologist can help balance seizure control and quality of life. You\u2019re not alone in this journey. \ud83c\udf1f"

        "question": "24 F USA Asthma, epilepsy, hypothyroidismI have laryngeal candidiasis (unknown cause but thought to be from Breo and prednisone?) and it isn't responding much to fluconazole. The next step is amphotericin b and I'm kinda nervous. What should I expect realistically?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "**Amphotericin B for Laryngeal Candidiasis: What to Expect**You\u2019re facing a challenging situation, but understanding the next steps can help ease your concerns. Here\u2019s a realistic overview of what to expect with amphotericin B:### 1. **Administration**- **Formulation**: Amphotericin B may be given intravenously (IV) for systemic treatment, especially if the infection is severe or resistant. Lipid-based formulations (e.g., liposomal amphotericin) are often preferred for better tolerability.- **Topical Options**: In some cases, an oral suspension (swish-and-swallow) might be used for localized throat involvement, though systemic treatment is more common if fluconazole failed.### 2. **Side Effects**- **Infusion Reactions (IV)**: Fever, chills, nausea, or headaches during the first doses. These are manageable with premedication (e.g., acetaminophen, antihistamines, or steroids).- **Kidney Monitoring**: Conventional amphotericin can affect kidney function. Your team will monitor creatinine and electrolytes closely. Lipid formulations reduce this risk.- **Electrolyte Imbalances**: Potassium and magnesium levels may drop, requiring supplements.### 3. **Effectiveness**- Amphotericin B is potent against resistant Candida. Improvement in symptoms (pain, swallowing difficulty) may occur within days, but treatment typically lasts 1\u20132 weeks, adjusted based on response.### 4. **Preventive & Supportive Measures**- **Steroid Use**: Your doctors may review inhaled/oral steroid doses to reduce immune suppression. Use a spacer with your inhaler and rinse your mouth after each use to prevent recurrence.- **Drug Interactions**: Amphotericin has fewer interactions than azoles, but inform your team about all medications (especially epilepsy drugs).### 5. **Reassurance**- Your team will prioritize safety (e.g., choosing lipid formulations, premedication). Speak up about side effects\u2014they\u2019re manageable!### 6. **Long-Term Considerations**- Address underlying risks (e.g., immune status, steroid use). Follow up to ensure the infection resolves and prevent future episodes.**Takeaway**: While amphotericin B has risks, it\u2019s a critical tool for resistant infections. Your healthcare team will tailor the approach to balance efficacy and safety. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask them questions about your specific treatment plan!"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you describe\u2014nocturnal episodes with cramps, breathing difficulties, unusual noises, and post-event amnesia\u2014suggest a potential neurological or sleep-related disorder. Here's a structured approach to understanding and addressing your condition:### Possible Conditions to Consider:1. **Epilepsy**:- **Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE)**: Characterized by sudden, brief seizures during sleep, often with vocalizations, thrashing, or dystonic postures. It may mimic parasomnias but is distinguishable via EEG.- **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy**: Less likely due to motor symptoms, but still possible.2. **Sleep Disorders**:- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)**: Breathing interruptions and choking sounds could align with OSA, but typically lacks seizure-like movements. A sleep study can rule this out.- **Parasomnias (e.g., Sleep Terrors, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder)**: These involve unusual behaviors during sleep but usually without true seizures.3. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**: Stress-related episodes that mimic seizures but require psychological evaluation. However, your partial response to antiseizure medications makes this less likely.### Essential Diagnostic Steps:- **Video-EEG Monitoring**: Captures brain activity during episodes to confirm epilepsy or rule out PNES.- **Polysomnography (Sleep Study)**: Assesses for sleep apnea, parasomnias, or seizure activity.- **MRI Brain Scan**: Checks for structural abnormalities (e.g., tumors, lesions).- **Blood Tests**: To exclude metabolic imbalances or substance interactions.### Lifestyle & Medication Considerations:- **Substance Use**:- **Cannabis/LSD**: May lower seizure thresholds or interact unpredictably with medications like Levetiracetam. Discuss use with your neurologist.- **Alcohol/Tobacco**: Can disrupt sleep architecture and exacerbate seizures. Reducing intake may help.- **Medication Adjustment**: If Levetiracetam is only partially effective, explore other anticonvulsants (e.g., Lamotrigine, Brivaracetam) or combination therapy.### Immediate Actions:1. **Consult a Specialist**: Seek an epileptologist or sleep medicine neurologist for advanced evaluation.2. **Safety Measures**: Use padded bed rails, avoid sleeping alone if possible, and maintain a regular sleep schedule.3. **Track Episodes**: Document frequency, duration, and potential triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, substance use) with your girlfriend\u2019s help.### Reassurance for Your Girlfriend:- Educate her on first aid during seizures (e.g., positioning you on your side, timing episodes, avoiding restraint).- Counseling or support groups may alleviate her anxiety.### Final Note:Persist in pursuing a definitive diagnosis. Undiagnosed nocturnal seizures can pose risks, and tailored treatment is crucial. Your proactive approach\u2014combining medical follow-up, lifestyle adjustments, and symptom tracking\u2014is key to managing this condition effectively."

        "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \\\"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\\\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The episodes described in your boyfriend's case likely represent a combination of panic-induced syncope (fainting) with convulsive activity, possibly triggered by his severe needle phobia and anxiety. Here's a structured breakdown of the situation and recommendations:### **Key Considerations & Probable Diagnosis**1. **Vasovagal Syncope with Convulsive Activity**:- **Triggers**: Needles/medical procedures are classic vasovagal triggers. Anxiety can amplify this response.- **Mechanism**: Panic \u2192 adrenaline surge \u2192 sudden vasovagal response (drop in heart rate/blood pressure) \u2192 reduced cerebral blood flow \u2192 syncope (fainting). Myoclonic jerks (\"shaking\") can occur during cerebral hypoperfusion.- **Cyanosis (Purple Face)**: May result from breath-holding or irregular breathing during the episode, leading to temporary hypoxia.2. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**:- Less likely if true loss of consciousness occurs, but PNES can mimic seizures without EEG abnormalities. Episodes are often linked to psychological distress.### **Critical Steps for Management**1. **Medical Evaluation**:- **Tilt Table Test**: To confirm vasovagal syncope.- **Video-EEG Monitoring**: During an episode to rule out PNES or epilepsy definitively.- **Cardiac Workup**: Ensure no arrhythmias or structural heart issues (though likely normal given prior tests).2. **Therapeutic Interventions**:- **Exposure Therapy (Systematic Desensitization)**:- Gradual, controlled exposure to needles/medical settings with a therapist.- Incorporate relaxation techniques (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing) during exposure.- **Applied Tension Technique**:- Teach muscle tensing (e.g., legs, abdomen) to stabilize blood pressure during prodromal syncope symptoms.- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Enhancement**:- Address catastrophic thoughts about medical procedures. Focus on trauma-informed care if past trauma exists.3. **Medication Options**:- **SSRIs/SNRIs**: For underlying anxiety/depression (e.g., sertraline, venlafaxine). Non-injectable forms preferred.- **Acute Anxiolytics**: Low-dose benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) for procedural anxiety (short-term use to avoid dependency).4. **Safety During Episodes**:- Position him supine with legs elevated to improve cerebral blood flow.- Ensure a safe environment to prevent injury during shaking.- Reassurance post-episode; most episodes resolve spontaneously.5. **Collaborative Care**:- **Medical Alert Bracelet**: Indicates syncope risk and needle phobia for emergency responders.- **Crisis Plan**: Develop with a therapist/doctor for hospital visits (e.g., pre-medication for blood draws).### **Addressing Barriers**- **Needle Phobia**: Advocate for accommodations (e.g., numbing cream, hidden needles, distraction techniques).- **Medication Hesitancy**: Explore liquid or oral formulations if fear of injections complicates treatment.### **Conclusion**Your boyfriend\u2019s episodes likely stem from a vasovagal response exacerbated by panic. A combination of targeted therapy, physiological strategies (applied tension), and judicious medication can reduce frequency/severity. Collaborative care with a neurologist, psychiatrist, and therapist specializing in anxiety disorders is ideal. Immediate next steps include confirming the diagnosis with a tilt test or video-EEG and initiating exposure therapy."

        "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you're experiencing\u2014brain zaps, body shocks, tongue numbness\u2014warrant a thorough evaluation, but several factors should be considered:### 1. **Medication (Strattera)**- **Withdrawal/Inconsistency:** Though Strattera (atomoxetine) is an NRI (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and not typically linked to \"brain zaps,\" inconsistent dosing could disrupt neurotransmitter balance. Sudden changes might trigger atypical withdrawal-like symptoms, even if rare.- **Side Effects:** Rare neurological side effects (e.g., paresthesia, tremors) could occur. Discuss timing of symptoms relative to dosing with your psychiatrist.### 2. **Neurological Considerations**- **Seizure Activity:** The spread of symptoms (brain \u2192 body \u2192 tongue) and numbness could suggest focal seizures. While non-epileptic seizures are part of your history, an EEG may help rule out epileptic activity.- **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** Stress/anxiety (common in OCD) might manifest as physical symptoms. FND can coexist with non-epileptic seizures.### 3. **Sleep-Related Phenomena**- **Hypnagogic Sensations:** Intense sensory experiences during sleep transitions (e.g., exploding head syndrome) can mimic shocks. However, numbness is less typical.### 4. **Additional Factors**- **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Low magnesium, B12, or electrolytes could exacerbate neurological symptoms. Consider bloodwork.- **Hormonal/Stress Triggers:** Hormonal fluctuations (e.g., menstrual cycle) or heightened stress may interact with neurochemistry.### Next Steps:- **MRI:** Rule out structural causes (e.g., lesions, vascular issues). Even if past imaging was normal, changes over 7 years are possible.- **Neurology Consultation:** Request an EEG to assess for seizure activity and review your history of non-epileptic seizures.- **Medication Review:** Consult a psychiatrist to discuss Strattera\u2019s role, potential alternatives, or a tapering schedule if needed.- **Symptom Diary:** Track timing, triggers, and associated factors (stress, sleep quality, diet).### Reassurance:While alarming, these symptoms are more likely functional or medication-related than life-threatening. However, prioritize the MRI and specialist input to exclude serious causes. If imaging is normal, focus shifts to neuropsychiatric evaluation and symptom management.**Advocate for a multidisciplinary approach (neurologist, psychiatrist, primary care) to address both organic and functional contributors.**"

I have ADHD, Panic attacks and Anxiety Disorder problems and even normal MRI is killing me inside why am i having those jerks!?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about your symptoms, but let's break down the key points to provide clarity and guidance:### 1. **Normal MRI \u2260 No Epilepsy**- **Myoclonic Epilepsy**: This is diagnosed primarily through clinical history and **EEG** (electroencephalogram), not MRI. A normal MRI rules out structural causes (e.g., tumors, lesions) but doesn\u2019t exclude epilepsy, which involves electrical activity. Ask your doctor about an EEG if you haven\u2019t had one yet.### 2. **Medication Considerations**- **ADHD Stimulants**: Drugs like methylphenidate or amphetamines can sometimes trigger or worsen tics/jerks. Review your medications with your doctor to rule out side effects or interactions.- **Thyroid/Blood Sugar**: Ensure your hypothyroidism and pre-diabetes are well-managed. Severe thyroid dysfunction or hypoglycemia can rarely cause muscle symptoms, but this is less likely if labs are stable.### 3. **Anxiety and Stress**- **Psychogenic Jerks**: Stress, panic attacks, and anxiety can manifest physically as muscle twitches or jerks (sometimes called \"functional movements\"). These are not epileptic but may require stress-reduction strategies (e.g., therapy, mindfulness).- **Cycle of Worry**: Health anxiety can amplify physical symptoms. Consider therapy (e.g., CBT) to address anxiety related to your symptoms.### 4. **Next Steps**- **Neurologist Follow-Up**: Seek a neurologist specializing in epilepsy or movement disorders. They may recommend:- **EEG** to assess for epileptic activity.- **Video Monitoring** to capture episodes.- **Medication Adjustment**: If myoclonic epilepsy is suspected, anticonvulsants like levetiracetam or valproate might be options.- **Mental Health Support**: Address anxiety with a psychiatrist or therapist. Techniques like relaxation training or SSRIs (for anxiety) may help.### 5. **Reassurance**- A normal MRI is a **positive sign** that there\u2019s no structural brain abnormality. Many causes of jerks (e.g., stress, benign myoclonus) are manageable and not dangerous.### Key Takeaway:Collaborate closely with your neurologist and mental health team. Focus on ruling out epilepsy with an EEG, optimizing stress management, and reviewing medications. Your symptoms may improve with a combination of neurological care and anxiety treatment. You\u2019re not alone\u2014many people with similar conditions find relief with the right approach."

I don't know how much that is but it felt like a \\\"large swallow\\\". Maybe as much as the max daily dosage of 120mL. That was all I had for at least 24 hours in either direction.I don't think I feel any symptoms different than what I usually feel. I read that toxicity can cause confusion and ringing in the ears. But I always seem to have ringing in the ears from time to time, and I have epilepsy so I'm always a little tired and confused (I take carbamazapine 300mg 2x).How concerned should I be? 28 year old white male. About 160lbs and 5'6",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your situation, here's a concise assessment and recommendations:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Pepto-Bismol Dosage:**- **Active Ingredient:** Bismuth subsalicylate (converts to salicylate in the body).- **Your Intake:** Up to 120mL (if \"Max\" is the same concentration as regular Pepto, this equals ~1,036mg salicylate).- **Toxicity Threshold:** Severe toxicity typically occurs at >10g salicylate (your dose is well below this). However, sensitivity varies.2. **Symptoms & Timing:**- Salicylate toxicity symptoms (tinnitus, nausea, rapid breathing, confusion) usually appear within **3\u20138 hours**. Since you\u2019re 24+ hours post-dose with no new symptoms, acute toxicity is unlikely.3. **Pre-existing Conditions:**- **Epilepsy & Carbamazepine:** While carbamazepine can cause drowsiness/confusion, no major interaction is expected with a single Pepto dose. Theoretical protein-binding interactions are unlikely to be significant here.---### **Recommendations:**- **Monitor:** Watch for new/worsening symptoms (e.g., vomiting, rapid breathing, severe tinnitus, or unusual fatigue).- **Hydrate:** Drink water to stay hydrated and help eliminate the medication.- **Medical Consultation:**- **Seek immediate care** if symptoms develop.- **Routine follow-up:** Mention this incident to your neurologist or primary care provider, especially if you have concerns about interactions with carbamazepine.### **Conclusion:**While your dose was likely sub-toxic, your medical history warrants caution. No urgent action is needed if you remain asymptomatic, but stay vigilant and consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice."

        "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \\\"systematic\\\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",

        "answer": "Your girlfriend's situation is deeply concerning, and it\u2019s clear that a multidisciplinary approach is needed. Here\u2019s a structured plan to explore potential causes and seek effective care:### **1. Specialized Medical Evaluation**- **Autonomic Disorders**: Seek a **dysautonomia specialist** or clinic (e.g., for POTS or autonomic neuropathy). Key tests include:- **Tilt Table Test**: Evaluates blood pressure/heart rate changes upon standing.- **Skin Biopsy**: Checks for small fiber neuropathy.- **24-hour Holter Monitor/ECG/EEG**: To capture heart/brain activity during episodes.- **Autoimmune Panels**: Rule out autoimmune triggers (e.g., ANA, anti-ganglioside antibodies).- **University Hospitals**: Consider tertiary centers like Charit\u00e9 (Berlin) or other German university hospitals with neurology/autonomic departments.### **2. Post-Vaccine Syndromes & Long COVID Clinics**- Some clinics specialize in post-vaccine adverse events or long COVID, which may share mechanisms (e.g., dysautonomia). Research centers in Germany or abroad (e.g., Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic collaborations).### **3. Nutritional Support**- **Dietitian Consultation**: Focus on calorie-dense, small, frequent meals (e.g., liquid supplements, protein shakes). Address potential deficiencies (iron, B12, electrolytes).- **Hydration**: Increased salt/fluid intake (if no contraindications) to stabilize blood volume.### **4. Symptom Management**- **Physical Counterpressure Maneuvers**: Leg crossing, muscle tensing to prevent fainting.- **Compression Garments**: May improve blood flow if POTS-related.- **Safe Mobility**: Use a wheelchair or cane outdoors to prevent falls.### **5. Psychological & Emotional Support**- **Therapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or counseling to cope with chronic illness stress.- **Support Groups**: Connect with others experiencing post-vaccine syndromes or dysautonomia (e.g., Dysautonomia International).### **6. Advocacy & Documentation**- **Symptom Diary**: Track triggers, duration, and patterns (e.g., food, activity, posture).- **Adverse Event Reporting**: Report to Germany\u2019s Paul-Ehrlich-Institut to contribute to vaccine safety data.### **7. Medication Caution & Trials**- Work with a pharmacologist or specialist to trial low-dose medications (e.g., beta-blockers, fludrocortisone) under close monitoring. Avoid triggers like carbohydrate powders if linked to episodes.### **8. Explore Emerging Research**- Investigate clinical trials or research on post-vaccine dysautonomia. Some institutions may offer experimental treatments (e.g., IVIG, immunomodulators).### **9. Immediate Safety Measures**- **Emergency Plan**: Ensure she\u2019s never alone during high-risk activities (e.g., bathing, walking). Teach bystanders how to position her safely during episodes (recovery position).### **10. Legal/Social Support**- Contact patient advocacy organizations (e.g., STIKO in Germany) for guidance on accessing disability resources or specialized care.### **Key Considerations**- **Rule Out Rare Causes**: Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), CSF leaks, or mitochondrial disorders.- **Avoid Dismissive Care**: Persistently seek doctors who take her symptoms seriously. Consider traveling to specialists if necessary.This journey requires patience and resilience. While the vaccine may have been a trigger, the focus now is on identifying the underlying mechanism and accessing targeted care. Keep advocating fiercely for her health\u2014she deserves a life free from this suffering."

        "question": "I\u2019m a 23 year old female. I have recently been getting very dizzy, my body gets hot and seeing stars until my vision disappears completely and I can\u2019t see at all and it doesn\u2019t go away until I lay down or sit. I have never had a problem like this ever but it\u2019s starting to interfere with my life because I\u2019m always having to sit. I\u2019m 5\u201d3 and I weigh around a 100 pounds. My weight does fluctuate a lot (+ or - 5 pounds every week) I try to eat healthy but I also sometimes can\u2019t get myself to eat because I feel anxiety and my heart starts beating weird. I also have epilepsy and I am on Keppra and have been on it for almost 3 years so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem but I try to take it on time, I take 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don\u2019t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time. I add a lot of salt on my food, I eat a lot of olives and a lot of pickles, sometimes I will individually season spoonfuls or food before putting them in my mouth because it\u2019s what tastes good to me (if that is of any significance)And I do drink alcohol about 3 times a week",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the information provided, your symptoms (dizziness, vision changes, heat sensations) when standing, which resolve upon sitting/lying down, are concerning and warrant prompt medical evaluation. Here\u2019s a structured breakdown of potential causes and recommendations:### **Possible Causes to Consider**1. **Orthostatic Hypotension or POTS**- A sudden drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) could explain your symptoms. These are common in young women and exacerbated by dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or low blood volume. Your high salt intake might be an unconscious attempt to compensate for low blood pressure, but without adequate hydration, it may not help.2. **Dehydration or Electrolyte Imbalance**- Alcohol (a diuretic) and high salt intake without sufficient water could lead to dehydration. Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., sodium, potassium) might also contribute to dizziness and palpitations.3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**- Fluctuating weight, irregular eating, and anxiety around food could lead to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or deficiencies (e.g., iron-deficiency anemia), both of which can cause dizziness and fatigue.4. **Anxiety/Stress-Related Symptoms**- Anxiety can trigger hyperventilation (leading to lightheadedness) and palpitations. However, physical causes must be ruled out first.5. **Medication or Alcohol Interactions**- Keppra can cause dizziness as a side effect, though this is less likely after 3 years of stable use. However, alcohol may worsen Keppra\u2019s side effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness) and dehydrate you further.### **Urgent Recommendations**1. **Seek Medical Evaluation ASAP**- **Primary Care Doctor or Neurologist**: Request orthostatic vital signs (blood pressure/heart rate lying vs. standing), blood tests (CBC, electrolytes, glucose, thyroid), and possibly a tilt-table test for POTS.- **Cardiology Check**: To rule out arrhythmias or structural heart issues, especially with palpitations.2. **Hydration and Diet Adjustments**- Increase **water intake** (especially if consuming alcohol/salt). Aim for electrolyte-rich fluids (e.g., oral rehydration solutions).- Eat small, frequent meals with balanced carbs/protein to stabilize blood sugar. Consider snacks like nuts, yogurt, or fruit.3. **Reduce Alcohol Intake**- Alcohol worsens dehydration and interacts with Keppra. Temporarily abstain to see if symptoms improve.4. **Manage Anxiety**- Discuss anxiety-related eating difficulties with a doctor or therapist. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or short-term anti-anxiety strategies may help.5. **Monitor Symptoms**- Track episodes (timing, triggers, food/alcohol intake) to identify patterns. Check if symptoms correlate with missed meals, alcohol use, or stress.### **When to Seek Immediate Care**Go to the ER if you experience:- Fainting (syncope), chest pain, severe headache, or prolonged palpitations.- Symptoms that persist even after sitting/lying down.### **Final Note**Your symptoms are significant and disruptive, so don\u2019t delay evaluation. While some causes may be manageable (e.g., POTS, dehydration), others require urgent attention. Prioritize hydration, consistent nutrition, and reducing alcohol while arranging a doctor\u2019s visit."

I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Managing refractory epilepsy requires a comprehensive approach, especially when considering surgical options. Here\u2019s a structured overview of potential alternatives and adjunct therapies to discuss with your specialist:### **Medical & Pharmacological Options**1. **Newer AEDs**:- **Cenobamate**, **Brivaracetam**, or **Perampanel** may be options if not yet tried. These have shown efficacy in refractory cases.- **Epidiolex (CBD)**: FDA-approved for certain epilepsies. Even if using cannabis, standardized CBD under medical guidance might help.2. **Combination Therapy**:- Review current AEDs with your neurologist. Adjusting ratios or adding a third drug with a different mechanism (e.g., **clobazam**) could be explored.3. **Drug Interaction Check**:- Cannabis can interact with liver enzymes affecting AED metabolism. Discuss use with your doctor to ensure optimal dosing.---### **Dietary Approaches**- **Modified Atkins or Low Glycemic Index Diets**: Less restrictive than keto but may still reduce seizures.- **Supplements**: Magnesium, omega-3s, or vitamin D (evidence is mixed; consult your doctor for safety).---### **Device-Based Therapies**1. **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)**:- For focal seizures; requires localization via EMU evaluation.2. **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**:- Approved for epilepsy, though less common than VNS/RNS.---### **Alternative Therapies (Caution Advised)**- **Acupuncture**: Mixed evidence; some studies suggest modest reduction in seizures.- **Medical Cannabis Optimization**: Ensure THC:CBD ratio is tailored for seizure control (e.g., high CBD strains).- **Biofeedback/Neurofeedback**: Teaches self-regulation of brain activity; limited but promising data.---### **Lifestyle & Adjunct Strategies**- **Stress Management**: Mindfulness, yoga, or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce triggers.- **Sleep Hygiene**: Prioritize consistent sleep schedules.- **Trigger Tracking**: Use a seizure diary to identify overlooked triggers (e.g., missed doses, stress patterns).---### **Experimental Options**- **Clinical Trials**: Explore trials for novel drugs, devices, or gene therapies via platforms like ClinicalTrials.gov.---### **Surgical Considerations**- **EMU Evaluation**: Critical for mapping seizure foci. Outcomes may determine candidacy for laser ablation, resection, or RNS.- **VNS vs. RNS**: Discuss pros/cons with your team. RNS is newer and\u66f4\u9002\u5408focal seizures.---### **Cautions**- **Avoid Unproven Claims**: Chiropractic adjustments lack evidence for epilepsy; prioritize therapies with scientific backing.- **Collaborate Closely**: Any new intervention should be vetted by your epilepsy specialist to avoid risks/interactions.Your proactive approach is commendable. While surgery may eventually be necessary, these options could bridge the gap or complement long-term management. Always consult your care team before making changes. Best wishes for your EMU evaluation and ongoing journey. \ud83c\udf1f"

I've always had intense headaches post ECT and during the first session I had intense deja vu experiences 2-10 times per day, this after about 1,5 months lowered to 3 times per week but up to 10 times a day. With this I developed difficulties placing people I've recently met, when I had gotten to know a face something in me just told me that I had known them since long. This time around, everyone I meet I recognise. Yesterday I was hours away from my hometown, and somehow I only met people I knew...but no one said hello...Anyone know information about this occurrence and whether it's a neurological concern or just a temporary side effect? My ECT-nurse had never heard of it before.Info: Male, 24 y/o, Caucasian, mucho depressed, no medications only ECT.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you're experiencing\u2014intense headaches, frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and memory distortions (such as misrecognizing strangers as familiar individuals)\u2014are unusual but may be linked to ECT. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and recommended steps:### 1. **Common ECT Side Effects**- **Headaches**: Very common post-ECT, often managed with hydration, rest, or medications like acetaminophen.- **Memory issues**: Temporary retrograde amnesia (forgetting recent events) or difficulty forming new memories is typical, especially with bilateral ECT.### 2. **Neurological Considerations**- **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu**: Often linked to temporal lobe activity. ECT-induced seizures could transiently disrupt this region, leading to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or memory distortions. Persistent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (\u22651 episode/week) is rare but may signal atypical electrical activity, such as focal seizures.- **Recognition Disturbances**: Mistaking strangers for familiar people (a form of paramnesia) might reflect disrupted memory consolidation or temporal lobe dysfunction. The \"hours away from hometown\" example could involve confabulation (filling memory gaps with false beliefs).### 3. **Possible Causes**- **ECT-Related**: Altered neural activity during/after seizures might temporarily affect memory and perception.- **Seizure Activity**: Rarely, ECT could unmask a predisposition to focal seizures, which may manifest as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or memory distortions.- **Psychological Factors**: Severe depression itself can cause dissociative symptoms or cognitive distortions, though the timing (post-ECT) suggests a physical trigger.### 4. **Urgent Steps to Take**- **Neurology Consult**: Request a referral to a neurologist for evaluation. Tests like an EEG (to check for seizure activity) and MRI (to rule out structural issues) are critical.- **ECT Protocol Review**: Discuss adjusting ECT parameters (e.g., electrode placement, frequency, or pulse width) with your psychiatrist. Unilateral (vs. bilateral) placement may reduce cognitive effects.- **Document Symptoms**: Track the frequency/duration of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, headaches, and recognition errors to identify patterns.### 5. **Temporary vs. Persistent Effects**- Most cognitive side effects improve weeks to months after ECT ends, but persistent symptoms warrant closer investigation. Your d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and recognition issues may resolve over time but should not be dismissed without evaluation.### Final NoteWhile these symptoms are unsettling, they\u2019re likely manageable with prompt medical attention. Advocate for a neurology consult and collaborate closely with your ECT team to balance treatment benefits and risks. You\u2019re not alone\u2014uncommon reactions do occur, and thorough evaluation is key to ensuring safety."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms described could be indicative of several conditions, and a thorough evaluation is necessary to distinguish between them. Here's a structured analysis:### **Key Considerations:**1. **Epilepsy (Focal Seizures):**- **Supporting Factors:** Involuntary grimacing (possible automatisms), slurred speech (dysphasia), and post-episode fatigue (postictal state) are consistent with focal seizures.- **Contradictions:** Normal MRI/EEG (if interictal) doesn\u2019t rule out epilepsy, but the absence of EEG abnormalities during an episode weakens the diagnosis. Initial fainting episodes may have been misattributed to epilepsy if syncope was mistaken for seizures.2. **Migraine with Complex Aura:**- **Supporting Factors:** History of migraines, nausea, \"swollen brain\" sensation (cephalic allodynia), speech difficulties (migrainous aura), and postdrome fatigue (\"hit by a truck\"). Auras can evolve over time and may lack typical headache phases.- **Contradictions:** Grimacing is atypical but could overlap with migraine-associated movement disorders (e.g., vestibular migraine with brainstem aura).3. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**- **Supporting Factors:** Episodes without EEG correlates, possible psychological stressors (unmentioned here), and variable symptoms.- **Contradictions:** Post-episode fatigue and physical symptoms (e.g., scalp itch) are less common in PNES.4. **Other Considerations:**- **Syncope:** Unlikely, as she no longer loses consciousness.- **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** Uncommon in a healthy 35-year-old with normal imaging.- **Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disorders:** Less likely given a clear MRI.### **Recommendations for Evaluation:**- **EEG Monitoring:** Prolonged video-EEG to capture an episode is critical. This can differentiate seizures from migraines or PNES.- **Symptom Diary:** Track triggers (e.g., stress, menstrual cycle, diet), duration, and symptom progression.- **Second Opinion:** Seek a neurologist specializing in epilepsy or migraine to reassess the diagnosis.- **Migraine-Specific Workup:** Trial of migraine abortives (e.g., triptans) or preventives (e.g., beta-blockers, anticonvulsants like topiramate, which also treat migraines) may clarify the diagnosis.- **Cardiac Evaluation:** If syncope is reconsidered, tilt-table testing or Holter monitoring could exclude arrhythmias.### **Next Steps:**- **Avoid Antiseizure Medications Without Confirmation:** Given the diagnostic uncertainty and potential side effects, this is reasonable until further testing.- **Explore Migraine Management:** If symptoms improve with migraine therapies, this could support a migraine diagnosis.- **Psychological Assessment:** If PNES is suspected, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or counseling may help.### **Conclusion:**While epilepsy remains a possibility, migraines with complex aura are equally plausible. Further testing (EEG during an episode) and a tailored diagnostic approach are essential. Advocate for a comprehensive workup to ensure an accurate diagnosis before committing to long-term treatment."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you experienced are concerning and likely related to your substance use, particularly cocaine. Here\u2019s a breakdown of potential causes and next steps:### Key Considerations:1. **Cocaine-Induced Complications**:- **Stroke/TIA**: Cocaine causes vasoconstriction, increasing the risk of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), even in young individuals. Unilateral numbness, vision/hearing loss, and syncope align with this possibility.- **Seizure**: Cocaine lowers the seizure threshold. Your episode (loss of consciousness, post-event confusion, urination) and your friend\u2019s observation of seizure-like activity suggest a drug-induced seizure.2. **Cardiovascular Effects**:- **Arrhythmia**: Cocaine can trigger irregular heart rhythms, leading to syncope or seizures. While your EKG was normal, intermittent arrhythmias might not be captured without prolonged monitoring.- **Blood Pressure Instability**: Cocaine initially raises blood pressure, but a post-event drop (as noted) could contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope.3. **Other Possibilities**:- **Hemiplegic Migraine**: Rare migraines with unilateral numbness and aura, though less likely given the context of substance use.- **Convulsive Syncope**: Fainting with brief jerking movements, but unilateral symptoms are unusual.### Why Initial Tests Might Be Normal:- **Timing**: Blood tests/EKGs may miss transient issues (e.g., arrhythmias, cocaine metabolites if tested later).- **Toxicology**: Standard bloodwork may not screen for substances or adulterants in cocaine, which could contribute to symptoms.### Critical Next Steps:1. **Neurological Evaluation**:- **MRI/MRA**: To rule out stroke, vasculitis, or structural abnormalities.- **EEG**: To assess for seizure activity or predisposition.2. **Cardiac Workup**:- **Holter Monitor**: To detect intermittent arrhythmias.- **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate heart structure/function.3. **Substance Cessation**:- Cocaine, vaping, and weed all pose risks. Seek support for cessation (e.g., counseling, rehab programs).4. **Follow-Up Care**:- Discuss the episode with a neurologist or cardiologist. Advocate for a toxicology screen if not already done.### Immediate Advice:- **Avoid driving or operating machinery** until cleared by a doctor.- **Hydrate and rest**, but prioritize urgent follow-up testing.- **Be transparent with healthcare providers** about substance use for accurate care.This episode is a serious warning sign. Even if initial tests were normal, underlying issues may exist. Prioritize further evaluation and substance cessation to prevent recurrence."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms described\u2014sudden loss of concentration followed by a whole-body twitch\u2014warrant a thorough medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause. Here\u2019s a structured breakdown of potential considerations and recommended steps:### Possible Causes:1. **Myoclonic Seizures**:- **Characteristics**: Brief, shock-like muscle jerks, often part of epilepsy syndromes (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). These can occur during wakefulness and may be triggered by stress, fatigue, or concentration shifts.- **Relevance**: The whole-body twitch aligns with myoclonic activity. However, timing and triggers (refocusing) may need further exploration.2. **Reflex Epilepsy**:- **Triggers**: Rare cases involve specific cognitive activities (e.g., concentration) inducing seizures. An EEG during episodes could identify atypical brain activity.3. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**:- **Context**: Stress-related episodes mimicking seizures, without abnormal electrical brain activity. Psychological evaluation might be beneficial.4. **Benign Fasciculation Syndrome**:- **Features**: Non-dangerous muscle twitches, often stress-induced. However, these typically affect localized muscles rather than the entire body.5. **Tic Disorders**:- **Consideration**: Simple motor tics (sudden movements), though these often begin earlier in life and may involve premonitory urges.6. **Physiological Factors**:- **Electrolyte Imbalances/Dehydration**: Previous seizure linked to dehydration suggests sensitivity. Ensure adequate hydration and check for deficiencies (magnesium, calcium).- **Stimulants**: Caffeine or medications could exacerbate twitching.### Recommended Steps:1. **Neurological Consultation**:- Seek a neurologist, preferably an epileptologist, for specialized evaluation. Mention the specific trigger (refocusing) and history of dehydration-related seizure.2. **Diagnostic Testing**:- **EEG (Electroencephalogram)**: Captures brain activity during episodes to detect epileptiform patterns.- **MRI**: Rules out structural brain abnormalities.- **Blood Tests**: Check electrolytes, glucose, thyroid function, and metabolic markers.3. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:- **Hydration/Nutrition**: Maintain fluid intake and balanced electrolytes.- **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure adequate rest, as fatigue lowers seizure thresholds.- **Stress Management**: Techniques like mindfulness may reduce anxiety-triggered episodes.4. **Documentation**:- Track episodes (frequency, triggers, duration) to aid diagnosis.### Reassurance:- While the twitching is concerning, many causes (e.g., benign fasciculations, stress-related tics) are manageable. Early evaluation is key to ruling out serious conditions and guiding treatment.**Next Step**: Schedule a neurologist appointment promptly to explore these possibilities. Avoid self-diagnosis and prioritize clinical assessment for clarity and peace of mind."

        "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \\\"episodes\\\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \\\"phases\\\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \\\"in control\\\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \\\"BACKE\\\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \\\"weird\\\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The described episodes in your daughter raise several important considerations that warrant further medical evaluation. Here's a structured summary of the key points and recommendations:### Key Observations & Possible Conditions:1. **Nocturnal Seizures (Frontal Lobe Epilepsy):**- **Rationale:** The structured phases (violent rocking, vocalizations, tongue clicking), post-episode twitching (postictal state), and visual hallucinations (aura-like) suggest possible frontal lobe epilepsy. Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) can mimic parasomnias but involves stereotyped, hyperkinetic movements and autonomic arousal.- **Clues:** Retention of partial awareness, memory recall, and urgent, specific post-episode requests align with focal aware seizures. The forehead sensation and visual distortions could represent auras.2. **Atypical Parasomnias:**- **Disorders of Arousal:** Typically occur in NREM sleep (early night) but usually lack detailed recall. However, \"atypical\" variants with complex behaviors and partial awareness exist.- **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD):** Unlikely, as episodes occur too early in the sleep cycle (NREM-dominated phase).3. **Psychological Factors:**- Anxiety or stress from travel/UTI could exacerbate parasomnias, but the structured, non-narrative nature of episodes and hallucinations are less typical.### Next Steps for Evaluation:1. **Consult a Pediatric Neurologist:**- Priority referral to rule out epilepsy. Mention the UTI/antibiotic history, though likely coincidental.2. **Diagnostic Testing:**- **EEG with Sleep Deprivation:** Captures brain activity during sleep and may identify epileptiform discharges.- **Video EEG Monitoring:** If episodes are frequent, inpatient monitoring can correlate behaviors with EEG findings.- **MRI Brain:** If seizures are suspected, to exclude structural abnormalities.3. **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):**- Assesses sleep architecture, rules out apnea, and documents episodes in a controlled setting.4. **Behavioral & Symptom Tracking:**- Keep a detailed sleep diary (timing, triggers, episode descriptions).- Record episodes on video to show clinicians.### Additional Considerations:- **UTI/Antibiotics:** While cefixime is rarely linked to neurotoxicity, infections can lower seizure thresholds. Report this history but focus on current symptoms.- **ADHD/Anxiety:** Continue multidisciplinary therapy, but these episodes likely require separate neurological investigation.### Immediate Recommendations:- **Safety Measures:** Secure her sleep environment (e.g., padded bed rails, remove sharp objects) to prevent injury during episodes.- **Avoid Triggers:** Ensure consistent sleep hygiene (routine, calming pre-sleep activities) to minimize stress-related exacerbations.### Conclusion:These episodes are concerning for a neurological origin, particularly nocturnal seizures. Prompt evaluation by a pediatric neurologist is critical to guide diagnosis and management. Early intervention can address potential epilepsy or other conditions, ensuring both safety and appropriate treatment."

I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "**Immediate Actions and Safety:**1. **Suicidal Thoughts:** If you're experiencing suicidal thoughts, seek urgent help immediately. In the UK, contact emergency services (999), go to A&E, or reach out to a crisis team via NHS 111.2. **Do Not Stop Citalopram Abruptly:** Sudden discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dizziness, nausea, mood swings). Tapering should be guided by a healthcare professional.**Medication Considerations:**- **Citalopram and Worsening Depression:** While SSRIs can rarely worsen depression, after 4\u20136 months, it\u2019s more likely ineffective rather than causative. A switch or adjunct therapy may be needed.- **Avoid TCAs (e.g., Amitriptyline):** These lower the seizure threshold and may interact with topiramate (sedation, anticholinergic effects). Not recommended given your epilepsy history.- **SNRIs (Venlafaxine/Duloxetine):** Potential alternatives with dual action (serotonin/norepinephrine). Monitor for activation vs. fatigue. Check for CYP450 interactions with topiramate (minimal risk, but confirm with a pharmacist).- **Atypical Antidepressants:**- **Vortioxetine:** Lower sedation risk, minimal drug interactions.- **Agomelatine:** Sleep-friendly, but requires liver monitoring.- **Avoid Bupropion:** Lowers seizure threshold.**Topiramate and Epilepsy:**- Ensure any new antidepressant doesn\u2019t exacerbate myoclonus or interact with epilepsy meds. Discuss AED options (e.g., levetiracetam) with your neurologist if jerks persist.**Fatigue Management:**- SNRIs and vortioxetine are less sedating than mirtazapine. Avoid TCAs and trazodone.**Next Steps:**- **Urgent GP Access:** If appointments are unavailable, request an emergency callback or visit a walk-in centre.- **Pharmacy Advice:** A pharmacist can guide safe tapering and urgent referrals.- **Mental Health Support:** Engage with IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) for CBT or counseling while awaiting medication changes.**Summary:**- Prioritize safety\u2014seek immediate help if suicidal.- Transition to an SNRI or atypical antidepressant under medical supervision.- Avoid TCAs and bupropion. Monitor for drug interactions and seizure risks.- Persist in seeking medical review via GP, crisis teams, or emergency services."

        "question": "Age 5 Sex male Height 40\u201d Weight40lb Racewhite Duration of complaint 20 months Location Colorado, USA Any existing relevant medical issues CP, epilepsy Current medications Generic keppra 2.5mg/ml 2x daily My 5 yo son with CP and epilepsy My kid is amazing and funny and smart. We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "First, let me say that your love and dedication to your son are truly inspiring. It\u2019s clear that you are doing everything in your power to ensure his safety and well-being, and that is a testament to your strength as a parent. It\u2019s also completely understandable that you feel this level of fear and anxiety after witnessing such a significant event like a generalized seizure. Many parents in your situation would feel the same way.Key Points to Consider:Likelihood of Breakthrough Seizures:Your son\u2019s seizure history is linked to his perinatal stroke, which caused a structural brain injury. This type of epilepsy (symptomatic focal epilepsy) can often be well-controlled with medication, especially if he has been seizure-free on Keppra for a significant period.The fact that he is currently doing well on Keppra is a very positive sign. However, breakthrough seizures can occur, particularly if there are triggers like illness, fever, sleep deprivation, or stress. The risk is not zero, but it sounds like his seizures are currently well-managed.Long-Term Control with Keppra:Keppra is a commonly used and effective medication for controlling seizures, especially in children. Many children with epilepsy due to a brain injury like a stroke can remain seizure-free for years or even indefinitely on medication.However, epilepsy can be unpredictable. Some children may outgrow their seizures, while others may need adjustments to their medication over time. Regular follow-ups with his pediatric neurologist are essential to monitor his progress and make any necessary changes.Your Anxiety and Its Impact:Your fear is valid, but it\u2019s important to recognize that your anxiety is affecting your quality of life and potentially your son\u2019s as well. Children are incredibly perceptive, and he may sense your worry, which could inadvertently create stress for him.It\u2019s crucial to find a balance between vigilance and allowing him to live a full, happy life. Overprotectiveness, while coming from a place of love, can limit his opportunities for growth, independence, and joy.Strategies to Manage Your Fear:Education: The more you understand about his condition, the more empowered you\u2019ll feel. Ask his neurologist about the specific risks, triggers, and long-term outlook for his type of epilepsy.Therapy: Consider speaking with a therapist who specializes in trauma or parenting children with medical complexities. They can help you process your fears and develop coping strategies.Support Groups: Connecting with other parents of children with epilepsy or cerebral palsy can provide emotional support and practical advice.Self-Care: Prioritize your own mental and physical health. If you\u2019re not well, it\u2019s harder to care for your son effectively.Allowing Him to Be a Kid:While it\u2019s natural to want to protect him, it\u2019s also important to let him explore, play, and take age-appropriate risks. This is how children learn and develop resilience.Gradually reintroduce activities like hiking or in-person therapies, especially if they bring him joy and developmental benefits. You can take precautions (e.g., carrying rescue meds, going to less crowded trails) without completely avoiding these experiences.Encourage his independence in small ways, like giving him privacy when appropriate or letting him make choices about his daily activities.COVID and Fever Concerns:While it\u2019s true that fever can lower the seizure threshold, it\u2019s important to weigh the risks and benefits of isolation. Prolonged social isolation can impact his social and emotional development.Discuss with his neurologist whether fever precautions (e.g., using antipyretics like acetaminophen at the first sign of fever) could help mitigate seizure risks while allowing him to engage in more activities.Final Thoughts:Your son sounds like an amazing, resilient child, and you are doing an incredible job advocating for him. It\u2019s okay to feel scared, but try to focus on the positives: he\u2019s thriving on his current medication, he\u2019s surrounded by love, and he has a bright future ahead. With time, support, and perhaps some professional guidance, you can find a balance that allows both you and your son to live more freely and joyfully.If you haven\u2019t already, consider discussing your concerns with his pediatric neurologist. They can provide more personalized insights and reassurance based on his specific medical history. You\u2019re not alone in this journey, and there are resources and people who can help you navigate it."

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you've been facing, and I want to commend you for your persistence in seeking answers and trying to improve your situation. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that this has been incredibly frustrating and overwhelming.While I\u2019m not a doctor, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help guide your conversation with your physician. Your symptoms\u2014particularly the sensation of blanking out, difficulty focusing, and the temporary relief you experience when manipulating your TMJ joint\u2014suggest that there could be a neurological, vascular, or musculoskeletal component to your condition. Here are some possibilities to consider and discuss with your doctor:1. Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) DysfunctionThe TMJ is located near several important structures, including nerves, blood vessels, and muscles. Dysfunction in this area can sometimes cause referred symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, and cognitive disturbances.The relief you experience when manipulating the joint suggests that TMJ dysfunction could be playing a role. A dentist or oral surgeon specializing in TMJ disorders might be able to provide further evaluation and treatment options, such as a custom mouthguard or physical therapy.2. Vascular Compression or AbnormalitiesYour theory about a subdued artery near the TMJ joint is worth exploring. The internal carotid artery and other vessels run close to this area, and compression or abnormalities in blood flow could potentially cause symptoms like the ones you\u2019re describing.Since you\u2019ve already had an MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), which looks at blood vessels, and it came back normal, it might be worth asking if a more specialized vascular study (e.g., a CT angiogram or Doppler ultrasound) could provide additional insights.3. Cervicogenic IssuesThe connection between your neck, jaw, and symptoms is intriguing. Issues with the cervical spine or surrounding muscles can sometimes cause neurological symptoms, including brain fog, dizziness, and visual disturbances.A physical therapist or specialist in cervical spine disorders might be able to assess whether there\u2019s a musculoskeletal component contributing to your symptoms.4. Neurological ConditionsYour symptoms could potentially be related to a neurological condition, such as:Migraine variants: Some types of migraines can cause cognitive disturbances without the classic headache pain.Seizure activity: Absence seizures or other subtle seizure types can cause brief lapses in awareness or focus.Dysautonomia: Conditions like POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) can cause blood flow issues and cognitive symptoms.A neurologist might recommend further testing, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to rule out seizure activity or autonomic testing to evaluate for dysautonomia.5. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Long COVIDIf your symptoms have been exacerbated or triggered by an illness (even a mild one), it\u2019s worth considering conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) or long COVID. These conditions can cause cognitive dysfunction, often described as brain fog, and may be linked to autonomic nervous system dysfunction.6. Psychological FactorsWhile your symptoms are clearly physical, the stress and frustration of dealing with a chronic condition can exacerbate symptoms or make them feel more intense. It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve already seen a therapist, and continuing to address the emotional toll of your condition is important.What to Bring Up with Your Doctor:Detailed symptom diary: Document your symptoms, triggers, and the relief you experience with TMJ manipulation. Include timing, duration, and any patterns you notice.TMJ and vascular concerns: Mention the relief you get from manipulating the TMJ joint and your theory about blood flow.Request further testing: Ask if additional imaging (e.g., CT angiogram, Doppler ultrasound) or neurological tests (e.g., EEG, autonomic testing) could be helpful.Referrals: Request referrals to specialists, such as a neurologist, TMJ specialist, or vascular surgeon, depending on the direction your doctor thinks is most promising.Final Thoughts:Your persistence and self-advocacy are incredibly important. It\u2019s clear that your symptoms are real and significantly impacting your life, and it\u2019s worth continuing to push for answers. If your current doctor isn\u2019t able to provide the support you need, consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist or a multidisciplinary clinic that deals with complex or hard-to-diagnose conditions.In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. Living with an undiagnosed condition is incredibly challenging, but you\u2019re doing everything you can to find answers. Keep advocating for yourself, and don\u2019t hesitate to lean on supportive friends, family, or mental health professionals as you navigate this journey.Wishing you the best of luck with your upcoming appointment and hoping you find the answers and relief you deserve."

        "question": "Female, 40, has a history of seizures but not since 2011, after surgery,  Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great that you're seeking to understand more about seizures, especially given the history you mentioned. Let\u2019s break down your questions one by one:1. Can you feel a seizure in your head?Yes, some people can feel sensations in their head before or during a seizure. These sensations are often referred to as auras or prodromal symptoms. Auras are actually focal seizures that affect a specific part of the brain and can cause unusual feelings, such as tingling, dizziness, or a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. For some, these sensations may feel like they originate in the head before spreading to other parts of the body.2. Why don\u2019t all seizures show up on an EEG?An EEG (electroencephalogram) measures electrical activity in the brain, but it has limitations:Depth of the seizure focus: If the seizure originates deep in the brain (e.g., in the mesial temporal lobe), the electrical activity might not reach the scalp electrodes.Duration of the EEG: Seizures can be infrequent, and a standard EEG might not capture one if it doesn\u2019t occur during the test.Type of seizure: Some seizures, like focal seizures without impaired awareness, may produce subtle electrical changes that are harder to detect.Technical limitations: The EEG records activity from the surface of the brain, so small or localized seizures might not be picked up.3. Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one?Yes, this can happen. Some seizures, particularly focal seizures without impaired awareness, may not cause obvious symptoms. Afterward, a person might feel confused, fatigued, or have a sense that something unusual happened. In some cases, people only realize they\u2019ve had a seizure based on indirect clues, like finding themselves in a different location or noticing injuries they can\u2019t explain.4. Could someone feel a seizure happening inside their head?Yes, as mentioned earlier, auras or focal seizures can create sensations that feel like they\u2019re happening inside the head. These might include:A rising sensation in the stomach or chest.Strange smells, tastes, or sounds.A sense of fear or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Pressure, tingling, or a \u201cwave-like\u201d feeling in the head.5. Is there an article that explains all this?While I can\u2019t provide direct links, I recommend looking for reputable sources like:The Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com): They have comprehensive information on seizures, auras, and EEGs.Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic: These sites offer detailed explanations of seizure types, symptoms, and diagnostic tools.Peer-reviewed articles on PubMed (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for more scientific insights.Additional Notes:Since your last seizure was in 2011, it\u2019s important to continue regular follow-ups with a neurologist, especially if you experience new symptoms or concerns.If you\u2019re ever unsure about whether you\u2019ve had a seizure, keeping a detailed journal of symptoms and discussing them with your doctor can be very helpful.Let me know if you\u2019d like help finding specific resources or further clarification!"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about your health and seeking advice regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Given your complex medical history, it\u2019s understandable that you have concerns. Here are some key points to consider and discuss with your healthcare providers:1. Medical History and RisksGuillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS): Since you had GBS in the past, it\u2019s important to discuss this with your neurologist and rheumatologist. While GBS is a rare side effect of some vaccines, the risk is generally very low. The COVID-19 vaccines (especially mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna) have not been strongly linked to GBS, but your doctors can provide personalized guidance.Autoimmune Conditions: Your history of autoimmune diseases (Hidradenitis Suppurativa and undiagnosed autoimmune issues) and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) mean your immune system is already dysregulated. Vaccines are generally safe for people with autoimmune conditions, but your rheumatologist can help weigh the risks and benefits.Seizure History: Since you\u2019ve been seizure-free on Keppra, the vaccine is unlikely to affect your seizure control. However, stress or fever from the vaccine could theoretically lower the seizure threshold, so it\u2019s good to monitor for any changes.2. Previous Reaction to the Flu ShotYour neurological reaction to the flu shot after GBS is a valid concern. Discuss this in detail with your neurologist and rheumatologist. They may recommend a specific type of COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna) or advise on precautions to take before and after vaccination.3. COVID-19 Risks vs. Vaccine RisksCOVID-19 Risks: As someone with autoimmune conditions and a history of neurological issues, you may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 complications. The virus itself can trigger autoimmune flares, neurological issues, and other serious health problems.Vaccine Risks: The COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective for the vast majority of people, including those with autoimmune conditions. Side effects are generally mild (e.g., sore arm, fatigue, fever) and short-lived.4. Consult Your SpecialistsNeurologist: Since your neurologist is recommending the vaccine, they likely believe the benefits outweigh the risks. Ask them about any specific concerns related to your seizure history and GBS.Rheumatologist: Your rheumatologist can provide insight into how the vaccine might interact with your autoimmune conditions and whether any additional precautions (e.g., timing with medications) are needed.5. Vaccine OptionsmRNA Vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna): These are generally preferred for people with autoimmune conditions due to their strong efficacy and safety profile.Johnson & Johnson (J&J): This is a viral vector vaccine and has been associated with a very rare risk of blood clots and GBS. Your doctors may advise against this option given your history.Novavax: This is a protein-based vaccine and may be an option if you\u2019re concerned about mRNA vaccines, though availability may vary.6. Precautions and MonitoringIf you decide to get vaccinated, let the vaccinator know about your medical history.Stay hydrated, rest, and monitor for any side effects (e.g., fever, fatigue). If you experience anything unusual, contact your doctors immediately.Consider having someone with you after the vaccine in case you feel unwell.7. Final ThoughtsThe decision to get vaccinated should be based on a careful evaluation of your individual risks and benefits. Your doctors are the best resources for personalized advice.If you\u2019re still unsure after consulting your specialists, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist or rheumatologist.It\u2019s clear you\u2019re taking a thoughtful approach to this decision, and your healthcare team is there to support you. Good luck with your discussion with your rheumatologist, and I hope you find clarity on the best path forward!"

        "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \\\"bad anxiety\\\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \\\"not that bad\\\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \\\"panic attacks\\\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \\\"not serious enough\\\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \\\"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\\\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

        "answer": "I\u2019m so sorry you and your boyfriend are going through this. What you\u2019re describing is deeply concerning, and your instincts as a mental health researcher are valid. While panic attacks can present with a wide range of symptoms, the combination of neurological symptoms (e.g., loss of balance, slurred speech, rapid eye movements, fainting, memory loss, and prolonged episodes) raises red flags that this may not be purely psychiatric. The fact that these episodes last 3-6 hours and occur so frequently is also highly unusual for typical panic attacks. Here are some thoughts and suggestions:1. Neurological Evaluation is CrucialThe symptoms you\u2019re describing (e.g., slurred speech, loss of balance, fainting, rapid eye movements, memory loss) could indicate a neurological condition. Some possibilities to consider include:Epilepsy or non-convulsive seizures: Some seizure types (e.g., complex partial seizures or absence seizures) can mimic panic attacks and cause memory loss, confusion, and autonomic symptoms like vomiting. An EEG might not always catch these if it wasn\u2019t done during an episode.Vestibular disorders: Issues with the inner ear or balance system could explain the loss of balance and slurred speech.Migraine-associated vertigo or vestibular migraines: These can cause neurological symptoms without the typical headache.Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) or dysautonomia: These conditions can cause fainting, rapid heart rate, and anxiety-like symptoms.Structural brain abnormalities: While the MRI was clear, some conditions (e.g., small tumors, vascular issues) might not always show up on a standard scan.Metabolic or autoimmune conditions: Conditions like hypoglycemia, thyroid dysfunction, or autoimmune encephalitis can cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms.A neurologist would be best equipped to investigate these possibilities. The fact that the ER dismissed him after a normal MRI and EEG is frustrating but not uncommon. Neurological conditions can be tricky to diagnose, and further testing (e.g., a prolonged EEG, tilt table test, or lumbar puncture) might be needed.2. Advocate for a Neurologist ReferralSince your current doctor isn\u2019t taking this seriously, you may need to escalate the situation. Here\u2019s how:Document everything: Keep a detailed log of his symptoms, including dates, times, duration, and triggers. Note any patterns (e.g., relation to stress, food, alcohol, or posture changes).Push for a second opinion: If his psychiatrist refuses to refer him to a neurologist, try going back to the ER during an active episode. The ER might be more likely to take him seriously if they see him in the midst of an attack.Contact a patient advocacy organization: In Canada, organizations like the Canadian Patient Safety Institute or Health Quality Ontario might be able to help you navigate the system or escalate your concerns.Consider private healthcare: If you can afford it, seeing a neurologist privately (even across the border in the U.S.) might be worth exploring.3. Rule Out Medication Side EffectsLyrica (pregabalin) can cause dizziness, confusion, and balance issues, especially at higher doses. The fact that his symptoms worsened after starting Lyrica is worth noting. Seroquel (quetiapine) can also cause orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing), which might explain some of the fainting episodes.Discuss these side effects with his doctor or pharmacist. If the doctor is unwilling to adjust his medications, consider seeking a second opinion from another psychiatrist or primary care provider.4. Consider Other Medical CausesGiven his history of alcohol use and recent stress, it\u2019s worth ruling out other medical conditions:Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: This is a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency often seen in people with alcohol use disorder. Symptoms include confusion, balance issues, and eye movement abnormalities.Electrolyte imbalances: Prolonged vomiting can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can cause neurological symptoms.Hypoglycemia: Low blood sugar can cause confusion, slurred speech, and fainting.A thorough blood workup (including thiamine, electrolytes, glucose, thyroid function, and liver function) might be helpful.5. Mental Health SupportWhile this may not be purely psychiatric, the stress of living with undiagnosed symptoms is undoubtedly taking a toll on his mental health. His suicidal thoughts and feelings of being a burden are serious and need to be addressed.Crisis support: If he\u2019s feeling suicidal, please reach out to a crisis line (e.g., 1-833-456-4566 in Canada) or take him to the ER.Therapy: Even if his psychiatrist won\u2019t refer him, look into community mental health programs or online therapy options (e.g., BetterHelp, Talkspace).6. Next StepsGo back to the ER during an episode: If he has another severe episode, take him to the ER and insist on a neurological evaluation. Seeing him in the midst of an attack might prompt them to take his symptoms more seriously.Seek a new doctor: Continue pushing for a doctor change. In the meantime, try reaching out to walk-in clinics or telemedicine services to see if another doctor will refer him to a neurologist.Consider a medical advocate: If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, consider hiring a patient advocate or asking a trusted friend or family member to help you navigate the system.Final ThoughtsYour boyfriend is lucky to have you advocating for him. Trust your instincts\u2014this doesn\u2019t sound like typical panic attacks, and further investigation is warranted. Keep pushing for answers, and don\u2019t hesitate to escalate your concerns if his current medical team isn\u2019t taking this seriously. Wishing you both strength and clarity as you navigate this difficult situation."

        "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand the situation better. It\u2019s always important to discuss your concerns with your son\u2019s healthcare team, as they have access to his full medical history and can provide personalized advice.Chiari Malformation and EpilepsyChiari malformation is a structural defect in the base of the skull and cerebellum, which can sometimes lead to neurological symptoms. In your son\u2019s case, the cerebellar tonsils are significantly lower than normal (15 mm vs. the typical 3-5 mm), which is considered a significant Chiari malformation (likely Type I). This condition can sometimes cause symptoms like headaches, balance issues, or even seizures, but it is not typically associated with generalized epilepsy.Are They Related?The doctors may have concluded that the Chiari malformation and epilepsy are unrelated because:Generalized epilepsy typically arises from abnormal electrical activity across the entire brain, rather than from a structural issue like Chiari malformation.Chiari malformation-related seizures (if they occur) are usually focal and tied to brainstem or cerebellar compression, not generalized seizures.Your son\u2019s epilepsy was diagnosed as generalized, which suggests a different underlying cause, possibly genetic or related to brain development.That said, it\u2019s understandable why you might see this as a coincidence worth exploring further. Chiari malformation can sometimes cause symptoms that mimic or overlap with epilepsy, such as muscle stiffness, spasms, or even seizures due to brainstem compression. However, if your son\u2019s MRI and EEG findings support generalized epilepsy as a separate diagnosis, the doctors may be confident in their assessment.Next StepsAsk for clarification: Request a detailed explanation from your son\u2019s neurologist about why they believe the two conditions are unrelated. Ask if there\u2019s any possibility of overlap or if further tests (e.g., a follow-up MRI or EEG) could provide more insight.Monitor symptoms: Keep a detailed log of your son\u2019s seizures, including their frequency, duration, and any potential triggers. This can help the doctors determine if there\u2019s any pattern that might suggest a connection to the Chiari malformation.Consider a second opinion: If you\u2019re still unsure, seeking a second opinion from a pediatric neurologist or a specialist in Chiari malformation might provide additional clarity.Surgical evaluation: In some cases, significant Chiari malformation may require surgical intervention (e.g., decompression surgery) if it\u2019s causing symptoms. Ask if this is something that should be considered for your son, even if it\u2019s not directly related to the epilepsy.Final ThoughtsWhile it\u2019s possible for Chiari malformation and epilepsy to coexist independently, your concern is valid, and it\u2019s worth exploring whether there\u2019s any connection in your son\u2019s case. Keep advocating for your child, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions until you feel confident in the care plan."

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",

        "answer": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear about the ongoing challenges you\u2019ve been facing with these episodes of double vision and the associated symptoms. It sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot of testing and consultations, and it\u2019s frustrating not to have a clear answer yet. While I\u2019m not a medical professional, I can offer some thoughts and suggestions based on what you\u2019ve shared. It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve been so diligent in tracking your symptoms and ruling out many potential causes\u2014this kind of detailed record-keeping can be incredibly helpful for doctors.Possible Considerations:Binocular Vision Dysfunction (BVD):BVD occurs when the eyes struggle to work together properly, leading to symptoms like double vision, dizziness, and disorientation. It can sometimes be triggered by stress, fatigue, or even minor misalignments in the eyes. A neuro-optometrist or specialist in binocular vision might be able to assess this further.Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) or Vascular Issues:While TIAs are often associated with older adults, they can occur in younger people and cause temporary neurological symptoms like double vision. Given your history of concussions and the benzo overdose, it might be worth exploring whether there\u2019s any vascular or blood flow issue affecting your brain. A neurologist could consider imaging studies like an MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) to rule this out.Post-Concussion Syndrome or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):Even minor concussions can sometimes lead to long-term effects, especially if you\u2019ve had multiple head injuries. Post-concussion syndrome can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including vision problems, dizziness, and disorientation. A neurologist specializing in TBI might be able to provide more insight.Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):FND is a condition where the brain has trouble sending and receiving signals properly, leading to symptoms like double vision, dizziness, and disorientation. It\u2019s often diagnosed after other conditions are ruled out, and it can be triggered by stress, trauma, or other factors. A neurologist familiar with FND might be able to evaluate this possibility.Autoimmune or Inflammatory Conditions:Conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) or other autoimmune disorders can cause episodes of double vision and neurological symptoms. While you\u2019ve had imaging done, it might be worth revisiting this possibility if new symptoms arise or if your episodes change in nature.Vestibular Migraines or Atypical Migraines:While migraines have been ruled out, vestibular migraines can sometimes present without headache and cause symptoms like double vision, dizziness, and disorientation. These can be tricky to diagnose and might require a specialist in headache disorders.Nutritional or Metabolic Factors:Since you\u2019ve had issues with vitamin D deficiency and peripheral neuropathy, it might be worth exploring other nutritional deficiencies (e.g., B vitamins, magnesium) or metabolic issues that could affect nerve function and vision.Next Steps:Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary: Continue tracking your episodes, including any potential triggers, the duration, and any new or changing symptoms. This can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for your doctors.Consider a Second Opinion: If you haven\u2019t already, seeking a second opinion from a different neurologist or a specialist in neuro-ophthalmology might provide new insights.Neuro-Ophthalmology Evaluation: A neuro-ophthalmologist specializes in vision problems related to the nervous system and might be able to offer a more targeted assessment.Explore Stress or Anxiety Management: Stress and anxiety can sometimes exacerbate neurological symptoms. While this isn\u2019t a direct cause, managing stress might help reduce the frequency or severity of episodes.Discuss Cost Concerns with Your Doctor: If cost is a barrier to seeing a specialist, let your primary care doctor know. They might be able to help prioritize tests or refer you to a clinic with sliding-scale fees.Final Thoughts:It\u2019s understandable to feel anxious and frustrated when dealing with unexplained symptoms, especially over such a long period. While it\u2019s good that your symptoms haven\u2019t worsened significantly, the recent change in the severity of your double vision is concerning and warrants further investigation. Don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek additional evaluations if needed.I hope you\u2019re able to find some answers and relief soon. Take care, and feel free to reach out if you need further support or suggestions."

        "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your brother's condition, and it's great that you're looking for ways to support him. While I'm not aware of a specific product that matches your exact description, there are a few options and adaptations that might help you achieve your goal safely:Gait Trainer or Support Walker with Harness:Some medical walkers or gait trainers are designed for individuals with mobility challenges and include harness systems to prevent falls. These are often used in rehabilitation settings and can support significant weight. Look for products like the Rifton Pacer Gait Trainer or Kaye Posture Walker, which can be customized with harnesses and supports. These devices are designed to provide stability and prevent falls.Fall Protection Harnesses:There are harnesses designed for fall prevention, often used in occupational safety or for individuals with mobility issues. These harnesses can be attached to a rolling walker or a ceiling-mounted track system (if used indoors). For outdoor use, you might consider a rollator walker with a harness attachment, though you may need to consult with a medical equipment specialist to ensure it can handle sudden falls.Custom Solutions:If off-the-shelf products don't meet your needs, you might consider working with a physical therapist or occupational therapist to design a custom solution. They can help you adapt existing equipment or recommend specialized devices.Weight Capacity and Safety:Ensure any device you choose is rated for your brother's weight and can handle sudden shocks. Look for products with a weight capacity of at least 300 lbs to provide a safety margin.Consult a Professional:It\u2019s a good idea to consult with a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or a medical equipment supplier. They can assess your brother's specific needs and recommend the safest and most effective equipment.If you're unable to find a suitable product, you might also consider indoor exercise options (like seated exercises or swimming, if accessible) to help with weight loss while minimizing fall risks. Always consult with his healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regimen.I hope this helps, and I wish you and your brother the best in finding a solution that works for him!"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The MRI findings describe multiple arterially enhancing lesions in your liver, with the largest measuring 1.8 cm. The imaging features suggest hepatic adenoma as the most likely diagnosis, with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) as another possibility. Here's how to interpret this:Key Findings:Arterially enhancing lesions: These lesions \"light up\" during the arterial phase of contrast imaging, which is typical of certain liver tumors like adenomas or FNH.Hyperintense on T2: This means the lesions appear bright on T2-weighted MRI images, which is consistent with adenomas or FNH.No internal fat: This rules out certain other liver lesions, such as some types of adenomas that contain fat.No definite washout: Washout is a feature often seen in malignant lesions like hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its absence is reassuring.Enhance less than background vessels on delayed phases: This argues against hemangioma, a common benign liver lesion.Likely Diagnosis:Hepatic adenoma: A benign liver tumor that is more common in women, especially those on hormonal medications (like Yaz, which you are taking). Adenomas can sometimes grow or bleed, so they need monitoring.Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH): Another benign liver lesion that is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment.Should You Worry?These lesions are likely benign, but they need further evaluation and monitoring because:Hepatic adenomas can rarely grow, bleed, or (very rarely) transform into malignancy, especially if they are larger than 5 cm. Yours are smaller, which is reassuring.Your history of chronic pancreatitis and medications (like hormonal birth control) may influence the behavior of these lesions.Next Steps:Consult a hepatologist or gastroenterologist: They can help interpret these findings in the context of your medical history and medications.Consider stopping hormonal medications: If these lesions are adenomas, Yaz (a hormonal birth control) may need to be discontinued, as it can promote their growth.Follow-up imaging: Repeat imaging (e.g., MRI or ultrasound) in 3-6 months to monitor for changes in size or appearance of the lesions.Biopsy (if needed): If the diagnosis remains unclear or if the lesions grow, a biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.Summary:The findings are likely benign (adenoma or FNH), but they require follow-up and possibly adjustments to your medications. This is not an emergency, but it is important to address it with your healthcare provider to ensure proper management."

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm very sorry to hear about your wife's experience and the loss of your baby. This is an incredibly difficult situation, and it's understandable that you're concerned about her health. Based on what you've described, here are some key points and considerations:Key Points:Seizures Post-C-Section:Your wife had her first-ever seizures shortly after a C-section, which were potentially linked to the spinal anesthesia (a rare complication known as post-dural puncture headache or intracranial hypotension). However, the MRI showed some activity in the front part of her brain, which is unusual and warrants further monitoring.Medication (Phenytoin):She was prescribed Phenytoin, an anti-epileptic drug, to prevent further seizures. While it seems to be working (no seizures in over a month), she is experiencing side effects like sensitivity to light, blurry vision, deep sleep, and now itching and vibrations.Recent Symptoms:Itching: This could be a side effect of Phenytoin, as itching (pruritus) is a known adverse reaction. However, it could also be due to other causes, such as hormonal changes post-pregnancy, stress, or even a neurological issue.Vibrations/Shaking: These sensations could be related to her nervous system, possibly a side effect of the medication or a sign of neurological activity (e.g., focal seizures or nerve irritation).Memory Loss: The memory gaps around the time of the seizures are not uncommon and are often due to the brain's disruption during the seizure activity.Risk of Seizures:The fact that she hasn't had a seizure in over a month is a positive sign. However, the recent symptoms (itching, vibrations) could indicate that her brain is still in a sensitive state. Lowering the Phenytoin dosage might have reduced some side effects but could also increase the risk of breakthrough seizures.Concerns and Next Steps:Phenytoin Side Effects:Phenytoin can cause a range of side effects, including drowsiness, blurred vision, and itching. The vibrations/shaking could also be related to the medication or her underlying neurological condition. Discuss these symptoms with her neurologist to determine if an alternative medication (e.g., Levetiracetam) might be better tolerated.Neurological Evaluation:The itching and vibrations could be neurological in origin. While Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a possibility, it is less likely given her age and lack of other typical MS symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, coordination issues). However, a follow-up with a neurologist is crucial to rule out other conditions like postpartum cerebral angiopathy, small seizures (focal seizures), or nerve irritation.Risk of Seizures:She is still at risk of seizures, especially since the dosage of Phenytoin was reduced. The vibrations/shaking could be a warning sign of focal seizures or increased brain activity. Keep a close eye on her and seek immediate medical attention if she experiences any unusual movements, loss of awareness, or worsening symptoms.Postpartum Hormonal Changes:Pregnancy and childbirth can cause significant hormonal shifts, which may contribute to her symptoms (e.g., itching, sleep disturbances). A consultation with an endocrinologist or her OB/GYN might help rule out hormonal imbalances.Psychological Support:The trauma of losing a baby and experiencing seizures can have a profound psychological impact. Consider seeking counseling or therapy for her (and yourself) to help process these events.Immediate Actions:Consult Her Neurologist: Share the new symptoms (itching, vibrations, shaking) and discuss whether further tests (e.g., EEG, repeat MRI) are needed.Monitor Closely: Keep a diary of her symptoms, including when they occur and how long they last. This will help her doctors identify patterns or triggers.Emergency Plan: If she experiences a seizure, ensure you know what to do (e.g., keep her safe, time the seizure, call for help if it lasts more than 5 minutes).Final Thoughts:Your wife's situation is complex, and it's important to address both the physical and emotional aspects of her recovery. While the risk of seizures remains, her symptoms could also be related to medication side effects or postpartum changes. Stay in close contact with her healthcare team and advocate for thorough follow-up care. You're doing a great job supporting her, but don't forget to take care of yourself too."

        "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What you're describing sounds like a complex and unusual experience, and while I\u2019m not a medical professional, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help you better understand or address this. The sensations you\u2019re experiencing\u2014tingling, emotional shifts (like dread or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu), hyperawareness, dizziness, and a light headache\u2014could potentially be related to a few different neurological or physiological phenomena. Here are some possibilities to consider:1. Focal Seizures or Simple Partial SeizuresThe sensations you describe (tingling, emotional shifts, hyperawareness, and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) are sometimes associated with focal seizures (also called partial seizures). These seizures originate in a specific part of the brain and don\u2019t always involve loss of consciousness or convulsions.The \"floaty\" or dizzy feeling afterward, along with the headache, could be part of the post-ictal phase (the recovery period after a seizure).Focal seizures can be caused by various factors, including stress, sleep deprivation, or underlying neurological conditions.What to do: If this hasn\u2019t been evaluated yet, it might be worth discussing with a neurologist. They may recommend an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check for abnormal brain activity.2. Migraine Aura or Silent MigraineWhile you mentioned that this feels different from your migraines with visual aura, some migraine variants (like silent migraines or migraine aura without headache) can cause neurological symptoms without the typical headache.Symptoms like tingling, dizziness, and altered perception of reality can sometimes be part of a migraine aura.What to do: Keep a detailed journal of these episodes, including triggers (e.g., stress, diet, sleep patterns) and symptoms. Share this with a doctor to see if migraines could be a factor.3. Anxiety or Panic AttacksThe emotional component (dread, hyperawareness) and physical sensations (tingling, dizziness) could also be related to anxiety or panic attacks. These episodes can sometimes feel very physical and overwhelming, even if there\u2019s no obvious emotional trigger.The \"floaty\" feeling afterward might be related to the body\u2019s response to a surge of adrenaline.What to do: If you suspect anxiety could be a factor, consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can help you explore coping strategies or determine if anxiety is contributing to these episodes.4. Dysautonomia or Autonomic DysfunctionConditions like dysautonomia (e.g., POTS\u2014postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) can cause dizziness, tingling, and altered perception due to issues with the autonomic nervous system.These symptoms can sometimes be triggered by changes in posture, stress, or dehydration.What to do: If you frequently experience dizziness or \"floaty\" sensations, it might be worth checking your blood pressure and heart rate during these episodes. A doctor can evaluate for autonomic dysfunction.5. Sensory Processing or DissociationThe hyperawareness and altered perception of reality could be related to dissociation or a heightened sensory processing state. This can sometimes occur during stress, fatigue, or as part of conditions like depersonalization-derealization disorder.The tingling and emotional shifts might be part of your body\u2019s response to stress or overwhelm.What to do: If dissociation feels like a possibility, a therapist or psychologist can help you explore this further.6. Other ConsiderationsHormonal fluctuations: Hormonal changes (e.g., related to your menstrual cycle) can sometimes cause neurological or sensory symptoms.Nutritional deficiencies: Low levels of vitamins like B12 or magnesium can cause tingling, dizziness, and neurological symptoms.Vestibular issues: Problems with the inner ear or balance system could contribute to dizziness and altered perception.Next Steps:Keep a Symptom Journal: Record details of each episode, including:What you were doing before it happened.How long it lasted.Specific symptoms (physical and emotional).Any potential triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, diet).Consult a Doctor: Start with your primary care physician, who may refer you to a neurologist or other specialist. Be sure to share your symptom journal.Rule Out Serious Causes: While these episodes don\u2019t seem to be causing lasting harm, it\u2019s important to rule out underlying conditions like seizures or migraines.Monitor for Changes: If the episodes become more frequent, severe, or start to include new symptoms (e.g., loss of consciousness, weakness, or speech difficulties), seek medical attention promptly.Final Thoughts:It\u2019s great that you\u2019re paying attention to these sensations and documenting them. While they sound unsettling, they don\u2019t necessarily indicate something dangerous, but it\u2019s always better to get them checked out. In the meantime, try to manage stress, stay hydrated, and maintain a regular sleep schedule, as these factors can influence neurological and sensory experiences.If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or anxious about these episodes, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a trusted healthcare provider or therapist for support. You\u2019re not alone, and there are ways to better understand and manage what you\u2019re experiencing."

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents.

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you've been facing with your epilepsy and mental health. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Let\u2019s break this down and try to make sense of what\u2019s happening.Key Points from Your History:Epilepsy Diagnosis: You were diagnosed with epilepsy in 2017 after a tonic-clonic seizure, following years of myoclonic seizures that weren\u2019t initially recognized as such.Medication History: You were on Lamotrigine and later Keppra, but after being seizure-free (except for myoclonic seizures during sleep deprivation), you were advised to stop medication in 2021 and 2022. However, after stopping, you had a major seizure in September 2022.Current Medication: You\u2019re now on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra twice daily, but you\u2019re still experiencing myoclonic seizures when trying to fall asleep, requiring Clobazam as a rescue medication.Mental Health: You\u2019ve struggled with depression, anxiety, possible BPD, eating disorders, and possibly ADHD or autism spectrum traits. These could be complicating factors in your treatment.EEG Results: Your EEGs show intermittent slowing in the fronto-temporal regions but no clear epileptiform abnormalities. The most recent EEG (April 2022) was normal.Why Things Might Have Gone Downhill:Medication Changes: Stopping or switching antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can sometimes destabilize seizure control, especially if the transition isn\u2019t managed carefully. In your case, the abrupt switch from Keppra to a very low dose of Lamotrigine (25mg) may have triggered breakthrough seizures.Sleep Deprivation: You mentioned that sleep deprivation is a major trigger for your myoclonic seizures. The night you had only 2 hours of sleep before the major seizure in September 2022 is a clear example of this. Poor sleep hygiene or stress could be contributing to ongoing issues.Inadequate Medication Dosing: The initial dose of Lamotrigine (25mg) was likely too low to provide adequate seizure control. Lamotrigine typically requires gradual titration to therapeutic doses (often 100-200mg/day or higher). Your current dose of 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra might still not be optimal for controlling myoclonic seizures.Underlying Epilepsy Type: Your history of myoclonic seizures and tonic-clonic seizures suggests you might have a generalized epilepsy syndrome, such as Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME). JME is highly sensitive to sleep deprivation and often requires lifelong treatment with specific AEDs like Valproate, Lamotrigine, or Levetiracetam (Keppra).Mental Health and Stress: Your mental health struggles could be exacerbating your epilepsy. Stress, anxiety, and depression are known seizure triggers and can also affect sleep quality, creating a vicious cycle.EEG Interpretation:Fronto-Temporal Slowing: This suggests some dysfunction in these brain regions, which could be related to your epilepsy. However, the absence of clear epileptiform discharges (spikes or sharp waves) doesn\u2019t rule out epilepsy, especially in generalized epilepsy syndromes.Normal EEG (April 2022): A normal EEG doesn\u2019t exclude epilepsy, as EEGs can be normal between seizures, especially in generalized epilepsy.What You Can Do:Seek a Second Opinion: Consider consulting an epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy) to review your case. They might have more experience with complex epilepsy syndromes and medication management.Optimize Medication: Your current regimen might need adjustment. For example:Lamotrigine: This is often effective for myoclonic seizures but requires careful titration. You might need a higher dose.Keppra: 1g twice daily is a standard dose, but some people need higher doses for full control.Clobazam: This is a good rescue medication, but if you\u2019re using it frequently, it might indicate that your baseline treatment isn\u2019t adequate.Address Sleep Issues: Prioritize good sleep hygiene. If you\u2019re struggling with insomnia or poor sleep, consider discussing this with your doctor. They might recommend a sleep study or adjustments to your routine.Mental Health Support: Addressing your mental health is crucial. Therapy (e.g., CBT, DBT) and possibly medication for anxiety/depression could help reduce stress and improve seizure control.Keep a Seizure Diary: Track your seizures, triggers (e.g., sleep deprivation, stress), and medication changes. This can help your neurologist tailor your treatment.Questions for Your Neurologist:Could my epilepsy be a generalized syndrome like JME?Is my current medication regimen optimal, or should we adjust the doses?Should we consider other medications, such as Valproate (if you\u2019re not planning pregnancy) or Brivaracetam (a newer alternative to Keppra)?How can we better manage myoclonic seizures during sleep?Final Thoughts:It\u2019s clear that your epilepsy and mental health are closely intertwined, and both need to be addressed holistically. Don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek out specialists who can provide more tailored care. You\u2019ve been through a lot, but with the right support and treatment, things can improve. Hang in there!"

        "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \\\"episode\\\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing this\u2014it sounds incredibly distressing and confusing. While I\u2019m not a doctor, the symptoms you\u2019re describing (one-sided numbness, difficulty communicating, severe headaches, light/sound sensitivity, and temporary vision loss) could potentially align with a neurological condition. Here are a few possibilities that might be worth exploring with a healthcare professional:1. Migraine with Aura (Hemiplegic Migraine)What it is: A type of migraine that can cause one-sided numbness, weakness, and sensory disturbances (like the \"line down the middle\" you described). It can also involve difficulty speaking, visual disturbances, and severe headaches.Why it fits: Your symptoms (numbness, headache, light/sound sensitivity, vision loss) are consistent with migraine aura. Hemiplegic migraines are a rare subtype that can mimic stroke-like symptoms.Next steps: Keep a detailed journal of your episodes (triggers, duration, symptoms) and consult a neurologist. They may consider migraine-specific treatments or preventive medications.2. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Mini-StrokeWhat it is: A temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, causing stroke-like symptoms that resolve within hours.Why it fits: One-sided numbness, speech difficulties, and vision loss can occur during a TIA. However, TIAs are less likely to recur so frequently without underlying risk factors (e.g., heart conditions, blood clotting disorders).Next steps: A neurologist might investigate vascular causes, such as blood clots or heart abnormalities, through imaging (e.g., MRI, CT scan) or blood tests.3. Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)What it is: A condition where the brain has trouble sending and receiving signals properly, leading to physical symptoms (e.g., numbness, weakness, speech issues) without structural damage.Why it fits: FND can cause episodic symptoms like yours, especially in individuals with a history of anxiety or other mental health conditions. Stress or emotional triggers might play a role.Next steps: A neurologist or psychologist specializing in FND could help explore this possibility. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or physical therapy might be recommended.4. Epilepsy (Focal Seizures)What it is: Seizures that originate in one part of the brain, causing localized symptoms like numbness, speech difficulties, or sensory changes.Why it fits: Focal seizures can cause one-sided symptoms and temporary loss of function. The post-episode headache and sensitivity to light/sound could be part of a post-ictal state.Next steps: An EEG (electroencephalogram) might help detect abnormal brain activity. A neurologist could evaluate whether anticonvulsant medications are appropriate.5. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Other Demyelinating ConditionsWhat it is: A condition where the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerves, causing neurological symptoms.Why it fits: MS can cause episodes of numbness, weakness, and sensory disturbances. However, MS typically involves other symptoms (e.g., balance issues, fatigue) and is less likely to present so episodically without progression.Next steps: A neurologist might consider an MRI to look for signs of demyelination.6. Complex Migraine or Stroke MimicsWhat it is: Some conditions, like vasospasm or cerebral vasculitis, can mimic stroke or migraine symptoms.Why it fits: These conditions can cause temporary neurological deficits and headaches.Next steps: A neurologist might investigate blood vessel abnormalities or autoimmune conditions.What You Can Do Now:See a Neurologist: A specialist can evaluate your symptoms in detail and order appropriate tests (e.g., MRI, EEG, blood work).Keep a Symptom Journal: Track when episodes occur, how long they last, potential triggers (stress, diet, sleep, etc.), and all symptoms.Consider a Second Opinion: If your previous tests were inconclusive, a fresh evaluation might help.Explore Migraine Management: Even if it\u2019s not migraines, some migraine treatments (e.g., magnesium, riboflavin, or prescription preventives) might help.Your symptoms are significant and deserve thorough investigation. While it\u2019s frustrating not to have answers yet, a neurologist with expertise in episodic neurological conditions is your best bet for getting to the bottom of this. Let me know if you\u2019d like help preparing for a doctor\u2019s appointment or finding resources!"

I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to feel concerned about your symptoms and the potential diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy, especially given the complexity of your medical history and the medications you're currently taking. Let\u2019s break this down step by step to help you better understand your situation:1. Your Symptoms and DiagnosisMotor Tics and ADHD: Your neurologist has diagnosed you with motor tics and ADHD based on your symptoms (shoulder jerks, whole-body movements, and head jerks) and your posture. Tics are sudden, repetitive, non-rhythmic movements or sounds, and they can sometimes be confused with myoclonic jerks (which are brief, shock-like muscle movements seen in epilepsy).EEG Results: Since your EEG was normal, this is a good sign that your jerks are less likely to be caused by epilepsy. EEG is a key tool for diagnosing epilepsy, and a normal result makes epilepsy less likely, though it doesn\u2019t completely rule it out in all cases.2. Medications PrescribedTetrabenazine: This is used to treat involuntary movements (like tics or chorea) by reducing dopamine levels in the brain. It\u2019s not typically used for epilepsy.Clonidine: This is often prescribed for ADHD and can also help with tics. It works by affecting certain neurotransmitters in the brain.Clonazepam: This is a benzodiazepine that can be used for both tics and epilepsy. It has muscle relaxant and anti-seizure properties, which is why it\u2019s prescribed for your jerks. The fact that it\u2019s used for myoclonic epilepsy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have epilepsy; it\u2019s just a versatile medication that can help with various movement disorders.3. Should You Be Worried About Epilepsy?Your neurologist hasn\u2019t ruled out epilepsy entirely, but the normal EEG and the diagnosis of motor tics suggest that epilepsy is less likely. Myoclonic epilepsy typically shows specific patterns on an EEG, so a normal result is reassuring.However, if your symptoms worsen or change (e.g., if you experience loss of consciousness, prolonged jerking, or other concerning symptoms), you should let your neurologist know. They may consider repeating the EEG or doing additional tests like a prolonged video EEG to monitor your brain activity over time.4. Next StepsMonitor Your Symptoms: Keep a diary of your jerks, noting when they occur, how long they last, and any triggers (e.g., stress, fatigue). This can help your doctor better understand your condition.Follow Up with Your Neurologist: If you\u2019re still concerned about epilepsy, discuss this with your doctor at your next appointment. They can explain why they suspect tics rather than epilepsy and whether further testing is needed.Take Medications as Prescribed: Stick to the treatment plan your doctor has given you. If you experience side effects or feel the medications aren\u2019t helping, let your doctor know.5. Key Points to RememberA normal EEG is a good sign and makes epilepsy less likely.Motor tics and myoclonic jerks can look similar, but they have different causes and treatments.Clonazepam is used for both tics and epilepsy, so its prescription doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have epilepsy.Stay in close communication with your neurologist and report any new or worsening symptoms.If you\u2019re still feeling anxious about the possibility of epilepsy, consider discussing your concerns with your neurologist in detail. They can provide more clarity based on your specific case. In the meantime, try to focus on managing your symptoms and following your treatment plan."

        "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\\\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry you're experiencing this uncomfortable sensation of air hunger\u2014it sounds distressing, especially given your background as a classical singer and your reliance on controlled breathing. While it's possible that this side effect may diminish as your body adjusts to Vyvanse, there are a few things you can try in the meantime to help manage it:1. Stay HydratedStimulant medications like Vyvanse can cause dehydration, which might exacerbate feelings of air hunger. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day.2. Practice Diaphragmatic BreathingSince you're already skilled in breath control, focus on diaphragmatic breathing (deep belly breathing) to ensure you're maximizing your lung capacity. Lie down or sit comfortably, place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen, and breathe deeply so that your abdomen rises more than your chest. This can help you feel more in control of your breathing.3. Mindfulness or Relaxation TechniquesAnxiety or tension can sometimes amplify the sensation of air hunger. Try mindfulness exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation to help calm your nervous system.4. Avoid OverstimulationStimulants can increase your sensitivity to stress or overstimulation, which might contribute to the feeling of air hunger. Try to create a calm environment and avoid excessive caffeine or other stimulants.5. Monitor Your Breathing RateSometimes, the sensation of air hunger can lead to overbreathing or hyperventilation, even if it doesn't feel like it. Use a timer or app to ensure you're breathing at a normal rate (about 12-16 breaths per minute).6. Consider a Lower DoseIf the air hunger persists or worsens, it might be worth discussing with your psychiatrist whether a lower dose of Vyvanse could help. Sometimes, side effects are dose-dependent, and a lower dose might still be effective for your ADHD symptoms without causing this issue.7. Rule Out Other CausesWhile the timing suggests Vyvanse is the likely cause, it\u2019s worth considering other potential contributors, such as:Anxiety: Even if you don\u2019t feel anxious, physical symptoms of anxiety can sometimes manifest as air hunger.Anemia or Iron Deficiency: These can cause feelings of breathlessness.Thyroid Issues: Hyperthyroidism can sometimes cause similar symptoms.Allergies or Asthma: If you have a history of either, they could be playing a role.8. Talk to Your PsychiatristIf the air hunger doesn\u2019t improve within a week or two, or if it becomes unbearable, let your psychiatrist know. They may want to adjust your medication or explore alternative treatments for your ADHD.9. Consider a Short-Term SolutionIf the sensation is particularly bothersome, you might ask your doctor about using a low-dose anti-anxiety medication (like hydroxyzine, which is non-addictive) temporarily to help ease the sensation while your body adjusts to Vyvanse.10. Track Your SymptomsKeep a journal of when the air hunger occurs, how long it lasts, and any triggers or patterns you notice. This can help your psychiatrist make more informed decisions about your treatment.It\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about your mental health and working closely with your care team. Hopefully, the air hunger will resolve as your body adjusts to the Vyvanse, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your psychiatrist if it continues to be an issue. They\u2019re there to help you find the right balance for your treatment."

It happened again last week and sometimes I do feel a bit drowsy or weird but haven't had a full on focal seizure again.What I experienced was:Nausea I saw an aura, or like static? on my right eye that then turned into colors.   My limbs went cold I had a deja vu sensation, like I started to think things I hadn't thought of in two years? I don't know how to explain it I lost all peripheral vision on my right eye for a good while.Speaking was difficult Almost lost consciousness (in 2020 I did lose consciousness and moved my eyes from side to side very rapidly and my face went droopy last time). Back then I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything. Since it never happened again I didn't go see a neurologist but the other day it happened twice so I immediately booked an appointment.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this, but it's good that you've booked an appointment with a neurologist. What you're describing sounds like it could be focal seizures (also called partial seizures), which originate in a specific part of the brain. The symptoms you mentioned\u2014aura, visual disturbances, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, nausea, cold limbs, difficulty speaking, and altered consciousness\u2014are common in focal seizures, particularly those originating in the temporal or occipital lobes.Here\u2019s some guidance to help you prepare for your appointment and manage your symptoms in the meantime:1. Keep a Detailed Symptom DiaryWrite down every episode, including:Date and timeDuration of symptomsSpecific symptoms (e.g., aura, visual changes, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, nausea, etc.)Any triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, bright lights, certain foods, etc.)How you felt before, during, and after the episodeThis will help your neurologist identify patterns and make a diagnosis.2. Avoid Potential TriggersSleep: Ensure you\u2019re getting enough rest. Sleep deprivation is a common seizure trigger.Stress: Practice stress management techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.Diet: Avoid excessive caffeine, alcohol, or any foods that seem to trigger symptoms.Hydration: Stay well-hydrated, as dehydration can sometimes contribute to neurological symptoms.3. Safety PrecautionsAvoid activities that could be dangerous if you lose consciousness, such as driving, swimming alone, or operating heavy machinery, until you\u2019ve seen your neurologist and have a clearer understanding of what\u2019s happening.Let someone close to you know about your symptoms so they can assist you if needed.4. Prepare for Your Neurologist AppointmentBring your symptom diary and any notes about your episodes.Mention your 2020 episode and the recent recurrence.Be ready to discuss your medical history, family history of seizures or neurological conditions, and any medications or supplements you\u2019re taking.Ask about diagnostic tests, such as:EEG (Electroencephalogram): To check for abnormal brain activity.MRI or CT scan: To rule out structural issues in the brain.Blood tests: To check for metabolic or hormonal imbalances.5. Possible Diagnoses to ExploreFocal seizures: These can be caused by epilepsy, brain injury, or other neurological conditions.Migraine with aura: Some of your symptoms (e.g., visual disturbances, nausea) overlap with migraines.Transient ischemic attack (TIA): A temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, though this is less likely given your symptoms.Other causes: Hormonal imbalances, electrolyte abnormalities, or even psychological factors like anxiety or panic attacks.6. What to Do If It Happens AgainStay calm and sit or lie down in a safe place.Focus on your breathing to avoid hyperventilation.If you lose consciousness or have a prolonged episode, seek emergency medical attention.7. Long-Term ManagementIf your neurologist diagnoses you with epilepsy or another condition, they may recommend:Anti-seizure medicationsLifestyle changesRegular follow-ups to monitor your conditionIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about your health. While waiting for your appointment, try to stay calm and avoid overloading yourself with stress or anxiety. Your neurologist will help you get to the bottom of this and provide a treatment plan if needed. Let me know if you have more questions!"

        "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you're dealing with a complex set of symptoms that have been ongoing for several years. While I can't provide a diagnosis, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help you better understand your situation and guide you toward appropriate care.Key Observations:Symptoms Timeline:Your symptoms began around age 7 with episodes of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) and vomiting at night.At age 12, after puberty, you experienced more pronounced symptoms, including difficulty understanding speech, depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (eyelid drooping), blurry vision, panic attacks, and food intolerances.At 19, the symptoms persist but are milder, often triggered by food intolerances and accompanied by sensory sensitivity, numbness, and panic.Food Intolerance Connection:Your symptoms seem closely tied to food intolerances, with significant improvement after passing stool. This suggests a possible gut-brain connection or a systemic reaction to certain foods.Neurological and Psychological Components:The symptoms you describe (AIWS, depersonalization, trembling, ptosis, blurry vision, and sensory sensitivity) could have neurological or psychological origins.The panic attacks and sensory overload might indicate an anxiety-related condition, such as PNES (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) or a heightened stress response.Possible Conditions to Consider:Migraine Variants: AIWS, blurry vision, and ptosis can be associated with migraine variants, even without a headache.Gut-Brain Axis Disorders: Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or food intolerances (e.g., gluten, histamine, or lactose intolerance) can cause systemic symptoms, including neurological and psychological effects.Autonomic Dysfunction: Symptoms like trembling, restricted circulation, and sensory sensitivity could point to dysautonomia (e.g., POTS or other autonomic nervous system issues).Anxiety or Panic Disorders: The panic attacks, depersonalization, and sensory overload might be linked to an anxiety disorder or heightened stress response.Histamine Intolerance or Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS): These conditions can cause a wide range of symptoms, including neurological, gastrointestinal, and psychological issues, often triggered by food.Next Steps:Consult a Specialist:Neurologist: To rule out or confirm migraine variants, seizures, or other neurological conditions.Gastroenterologist: To investigate potential food intolerances, IBS, or gut-related issues.Allergist/Immunologist: To explore histamine intolerance, MCAS, or other immune-related triggers.Psychiatrist or Psychologist: To address anxiety, panic attacks, and potential PNES.Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:Track your food intake, symptoms, and bowel movements to identify patterns or triggers.Note the timing, severity, and duration of symptoms.Consider Dietary Changes:Try an elimination diet (under medical supervision) to identify potential food triggers (e.g., gluten, dairy, histamine-rich foods).Explore low-histamine or anti-inflammatory diets if histamine intolerance or MCAS is suspected.Manage Stress and Anxiety:Practice relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, meditation, yoga) to reduce panic attacks and sensory overload.Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be helpful for managing anxiety and PNES.Medical Testing:Consider tests for food intolerances (e.g., IgG testing, elimination diet).Evaluate for autonomic dysfunction (e.g., tilt table test for POTS).Check for histamine intolerance or MCAS (e.g., serum tryptase, histamine levels).Final Thoughts:Your symptoms suggest a complex interplay between neurological, gastrointestinal, and psychological factors. Working with a multidisciplinary team of specialists can help you pinpoint the underlying causes and develop a tailored treatment plan. In the meantime, tracking your symptoms and avoiding known triggers may provide some relief. Don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek second opinions if needed\u2014your health and well-being are worth it."

        "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis and the challenges you're facing with Keppra. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your epilepsy and medication side effects, but I can offer some general advice that might help.1. Side Effects of KeppraFeeling foggy or \"drunk\" is a relatively common side effect of Keppra (levetiracetam), especially when starting the medication or adjusting the dose. Some people also report fatigue, dizziness, or mood changes.These side effects may improve over time as your body adjusts to the medication, but if they persist or worsen, it\u2019s important to discuss this with your doctor.2. Timing of DosesTaking Keppra once a day might not be ideal for maintaining stable blood levels of the medication, which could contribute to side effects or reduced effectiveness. Typically, Keppra is prescribed twice a day to keep levels consistent.If you\u2019re feeling foggy, consider splitting the dose back to 500mg twice a day (if your doctor agrees) to see if it helps reduce the side effects.3. Taking Keppra with FoodKeppra can be taken with or without food, but taking it with food might help reduce stomach upset or other side effects for some people.If you\u2019re feeling foggy after taking it, try taking it with a meal or snack to see if that helps.4. Time of DayIf drowsiness or fogginess is an issue, consider taking your dose before bed. This might help you sleep through some of the side effects.If you\u2019re taking it twice a day, you could take one dose in the morning with breakfast and the other at bedtime.5. Hydration and LifestyleStaying well-hydrated and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule can help reduce side effects.Avoid alcohol, as it can worsen drowsiness and interact with Keppra.6. Discuss Alternatives with Your DoctorIf Keppra continues to cause significant side effects, there are other anti-seizure medications your doctor might consider, such as lamotrigine, valproate, or brivaracetam (a newer medication similar to Keppra but with potentially fewer side effects).Never stop or adjust your medication without consulting your doctor, as this could increase the risk of seizures.7. Monitor and ReportKeep a journal of your symptoms, including when you take your medication, how you feel, and any side effects. This can help your doctor tailor your treatment plan.Next Steps:Talk to your neurologist about your side effects and ask if adjusting the dose or timing could help.Consider asking about alternative medications if Keppra continues to be problematic.Make sure your doctor is aware of your Motrin use, as it\u2019s important to monitor for any potential interactions (though Keppra and Motrin generally don\u2019t interact significantly).It\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about managing your health. Keep working with your healthcare team to find the best balance between controlling your seizures and minimizing side effects."

        "question": "Age - 30   Sex - male    Height - 5'8\\\"-174 cm    Weight - 60 kgs.    Duration of complaint - 3 years    Location - Soft palate    Any existing relevant medical issues - Subjective Tinnitus caused by olanzapine and an MRI scan   Current medications - Cinolazepam for sleep, Mysoline for the myoclonus. Is palatal myoclonus treatable?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Palatal myoclonus (PM) is a rare condition characterized by rhythmic, involuntary contractions of the soft palate. It can be classified into two types:Essential Palatal Myoclonus: Idiopathic (no clear cause) and often associated with an audible \"clicking\" sound due to the movement of the Eustachian tube.Symptomatic Palatal Myoclonus: Caused by underlying neurological conditions, such as brainstem lesions, multiple sclerosis, or trauma.Given your history of subjective tinnitus, olanzapine use, and myoclonus, it\u2019s possible that your palatal myoclonus could be related to your neurological or medication history. Here\u2019s an overview of treatment options:Treatment Options for Palatal Myoclonus:Medications:Clonazepam or other benzodiazepines may help reduce symptoms.Anticonvulsants like carbamazepine or gabapentin are sometimes used.Botulinum Toxin (Botox) Injections: These can be targeted to the soft palate muscles to reduce contractions. This is often considered when medications fail.Address Underlying Causes:If the myoclonus is linked to olanzapine or other medications, adjusting or discontinuing the drug (under medical supervision) may help.Treating any underlying neurological conditions (e.g., lesions detected on MRI) is crucial.Lifestyle and Supportive Measures:Stress management, as stress can exacerbate symptoms.Speech therapy or biofeedback may help in some cases.Surgical Options:In severe, refractory cases, surgical interventions like tensor veli palatini muscle sectioning may be considered, but this is rare.Next Steps:Consult a Neurologist: A specialist can reassess your condition, review your MRI findings, and determine if there\u2019s an underlying cause for the palatal myoclonus.Medication Review: Discuss with your doctor whether olanzapine or other medications could be contributing to your symptoms.Consider Botox: If medications are ineffective, Botox injections may be a viable option.Palatal myoclonus can be challenging to treat, but many patients find relief with a combination of medications, Botox, and addressing underlying causes. Work closely with your healthcare provider to tailor a treatment plan to your specific needs."

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information and suggestions based on what you've shared. Your case is complex and involves multiple systems (neurological, hematological, and possibly endocrine), so it\u2019s important to work closely with specialists who can coordinate your care. Here are some thoughts and considerations:1. Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)Your history of CVST in 2019 is significant, especially given your Factor V Leiden mutation, which increases your risk of blood clots. The CVST could have caused lasting effects on your brain, including the development of epilepsy and potential changes in blood flow or pressure in the brain.The fact that your migraines improved after starting Eliquis suggests that the CVST may have been contributing to your migraine symptoms. However, the ongoing neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, vision changes, temperature dysregulation) may indicate residual effects or other underlying issues.2. Epilepsy and SeizuresYour complex partial seizures originating in the right temporal lobe could be related to the CVST or other structural changes in your brain. Temporal lobe epilepsy can cause symptoms like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, zoning out, and speech disturbances (e.g., stuttering or repeating words).Keppra is a common antiseizure medication, but if your seizures are not fully controlled, your neurologist may consider other options. Since Zonisamide caused severe side effects, other medications like Lamotrigine or Lacosamide might be alternatives, but this would need to be discussed with your neurologist.3. Vision ChangesThe peripheral vision loss in your right eye could be related to the CVST or increased intracranial pressure at the time of the clot. It could also be unrelated (e.g., an optic nerve issue). A neuro-ophthalmologist might be helpful to evaluate this further.4. Temperature Dysregulation and Sleep IssuesTemperature regulation issues, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and exploding head syndrome could be related to dysfunction in the hypothalamus or brainstem, which regulate sleep and autonomic functions. These symptoms might also be linked to your epilepsy or the aftereffects of the CVST.A sleep study (polysomnography) might help rule out other sleep disorders, and an endocrinologist could evaluate your autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic function.5. Weight Gain and Hormonal FactorsThe weight gain since your CVST could be due to multiple factors, including reduced activity, medications (e.g., Keppra, propranolol), or hormonal changes. It might be worth checking thyroid function, cortisol levels, and other hormonal markers to rule out endocrine causes.6. Next StepsAdvanced Imaging: Since you have access to your MRIs, a neuroradiologist or a specialist at a center like Cornell could review them in detail to look for subtle changes or abnormalities that might explain your symptoms.Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation: A tertiary care center (e.g., Cornell, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins) would be ideal for coordinating care between neurology, hematology, endocrinology, and possibly psychiatry.Autonomic Testing: Given your temperature dysregulation and fainting episodes, autonomic testing (e.g., tilt table test) might be helpful.Genetic Counseling: Since you have Factor V Leiden, genetic counseling could provide more insight into your clotting risk and whether other genetic factors might be contributing to your symptoms.7. Covid ConcernsMany major medical centers are taking extensive precautions for in-person visits, and some offer telehealth consultations for initial evaluations. You could start with a virtual visit to discuss your case and determine the best next steps.8. Lifestyle and Symptom ManagementSleep Hygiene: Since sleep is a major issue, working with a sleep specialist or therapist to address your fear of sleep paralysis and improve sleep habits might help.Stress Management: Given the potential role of stress in exacerbating your symptoms, mindfulness, therapy, or relaxation techniques could be beneficial.Medication Review: Regularly review your medications with your doctors to ensure they\u2019re not contributing to your symptoms (e.g., propranolol can sometimes cause fatigue or temperature sensitivity).Final ThoughtsYour case is complex and likely requires a multidisciplinary approach. While it\u2019s understandable to want to avoid medical visits during Covid, your symptoms (e.g., seizures, vision changes, autonomic dysfunction) warrant a thorough evaluation. Starting with a virtual consultation at a major medical center could help you plan the next steps safely.If you\u2019d like, you can share specific MRI images (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, or contrast-enhanced views) for a more detailed look, but a neuroradiologist would be the best person to interpret them in the context of your clinical history.Let me know if you have further questions or need clarification!"

        "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

        "answer": "First, I\u2019m sorry to hear about the health challenges you\u2019ve faced over the past year, but I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re improving. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel concerned about the radiation exposure from the numerous imaging studies you underwent. Let\u2019s break this down and address your concerns in a clear, evidence-based way.Understanding Radiation Exposure from CT ScansCT scans use ionizing radiation, which can increase the risk of cancer over time. However, the risk is generally small and must be weighed against the benefits of diagnosing and treating serious medical conditions. The amount of radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv), and the Dose-Length Product (DLP) you provided can be converted to mSv using a conversion factor specific to the body region scanned.Here\u2019s a rough estimate of the radiation exposure for each of your scans:Head CT scans (August 16th, September 22nd, September 25th, December 15th):Conversion factor for head CT: ~0.0021 mSv/(mGy\u00b7cm)Estimated effective dose per scan: ~1.5\u20132.1 mSvTotal for 4 head CTs: ~6\u20138.4 mSvChest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT scans (September 23rd, November 15th):Conversion factor for body CT: ~0.015 mSv/(mGy\u00b7cm)Estimated effective dose per scan: ~9.8\u201319.4 mSvTotal for 2 body CTs: ~19.6\u201338.8 mSvPET scan (November 18th):PET scans typically deliver ~7\u201310 mSv of radiation.Estimated effective dose: ~7\u201310 mSvTotal Estimated Radiation ExposureAdding these up, your total estimated radiation exposure over the 6 months is approximately 32\u201357 mSv. This is a cumulative dose from all your scans.Comparing Your Exposure to Other GroupsRadiation Workers: The annual occupational limit for radiation workers is 50 mSv/year, with a 5-year average of 20 mSv/year. Your exposure is within this range but concentrated in a short period.Pilots and Flight Crew: They are exposed to ~3\u20136 mSv/year from cosmic radiation. Your exposure is higher but still within the range of what some frequent flyers or pilots might experience over a decade.Radiation Therapy Patients: Patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer receive thousands of mSv to targeted areas, far exceeding your exposure.Atomic Bomb Survivors: Survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who received 50\u2013100 mSv showed a slight increase in cancer risk over their lifetimes, but this is a different type of exposure (acute, whole-body).Cancer Risk from Your ExposureThe risk of cancer from radiation is typically estimated using a linear no-threshold model, which assumes that even small doses of radiation carry some risk. However, the risk is very small at the doses you received. For example:A cumulative dose of 100 mSv is associated with a ~1% increased lifetime risk of cancer. Your exposure is roughly half of this, so the additional risk is likely <1%.For comparison, the baseline lifetime risk of cancer in the general population is ~40%, so your exposure adds a very small increment to this.Key Points to Reassure YouYour exposure is not extreme: While you had multiple scans, your total dose is within the range of what some radiation workers or frequent flyers might experience over years.No immediate harm: The risks from radiation are long-term and probabilistic, not deterministic (i.e., they don\u2019t guarantee harm).Benefits outweighed risks: The scans were necessary to diagnose and manage your serious neurological symptoms. The information gained likely justified the radiation exposure.No evidence of harm at these doses: Studies of populations exposed to similar doses (e.g., radiation workers, frequent flyers) show no significant increase in cancer risk.Moving ForwardFocus on your recovery: Your health is improving, and that\u2019s the most important thing.Minimize future exposure: If you need imaging in the future, discuss with your doctor whether MRI or ultrasound (which don\u2019t use ionizing radiation) could be alternatives.Don\u2019t dwell on the past: The scans are done, and the additional cancer risk is minimal. Worrying about it won\u2019t change the outcome, but it could negatively impact your mental health.Final ThoughtsYour concerns are valid, but the data suggests your worries about cancer risk are likely overstated. Your exposure is not trivial, but it\u2019s also not in a range that would cause significant harm. Many people undergo similar or higher levels of radiation exposure over their lifetimes without ill effects. Focus on your recovery, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and try to let go of this worry. You\u2019ve been through a lot, and it\u2019s time to look forward."

        "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "t plays a crucial role in the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body's rest and digest functions. The vagus nerve helps regulate heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and even aspects of mood and stress response. It also facilitates communication between the brain and organs like the heart, lungs, and gut.What Does the Vagus Nerve Do?Digestion: It stimulates stomach acid production and gut motility, aiding digestion.Heart Rate and Blood Pressure: It helps lower heart rate and blood pressure by promoting relaxation.Stress and Anxiety: It influences the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA, which can help reduce anxiety and promote calmness.Inflammation: It plays a role in controlling inflammation through the inflammatory reflex.Does Stimulating the Vagus Nerve Have Benefits?Stimulating the vagus nerve has been studied for its potential therapeutic effects, and some evidence supports its benefits:Digestion: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can improve gut motility and reduce symptoms of conditions like gastroparesis.Blood Pressure: Techniques like deep breathing or VNS devices may help lower blood pressure in some individuals.Anxiety and Mood: VNS has been approved for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce anxiety by promoting relaxation.Inflammation: Research suggests VNS might help manage inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.However, the extent of these benefits can vary, and not all claims are equally supported by robust scientific evidence. Some methods of stimulation, like deep breathing, humming, or cold exposure, are low-risk and may provide mild benefits. Other methods, like implanted VNS devices, are more invasive and typically reserved for specific medical conditions.Is It Bullshit?Not entirely, but it\u2019s important to approach the hype critically. While vagus nerve stimulation shows promise, many claims are based on preliminary studies or anecdotal evidence. For example:Natural Stimulation: Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga are safe and may help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, but their effects are often subtle.Medical Devices: Implanted VNS devices are FDA-approved for specific conditions like epilepsy and depression, but they\u2019re not a cure-all.Overhyped Claims: Some wellness trends exaggerate the benefits of vagus nerve stimulation without strong evidence.For You Specifically:As a 35-year-old woman on sertraline (an SSRI for anxiety/depression), you might find relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation helpful for managing anxiety. However, always consult your healthcare provider before trying new therapies, especially if you have underlying health conditions.In summary, stimulating the vagus nerve isn\u2019t bullshit, but it\u2019s not a miracle cure either. Evidence-based methods can support overall well-being, but be cautious of exaggerated claims."

        "question": "i was diagnosed when i was young with a seizure thing that goes away when youre 13, which impairs my ability to concentrate and gave me seizures while im sleeping about once every blood moon and my mom told me it was epilepsy, but see the thing is that shes not very good with english, and i have never had any trouble with seeing flashing lights. is it possible to have epilepsy but no trouble with seeing flashing colors?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Yes, it is entirely possible to have epilepsy without being sensitive to flashing lights. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, but it manifests in many different ways, and not all people with epilepsy are affected by the same triggers.Key Points:Photosensitivity and Epilepsy: Sensitivity to flashing lights (photosensitivity) is a specific trigger for some people with epilepsy, but it is not a universal symptom. Only about 3-5% of people with epilepsy are photosensitive. This means the vast majority of people with epilepsy do not have seizures triggered by flashing lights.Types of Seizures: Epilepsy can cause various types of seizures, including focal (partial) seizures, generalized seizures, and absence seizures. Your description of having seizures while sleeping aligns with certain types of epilepsy, such as benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE), which often occurs during sleep and typically resolves by adolescence.Benign Rolandic Epilepsy: If you were diagnosed with a seizure disorder that was expected to resolve by around age 13, this sounds consistent with BRE. This condition is common in children and is characterized by seizures during sleep, often without other significant neurological issues. It is not typically associated with photosensitivity.Language Barriers and Diagnosis: If your mom struggled with English, it\u2019s possible there was some miscommunication about your diagnosis. However, epilepsy is a broad term, and the absence of photosensitivity does not rule it out. A neurologist would have made the diagnosis based on your seizure history, EEG results, and other factors.Next Steps: If you\u2019re still experiencing seizures or have concerns about your diagnosis, it\u2019s a good idea to consult a neurologist. They can review your medical history, perform tests if necessary, and clarify whether your condition aligns with epilepsy or another seizure disorder.In summary, yes, you can have epilepsy without being sensitive to flashing lights. Your symptoms and history suggest a specific type of epilepsy that may have resolved, but if you have ongoing concerns, a medical professional can provide clarity."

        "question": "Does radiation necrosis heal? 31 female 155 lbs Diagnosed w/ Brain AVM & 2 aneurysms 2009. - 3 gamma knife treatments in 2019. edications: Topamax, Trileptal, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Clonidine, Vyvanse, Vitamin D, Folic Acid & had Kyleena IUD replaced February 16th. - important because vision symptoms started could be coincidence. Shortly after I had my new iud put in I started having issues with my left eye, vision became blurry\u201dish\u201d on and off. For the next 3 weeks I Had slow thought processing during the time & some confusion. - Hard time finding words. I also had some \u201cleft neglect\u201d symptoms but that\u2019s normal for me when I get migraines because my left side goes numb so I related all of this to stress & the migraines until I started having muscle twitching in my left hand & wrist. - I started to improve end of March but My vision is still off sometimes & I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be. I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me? No one has ever told me I had radiation necrosis. I guess I was always under the assumption my brain would heal itself after my radiation\u2026 but 4 years later it just seems to be getting worse. Does radiation necrosis heal/is it dangerous? Could this just be swelling? Did is progress fast from January 2022-April 2023? 4.. Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as a ischemic stroke? What is FLAIR hyperintensity? Those are just questions off the top of my head. I don\u2019t see a dr until June and google is not my friend.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information to help you better understand your situation. Radiation necrosis is a known potential side effect of radiation therapy, including Gamma Knife treatments, and it can occur months to years after treatment. Here\u2019s a breakdown of your questions:1. Does radiation necrosis heal?Radiation necrosis can sometimes stabilize or improve over time, but it often does not fully heal on its own. The brain tissue damaged by radiation may not regenerate, but symptoms can sometimes be managed with treatments such as:Steroids (e.g., dexamethasone) to reduce inflammation and swelling.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy to promote healing in damaged tissue.Bevacizumab (Avastin), a medication that can reduce swelling and improve symptoms in some cases.Surgical removal of necrotic tissue in severe cases.2. Is radiation necrosis dangerous?Radiation necrosis can be serious, especially if it causes significant swelling or affects critical areas of the brain. Symptoms depend on the location and size of the necrotic tissue. Common symptoms include:Cognitive changes (e.g., memory issues, difficulty finding words).Vision problems.Weakness or numbness.Seizures.Headaches.If left untreated, it can lead to permanent neurological deficits. However, with proper management, many people can stabilize or improve.3. Could this just be swelling?Yes, swelling (edema) is a common feature of radiation necrosis. The MRI report likely mentions FLAIR hyperintensity, which often indicates swelling or fluid buildup in the brain tissue. Steroids are typically used to reduce this swelling.4. Did it progress fast from January 2022 to April 2023?Without seeing your MRI reports, it\u2019s hard to say how much progression occurred. Radiation necrosis can develop slowly over time, but changes in symptoms (e.g., vision issues, cognitive changes) may indicate progression. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will compare your MRIs to assess the rate of change.5. Is it similar to an ischemic stroke?Radiation necrosis and ischemic strokes both involve damage to brain tissue, but they have different causes:Radiation necrosis is caused by damage from radiation therapy.Ischemic stroke is caused by a lack of blood flow due to a blocked artery.In both cases, the affected brain tissue may not function properly, but the underlying mechanisms and treatments differ.6. What is FLAIR hyperintensity?FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is an MRI sequence used to highlight abnormalities in the brain. FLAIR hyperintensity refers to areas that appear brighter than normal on the scan, often indicating:Swelling (edema).Scarring or gliosis.Radiation necrosis.Other forms of tissue damage.7. Vision symptoms and IUD coincidence?It\u2019s unlikely that your Kyleena IUD directly caused your vision symptoms. However, hormonal changes can sometimes influence migraines or other neurological symptoms. Your vision issues are more likely related to the radiation necrosis or swelling in the brain, especially if the affected area is near the visual pathways.Next StepsDiscuss the MRI findings with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. They can explain the extent of the necrosis and whether it has progressed.Ask about treatment options to manage symptoms and reduce swelling.Monitor symptoms closely and report any new or worsening issues to your doctor.Key TakeawaysRadiation necrosis may not fully heal, but symptoms can often be managed.Swelling (edema) is a common feature and can be treated with steroids or other therapies.FLAIR hyperintensity on MRI indicates abnormal tissue, often due to swelling or scarring.Your vision and cognitive symptoms are likely related to the necrosis or swelling, not the IUD.It\u2019s important to follow up with your doctor to get a personalized treatment plan. If your symptoms worsen before your June appointment, consider reaching out to your care team sooner."

        "question": "Sex: M Age 48 Weight 235lbs Height: 6ft 2\\\" non smoker, non drinker epilepsy since birth, had his hemispheres separated about 15 years ago. Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your husband's struggles with epilepsy. It sounds like you're a very supportive partner, and it's clear that you're deeply invested in his well-being. While I\u2019m not a medical professional, I can provide some general information that might help you better understand his condition and explore potential avenues for improved management.Key Points to Consider:Increasing Seizure Frequency:The fact that your husband's seizures have been increasing over the past 7 years, despite adjustments to his medication, suggests that his current treatment plan may not be fully effective. This could indicate that his epilepsy is not well-controlled, and it might be time to seek a second opinion or explore alternative treatment options.Calcification on CT Scan:The area of calcification noted on the CT scan could be related to his epilepsy, especially if it\u2019s in a region of the brain associated with seizure activity. While his neurologist says it\u2019s unchanged, it\u2019s worth asking whether this calcification could be contributing to his seizures or if further imaging (like an MRI) might provide more insight.Headaches as a Warning Sign:The headaches your husband experiences before major seizures could be a type of prodrome (a warning sign that a seizure is coming). This is not uncommon in epilepsy, but it\u2019s important to document these patterns and share them with his neurologist. Tracking these headaches and seizures in a detailed diary (including timing, duration, and severity) could help identify triggers or patterns.Prolonged Postictal State:The prolonged postictal state (the recovery period after a seizure) following his major seizures is concerning, especially after the 15-minute seizure that required emergency care. Prolonged seizures (lasting more than 5 minutes) or clusters of seizures can be a medical emergency, so it\u2019s good that you called an ambulance in that situation.Medication Management:Your husband is taking Tegretol (carbamazepine), which is a common anti-seizure medication. However, if his seizures are worsening, it might be worth discussing with his neurologist whether a different medication or combination of medications could be more effective. There are many newer anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) available that might offer better control.Additionally, since he\u2019s also on an antidepressant, it\u2019s important to ensure there are no interactions between the two medications that could affect seizure control.Steps You Can Take:Seek a Second Opinion:Consider consulting with an epileptologist (a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy) or a comprehensive epilepsy center. They may offer more advanced diagnostic tools (like video EEG monitoring) or treatment options (like surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, or dietary therapies).Keep a Detailed Seizure Diary:Record the frequency, duration, and characteristics of his seizures, as well as any potential triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, missed medication, etc.). Also note the headaches and any other symptoms that precede or follow seizures. This information can be invaluable for his healthcare team.Explore Advanced Treatments:If medications alone aren\u2019t providing adequate control, other options to discuss with his doctor might include:Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS): A device implanted in the chest that sends electrical impulses to the brain to help reduce seizures.Ketogenic Diet: A high-fat, low-carb diet that has been shown to help some people with epilepsy.Surgical Options: If the seizures are localized to one area of the brain, surgery to remove or disconnect that area might be an option.Address the Headaches:Since the headaches seem to be a precursor to his seizures, ask his neurologist if treating the headaches more aggressively (e.g., with a migraine-specific medication) could help prevent or reduce the severity of the seizures.Emergency Plan:Make sure you have a clear plan in place for managing prolonged seizures (e.g., when to administer rescue medications like diazepam or lorazepam, and when to call for emergency help).Emotional and Practical Support:Living with epilepsy can be challenging for both the person with the condition and their loved ones. It\u2019s important to:Take care of your own mental and emotional health. Consider joining a support group for caregivers of people with epilepsy.Educate yourself about epilepsy and its management so you can advocate effectively for your husband.Ensure your husband feels supported and involved in decisions about his care.Final Thoughts:While epilepsy can be a lifelong condition, it\u2019s possible to improve seizure control and quality of life with the right treatment plan. Don\u2019t hesitate to push for more thorough evaluations or seek out specialists who can offer new perspectives. You\u2019re already doing a great job by paying close attention to his symptoms and seeking ways to help him\u2014keep advocating for his care!"

        "question": "i'm a caucasian 23 year old female, 5'6\\\" 115 lbs, taking oral BC, trintellix, vyvanse, keppra, and ranitidine (yeah, i kno). things like this have been going on for as long as i can remember. other than the fact that i'm epileptic, i really don't have any other underlying physical conditions that, to my knowledge, would cause this issue. i'm not really active unless you count standing around at work all day. i don't drink, smoke, or do any illicit drugs. i vape though...shhhh.so basically, i'm having what the title says. and when i mean constant, multiple times per day, anywhere on the body, with physical exertion or without.for example, today, i reached behind me to close a damn sliding cabinet door and got a wicked charley horse in my tricep. it throbbed for a few hours after. i'll lean my body to one side, maybe to reach for something further away and i'll get horrible contractions around my neck, upper back, shoulders, you name it. from seemingly normal and not excessively exerting actions.other times, i'll be sitting cross legged in bed, looking at reddit, and out of nowhere, my foot will flip out and the muscle that runs along the tendon on the bottom of the foot will tense like crazy and i'll have to stop what i'm doing to try to relax it, because as i'm sure a lot of people know, charley horses kinda continue to contract unless you move the body part in the opposite way or whatnot.i will get painful muscle contractions ANYWHERE. i get them in my throat muscles if i swallow something funny. i'll get them in my uterus (indiscriminate to my cycle and it feels way different than menstrual cramps). i'll get them in my BUTTHOLE MUSCLES. those are absolutely horrendous because i'll be in excruciating pain for 10-30 seconds and kind of have to position myself around and hold my breath until they relax. i get them in my fingers, wrists, calves, thighs, upper and lower abdomen, pretty much anywhere there's muscle.feel free to ask any other relative questions. i'm really just looking for insight and if anyone else is familiar with something like this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What you're describing\u2014frequent, painful muscle contractions (charley horses) in various parts of your body\u2014sounds like it could be related to a few potential underlying issues. While I can't provide a diagnosis, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help you and your healthcare provider investigate further.Possible Causes to Consider:Electrolyte Imbalances:Low levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, or sodium can cause muscle cramps and spasms. This is one of the most common causes of muscle cramps.Your medications (e.g., Keppra, Vyvanse, ranitidine) and oral contraceptives can sometimes affect electrolyte levels or hydration status.Medication Side Effects:Keppra (an antiepileptic drug) is known to cause muscle-related side effects, including cramps, in some people.Vyvanse (a stimulant) can lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, which might contribute to muscle cramps.Ranitidine (though less commonly used now due to safety concerns) can affect nutrient absorption, including minerals like magnesium and calcium.Dehydration:Even mild dehydration can lead to muscle cramps. Standing all day at work, vaping (which can dehydrate you), and not drinking enough water could contribute.Neurological Factors:Since you have epilepsy, there may be a neurological component to your muscle spasms. Abnormal electrical activity in the brain or nerves could potentially cause muscle contractions.Vitamin Deficiencies:Deficiencies in vitamin D or B vitamins can affect muscle function and lead to cramps.Muscle Overuse or Strain:Even though you're not highly active, standing all day or making repetitive movements could strain certain muscles, leading to cramps.Hormonal Factors:Oral contraceptives can sometimes affect muscle function or electrolyte balance, though this is less common.Underlying Muscle or Nerve Disorders:Conditions like myotonia (muscle stiffness), dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions), or peripheral neuropathy could cause similar symptoms. These would need to be evaluated by a neurologist.Vaping:While vaping is generally considered less harmful than smoking, it can still affect circulation and hydration, potentially contributing to muscle cramps.Next Steps:See Your Doctor:A thorough evaluation is essential. Your doctor may want to check your electrolyte levels, vitamin levels, and thyroid function, as well as review your medications for potential side effects.Keep a Symptom Diary:Track when and where the cramps occur, what you were doing, and any potential triggers (e.g., dehydration, certain movements). This can help identify patterns.Hydration and Diet:Ensure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.Consider increasing your intake of magnesium-rich foods (e.g., nuts, seeds, leafy greens) and potassium-rich foods (e.g., bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes).Supplements:If your doctor approves, you might try a magnesium supplement (e.g., magnesium glycinate) or a multivitamin to address potential deficiencies.Stretching and Gentle Exercise:Regular stretching, especially of the muscles that frequently cramp, might help. Gentle yoga or Pilates could improve muscle flexibility and reduce spasms.Neurological Evaluation:If your doctor suspects a neurological issue, they may refer you to a neurologist for further testing (e.g., EMG, nerve conduction studies).Questions for Your Doctor:Could my medications be contributing to these muscle cramps?Should I have my electrolyte and vitamin levels checked?Could my epilepsy or its treatment be playing a role in this?Are there any tests you recommend to rule out muscle or nerve disorders?Final Thoughts:Frequent, widespread muscle cramps like this are not normal and warrant further investigation. While it could be something as simple as an electrolyte imbalance or dehydration, it\u2019s important to rule out more serious underlying conditions. Make sure to advocate for yourself and push for a thorough evaluation if your symptoms persist or worsen.Let me know if you have more questions or need help preparing for your doctor\u2019s visit!"

        "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but based on what you're describing, it sounds like your symptoms could be related to epilepsy, specifically a type of seizure known as a focal aware seizure (previously called a simple partial seizure) or focal seizure with impaired awareness (complex partial seizure). These types of seizures can involve unusual sensations, emotions, or experiences, such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, intense fear, or panic, and they may not always involve the classic convulsions people associate with epilepsy.Here\u2019s why your symptoms might be related to epilepsy:D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and intense fear: These are classic symptoms of focal seizures, particularly those originating in the temporal lobe of the brain (temporal lobe epilepsy). The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feeling, overwhelming fear, and panic are often described as auras, which can precede a seizure or occur on their own.Confusion and memory gaps: After a focal seizure, it\u2019s common to feel confused or have trouble remembering what happened during the episode. This is called the postictal state.Sleep disturbances: Seizures can occur during sleep, and you mentioned experiencing these episodes while sleeping. This is not uncommon in epilepsy.Frequency and fatigue: Having multiple episodes in a short period (like the 5 you mentioned) and feeling exhausted afterward are also consistent with seizure activity.However, it\u2019s also possible that anxiety or panic attacks could be contributing to or mimicking some of these symptoms. Panic attacks can cause heart palpitations, hyperventilation, and intense fear, but they typically don\u2019t involve the same level of confusion or memory gaps as seizures.What you should do:Consult your neurologist: Since you have a history of epilepsy and are taking Levetiracetam, it\u2019s crucial to discuss these episodes with your neurologist. They may want to adjust your medication or investigate further.Keep a detailed diary: Record when these episodes happen, how long they last, what you experience, and any potential triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, etc.). This can help your doctor identify patterns and determine if these are seizures, panic attacks, or something else.Consider an EEG or video monitoring: Your doctor might recommend an electroencephalogram (EEG) or video EEG monitoring to capture brain activity during one of these episodes. This can help determine if they are seizures.Rule out other causes: Your doctor may also want to rule out other conditions, such as migraines, sleep disorders, or psychological issues, which can sometimes mimic seizure-like symptoms.Important:Don\u2019t stop or adjust your medication without consulting your doctor.If these episodes worsen or you experience a full-blown seizure, seek medical attention immediately.It\u2019s great that you\u2019re paying attention to these symptoms and seeking answers. Early intervention can help manage these episodes effectively and improve your quality of life."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand your symptoms and guide you on what to do next. Your symptoms are concerning and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what you\u2019ve described and potential considerations:Key Symptoms:Breathing-Related Sensations:Feeling of brain fullness or nourishment on inhalation.Lightheadedness, dizziness, and worsening symptoms on exhalation.Sensation of brain falling, vibrating, or electrical surges.Fear of a potential seizure-like event.Jerking/Twitching Episodes:Sudden, uncontrollable jerking of the body, jaw, and hands upon waking.Inability to speak or make sounds during these episodes.History of these episodes occurring for a long time.Other Relevant Information:Anemia (currently being treated with iron pills, beef liver pills, and blood-building supplements).Symptoms have been present for a week and are interfering with sleep.Possible Considerations:Anemia-Related Issues:Anemia can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue due to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain. However, your symptoms seem more complex and may not be fully explained by anemia alone.Over-supplementation with iron or other medications could potentially cause side effects, though this is less likely if you\u2019re taking prescribed doses.Neurological Concerns:The sensations in your brain, electrical feelings, and fear of seizures could indicate a neurological issue. While you\u2019re not epileptic, the jerking episodes you describe (especially upon waking) could be related to a seizure-like activity or a movement disorder.Conditions like hypnic jerks (normal muscle twitches during sleep) or myoclonus (sudden muscle spasms) could explain the jerking, but the severity and frequency you describe warrant further investigation.Respiratory or Circulatory Issues:The breathing-related symptoms could suggest a problem with oxygen or carbon dioxide levels in your blood. For example:Hyperventilation syndrome: Can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and strange sensations, though this is usually associated with rapid breathing.Dysautonomia: A dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can cause breathing-related symptoms and dizziness.Psychological Factors:Anxiety or panic disorders can sometimes cause sensations of dizziness, brain vibrations, or fear of seizures. However, this should only be considered after ruling out physical causes.Medication Side Effects:While iron supplements and blood-building pills are generally safe, they can sometimes cause side effects like dizziness or gastrointestinal issues. It\u2019s worth discussing your medications with your doctor to rule out any adverse reactions.What You Should Do:Seek Immediate Medical Attention:Your symptoms, especially the jerking episodes and brain sensations, could indicate a serious underlying condition. Visit a doctor or go to the emergency room if symptoms worsen or become unbearable.Consult a Neurologist:A neurologist can evaluate your symptoms, perform tests (e.g., EEG, MRI), and determine if there\u2019s a neurological cause for your sensations and jerking episodes.Monitor Your Symptoms:Keep a detailed diary of your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any triggers (e.g., stress, certain activities). This can help your doctor make a diagnosis.Review Your Medications:Bring all your current medications and supplements to your doctor to ensure they\u2019re not contributing to your symptoms.Rule Out Anemia Complications:Ask your doctor to check your hemoglobin, ferritin, and other blood levels to ensure your anemia is being adequately treated.Important Notes:Do not stop or change your medications without consulting your doctor.If you experience a prolonged episode of jerking, loss of consciousness, or severe dizziness, seek emergency care immediately.Your symptoms are complex and could be related to multiple systems (neurological, respiratory, circulatory). A thorough medical evaluation is essential to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment. Please prioritize seeing a healthcare professional as soon as possible."

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but based on what you've described, your experiences do seem to align with some of the symptoms and patterns associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is the most common form of focal epilepsy. Let me break this down and provide some insights that might help you better understand your situation:1. Grand Mal Seizures and Temporal Lobe EpilepsyGrand mal seizures (now called tonic-clonic seizures) can occur in various types of epilepsy, including TLE. However, TLE is often associated with focal seizures that start in the temporal lobe and may or may not generalize into a tonic-clonic seizure.The fact that your MRI was normal is not uncommon in TLE, as structural abnormalities (like hippocampal sclerosis) aren't always visible. However, the abnormal activity on your EEG (especially on the left side) is a significant finding and supports the possibility of epilepsy.2. Auras and Strange SensationsThe feelings you described before your seizures (nausea, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and the strange sensory experiences) are classic auras, which are actually focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures). These auras often originate in the temporal lobe.The sensory distortions you experienced as a child (sounds seeming aggressive, visual changes like the ceiling appearing far away or your hands looking bigger) are also consistent with temporal lobe seizures. These are sometimes referred to as dyscognitive or psychic symptoms of TLE.3. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and Memory-Related SymptomsFrequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes are a hallmark of TLE. These can occur as part of a seizure or as an isolated symptom. The feeling of \"knowing what's about to happen\" or recalling dreams in vivid detail is also common in TLE.Your childhood breakdowns (e.g., refusing to go to familiar places) could have been related to temporal lobe dysfunction, as this area of the brain is involved in emotion, memory, and perception.4. Tonsillectomy and InfectionsWhile it's hard to draw a direct connection, infections like mononucleosis (caused by the Epstein-Barr virus) and other illnesses can sometimes trigger or exacerbate neurological conditions, including epilepsy. The timing of your first seizure after the tonsillectomy might be coincidental, but it\u2019s worth discussing with your neurologist.5. Next StepsSince your investigations have been dragging on, it\u2019s important to advocate for yourself. Ask your neurologist about the possibility of temporal lobe epilepsy and whether further testing (e.g., a long-term video EEG) might help capture your seizures and confirm the diagnosis.If your current neurologist isn\u2019t specialized in epilepsy, consider seeking out an epileptologist (a neurologist with specialized training in epilepsy). They may be better equipped to interpret your symptoms and EEG findings.Keep a detailed seizure diary to track your symptoms, triggers, and any patterns. This can be invaluable for your doctor.6. Treatment and ManagementIf TLE is confirmed, the good news is that it is often manageable with anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Many people with TLE achieve good seizure control with the right medication.In cases where medication isn\u2019t effective, other options like surgery (e.g., removing the seizure focus in the temporal lobe) or neurostimulation devices (e.g., VNS or RNS) might be considered.7. Lifestyle ConsiderationsPay attention to potential seizure triggers, such as lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, or flashing lights.Maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular sleep, stress management, and avoiding excessive alcohol or recreational drugs.Final ThoughtsYour symptoms and history strongly suggest temporal lobe epilepsy, but only a neurologist can confirm this. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing your own research, as it can help you ask informed questions and advocate for your care. Don\u2019t hesitate to push for a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, as effective management can significantly improve your quality of life.If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"

        "answer": "Elevated eosinophil levels, known as eosinophilia, can be concerning, but it\u2019s good that you\u2019re already under medical care and have an appointment with a hematologist. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in immune responses, particularly against parasites and in allergic reactions. When levels are elevated without an obvious cause like an infection or allergy, it can indicate a range of conditions. Here are some possibilities your doctors might consider:1. Parasitic Infection (Even if Unlikely)Your neurologist mentioned this as a possibility. Even though you haven\u2019t been abroad, some parasites can be acquired locally (e.g., through contaminated food or water). However, if no parasite is found, this is less likely.2. Allergic or Atopic ConditionsWhile you mentioned you don\u2019t have allergies, sometimes subclinical allergic reactions or sensitivities (e.g., to food, medications, or environmental triggers) can cause elevated eosinophils. This might not always present with obvious symptoms.3. Medication-Related EosinophiliaSome medications can cause elevated eosinophil levels as a side effect. While your current medications (Topamax, Rivotril, Venlafaxine) are not commonly associated with eosinophilia, it\u2019s worth discussing with your hematologist whether any of your medications could be contributing.4. Autoimmune or Inflammatory ConditionsConditions like eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome) or other autoimmune disorders can cause elevated eosinophils. These are rare but may be considered if other symptoms develop.5. Hematologic DisordersElevated eosinophils can sometimes be associated with blood disorders, such as:Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES): A rare condition where eosinophils are persistently elevated and can cause tissue damage over time.Myeloproliferative Disorders: These involve abnormal growth of blood cells in the bone marrow.6. Other CausesAdrenal Insufficiency: Low cortisol levels can sometimes lead to elevated eosinophils.Cancer: In rare cases, certain cancers (e.g., lymphoma, leukemia) can cause eosinophilia.Idiopathic Eosinophilia: Sometimes, no specific cause is found, and the condition is monitored over time.Next StepsSince you\u2019re already scheduled to see a hematologist, they will likely perform additional tests to investigate the cause of your elevated eosinophils. These may include:Blood Tests: To rule out infections, autoimmune conditions, or hematologic disorders.Imaging: If there\u2019s concern about organ involvement (e.g., lungs, heart).Bone Marrow Biopsy: In rare cases, if a blood disorder is suspected.What You Can Do NowKeep track of any new or worsening symptoms (e.g., rashes, breathing difficulties, fatigue, weight loss).Ensure your hematologist has access to your full medical history and current medications.Try not to worry too much\u2014elevated eosinophils can have many causes, and some are benign or easily treatable.Your hematologist will be in the best position to interpret your results in the context of your overall health and guide you further. In the meantime, focus on managing your epilepsy and side effects from your current medications. Let me know if you have more questions!"

        "question": "I get a \\\"flash\\\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \\\"cannot compute\\\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",

        "answer": "What you're describing\u2014brief sensory or cognitive disturbances triggered by specific thoughts or memories\u2014could potentially be related to a neurological phenomenon, but it doesn't necessarily sound like a classic presentation of epilepsy. Epileptic seizures typically involve more pronounced and consistent symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, muscle spasms, or repetitive movements, and they often have a more predictable pattern. However, there are some types of seizures or neurological conditions that might present in more subtle ways, such as focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures), which can cause brief sensory or cognitive disturbances without loss of consciousness.Here are a few possibilities to consider:Focal Aware Seizures: These seizures can cause brief sensory, emotional, or cognitive symptoms without loss of consciousness. They might involve d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, ringing in the ears, or a sudden feeling of disorientation. If these episodes are brief and don't impair your daily functioning, they might go unnoticed or be dismissed as \"weird moments.\"Sensory Processing or Neurological Quirk: Your brain might have a unique way of processing certain memories or sensory inputs, leading to these brief \"flashes\" or disorienting moments. This could be related to how your brain handles nostalgia or time-based memories, especially if it involves strong emotional or sensory associations.Migraine Aura: Some people experience sensory disturbances (like ringing in the ears, visual changes, or disorientation) as part of a migraine aura, even without a headache. These can be triggered by stress, sensory overload, or other factors.Temporal Lobe Involvement: The temporal lobe is involved in memory, emotion, and sensory processing. If there's any unusual activity in this area, it could lead to symptoms like those you're describing. This could be related to seizures, migraines, or other neurological conditions.Psychological or Emotional Trigger: Sometimes, strong emotional responses to memories or sensory cues can cause physical sensations, such as ringing in the ears or a feeling of disorientation. This might be more related to how your brain processes emotions tied to specific memories.Since your doctor hasn't been concerned, it's possible that these episodes are benign and not indicative of a serious condition. However, if these episodes become more frequent, intense, or disruptive, or if you develop additional symptoms (e.g., loss of consciousness, confusion, or motor symptoms), it would be worth seeking a second opinion or consulting a neurologist.In the meantime, you might consider keeping a detailed journal of these episodes, noting:What you were thinking about or doing when it happened.The specific sensations you experienced.How long the episode lasted.Any other factors (e.g., stress, fatigue, hunger) that might have contributed.This information could be helpful if you decide to pursue further evaluation in the future."

        "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you would be concerned about the potential risks given your medical history. Here are some key points to consider:Medical History: You had epilepsy as a very young child, but it has been over 20 years since your last seizure. This is a significant period without any episodes, which is a positive sign.Consult a Neurologist: Before undergoing any procedure that involves a stun gun, it would be wise to consult with a neurologist. They can provide a professional assessment of your current neurological health and the potential risks involved.Stun Gun Effects: Stun guns deliver an electric shock that can cause temporary loss of muscle control and intense pain, but they are generally designed to be non-lethal and not cause long-term damage. However, the electrical discharge can potentially trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.Risk Assessment: Your risk of having a seizure triggered by a stun gun is difficult to assess without a thorough medical evaluation. Factors such as the stability of your neurological condition, the presence of any underlying issues, and the specifics of the stun gun's electrical output would all play a role.Informed Decision: Make sure you are fully informed about the procedure and its potential risks. Discuss with your potential employer and medical professionals to understand all aspects of the test.Alternative Options: If the risk is deemed too high, inquire if there are alternative tests or accommodations that can be made to fulfill the job requirements without exposing you to potential harm.In summary, while your long period without seizures is a good sign, the potential risk should not be ignored. Consulting with a neurologist and having a thorough medical evaluation is the best course of action to make an informed decision."

        "question": "I am a 23 year old women I was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease and other chronic inflammation about 8 years ago, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy, on top of that I have cysts throughout my body. I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your health challenges, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re seeking more information to better understand your conditions. Let\u2019s address your two questions:1) Connection Between Inflammation and EpilepsyThere is growing evidence that inflammation may play a role in the development and progression of epilepsy, particularly in certain types of seizures or epilepsy syndromes. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what is known:Neuroinflammation and Seizures: Chronic inflammation, whether systemic (throughout the body) or localized in the brain, can contribute to the development of epilepsy. Inflammatory molecules (like cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins) can disrupt the blood-brain barrier, alter neuronal excitability, and promote seizures. This is sometimes referred to as \"inflammatory epilepsy.\"Crohn\u2019s Disease and Epilepsy: Crohn\u2019s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition, and systemic inflammation from Crohn\u2019s could theoretically contribute to neuroinflammation. While the direct link between Crohn\u2019s and epilepsy isn\u2019t fully established, chronic inflammation in the body can have widespread effects, including on the brain.Autoimmune and Inflammatory Epilepsy: Some forms of epilepsy are directly linked to autoimmune conditions, where the immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue. Conditions like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or lupus can cause both inflammation and seizures. While Crohn\u2019s is not typically associated with these specific autoimmune epilepsies, the general inflammatory state could still play a role.Research and Leads: You might want to look into studies on neuroinflammation and epilepsy or systemic inflammation and seizures. Some key areas of research include the role of IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin-1 beta), TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and other inflammatory markers in epilepsy. Additionally, the concept of \"seizure-induced inflammation\" and \"inflammation-induced seizures\" is an area of active investigation.2) Connection Between Cysts and InflammationCysts can sometimes be linked to chronic inflammation, depending on their type and location. Here\u2019s how inflammation might play a role:Inflammation and Cyst Formation: Chronic inflammation can lead to tissue damage and the formation of cysts in some cases. For example, in conditions like endometriosis (which involves chronic inflammation), cysts can form as a result of inflammatory processes. Similarly, in the liver or kidneys, chronic inflammation can sometimes lead to cyst development.Types of Cysts: The connection between inflammation and cysts depends on the type of cyst. For example:Pilonidal cysts: Often linked to chronic inflammation and infection in the skin.Ovarian cysts: Some types, like endometriomas, are directly linked to inflammation (e.g., endometriosis).Ganglion cysts: These are typically not inflammatory but are caused by joint or tendon irritation.Renal or liver cysts: Inflammatory conditions like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) or chronic liver inflammation can lead to cyst formation.Crohn\u2019s Disease and Cysts: Crohn\u2019s disease primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, but the systemic inflammation it causes could theoretically contribute to cyst formation in other parts of the body. However, this would depend on the specific type and location of the cysts.Next StepsConsult Specialists: Since your case involves multiple complex conditions, it\u2019s important to work with a multidisciplinary team, including a neurologist, gastroenterologist, and possibly a rheumatologist or immunologist. They can help explore potential connections and tailor treatment to address both inflammation and epilepsy.Inflammatory Markers: Ask your doctors about testing for inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, ESR, cytokines) to better understand the level of systemic inflammation in your body.Imaging and Biopsies: If the cysts are concerning, imaging (e.g., ultrasound, MRI) or biopsies might be needed to determine their cause and whether they are linked to inflammation.Anti-Inflammatory Therapies: Discuss whether anti-inflammatory treatments (e.g., biologics, corticosteroids, or dietary interventions) could help manage both your Crohn\u2019s disease and potentially reduce the risk of seizures or cyst formation.Final ThoughtsThe interplay between chronic inflammation, epilepsy, and cysts is complex and not fully understood. However, there is enough evidence to suggest that inflammation could be a common thread in your conditions. By addressing systemic inflammation, you may be able to improve your overall health and potentially reduce the impact of these conditions. Keep working closely with your healthcare team, and consider seeking out specialists who have experience with complex, overlapping conditions.Let me know if you\u2019d like help finding specific studies or resources!"

        "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \\\"SELENICA-R 40%\\\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m sorry to hear about the challenges you\u2019ve been facing. Your symptoms\u2014dizziness, motor function issues, speech difficulties, and joint pain\u2014are complex and could have multiple potential causes. It\u2019s good that you\u2019ve already undergone extensive testing (MRI, blood work, ENT consultation, etc.), but it seems like the underlying cause hasn\u2019t been identified yet. Let\u2019s break this down and address your concerns:1. Selenica-R (Sodium Valproate)What it is: Selenica-R is a Japanese-branded medication containing sodium valproate, an anticonvulsant primarily used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and sometimes migraines. It works by stabilizing electrical activity in the brain.Why it might have been prescribed: Your doctor may suspect that your symptoms (dizziness, speech issues, motor dysfunction) could be related to abnormal brain activity or a neurological condition. Sodium valproate can help if your symptoms are linked to something like migraine-associated vertigo, seizures, or other neurological issues.Is it appropriate for you? Without a clear diagnosis, it\u2019s hard to say. Sodium valproate is not typically a first-line treatment for dizziness or motor issues unless there\u2019s evidence of a neurological cause. If your doctor suspects a neurological condition (e.g., epilepsy, migraines, or a functional neurological disorder), it might be worth trying. However, it\u2019s important to discuss the rationale for this prescription and whether there are other diagnostic steps to take first.Side effects to be aware of: Sodium valproate can cause drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, weight gain, and, in rare cases, liver or pancreatic issues. Since you\u2019re already experiencing dizziness, this medication could potentially worsen it initially.2. Possible Causes of Your SymptomsYour symptoms (dizziness, motor issues, speech problems, joint pain) could stem from a variety of conditions. Some possibilities include:Neurological issues:Migraine-associated vertigo or vestibular migraines (can cause dizziness and speech issues).Functional neurological disorder (FND), where stress or psychological factors manifest as physical symptoms.Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other demyelinating diseases (though an MRI would likely have shown signs).Small fiber neuropathy (can cause sensory and motor issues).Autoimmune conditions:Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune diseases can cause joint pain, dizziness, and neurological symptoms.Metabolic or nutritional deficiencies:Magnesium is important, but excessive intake (2000mg/day) can cause side effects like dizziness, muscle weakness, and cramping. Have your magnesium levels been checked? High doses can also interact with other medications.Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms like dizziness, motor issues, and speech problems.Psychiatric or stress-related causes:Chronic anxiety or depression can manifest with physical symptoms like dizziness, muscle tension, and motor dysfunction.Structural issues:A pinched nerve or herniated disc could explain some motor issues or pain but wouldn\u2019t fully account for dizziness or speech problems.3. Next StepsDiscuss the medication with your doctor: Ask why they prescribed Selenica-R and what condition they suspect it will treat. Request clarification on whether this is a diagnostic trial or a long-term treatment plan.Consider a neurologist or multidisciplinary approach: Since your symptoms span multiple systems (neurological, musculoskeletal, sensory), a neurologist or a clinic specializing in complex cases might be helpful.Review your magnesium intake: 2000mg/day is a very high dose and could contribute to symptoms like dizziness, muscle weakness, and cramping. Have your magnesium levels checked to ensure you\u2019re not over-supplementing.Explore other diagnostic avenues:Consider testing for autoimmune conditions (e.g., ANA, rheumatoid factor).Check for vitamin deficiencies (B12, vitamin D, etc.).If dizziness is a primary symptom, a vestibular specialist or additional ENT evaluation might help.4. KAMPO (Traditional Japanese Medicine)KAMPO is often used in Japan for various conditions, but its effectiveness varies. If it didn\u2019t help, it\u2019s reasonable to move on to other treatments. However, it\u2019s worth noting that KAMPO is generally considered safe and low-risk.5. Final ThoughtsSelenica-R (sodium valproate) is not inherently inappropriate, but its use should be based on a clear hypothesis about your condition. If your doctor suspects a neurological cause, it might be worth trying, but make sure you understand the reasoning.Your symptoms are complex and could have multiple overlapping causes. A thorough, systematic approach to diagnosis is key. Consider seeking a second opinion if you feel your concerns aren\u2019t being fully addressed.Hang in there\u2014it\u2019s frustrating to deal with unresolved symptoms, but with persistence, you\u2019re likely to find answers and relief. Let me know if you have more questions or need further clarification!"

        "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds.

I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, which are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Here\u2019s a breakdown of your questions:1. Can Epilepsy Happen for No Reason?Epilepsy can sometimes occur without a clear underlying cause, which is referred to as idiopathic epilepsy. In many cases, it may be due to genetic predisposition or subtle brain abnormalities that aren\u2019t easily detectable.However, epilepsy can also result from identifiable causes such as brain injury, stroke, infections, tumors, or developmental disorders. In some cases, it may be due to a \"misfunctioning\" in the brain, as you mentioned, where the brain's electrical activity becomes disrupted.2. Family History and RiskHaving a family member with epilepsy (like your mom\u2019s cousin) can slightly increase your risk, but it doesn\u2019t mean you are destined to develop the condition. Epilepsy is not typically inherited in a straightforward Mendelian pattern, but certain genetic factors can contribute to susceptibility.The risk for your mom\u2019s cousin\u2019s children would depend on whether the epilepsy was due to a genetic cause or an external factor (like an injury or infection). If it was genetic, his children might have a slightly higher risk, but it\u2019s not guaranteed.3. Medications and Epilepsy RiskMost medications for depression or anxiety, including Citalopram (an SSRI), do not directly cause epilepsy. However, in rare cases, certain medications can lower the seizure threshold, making seizures more likely in people who are already predisposed to them.If you have no history of seizures or epilepsy, the risk of developing epilepsy due to these medications is very low. Always discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider, especially if you have a family history of epilepsy.4. Lifestyle FactorsSmoking and heavy alcohol use can increase the risk of seizures and epilepsy, as they can affect brain function and lower the seizure threshold. If you don\u2019t smoke or drink heavily, this is less of a concern for you.Other factors like sleep deprivation, stress, or recreational drug use can also trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.5. What Should You Do?If you\u2019re concerned about your risk, consider discussing your family history with a neurologist. They can provide personalized advice and determine if any further evaluation (like an EEG or imaging) is needed.Since you\u2019re on HRT, ensure your healthcare provider is aware of your full medical history, as hormonal changes can sometimes influence neurological conditions.6. General AwarenessEpilepsy is a manageable condition for most people with proper treatment, including medications, lifestyle adjustments, and sometimes surgery. The fact that your mom\u2019s cousin died from epilepsy is tragic, but it\u2019s important to remember that outcomes vary widely, and many people with epilepsy live full, healthy lives.In summary, while your family history slightly increases your risk, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in significant danger. Medications like Citalopram are generally safe, but always monitor for any unusual symptoms and stay in close communication with your healthcare provider. If you\u2019re ever concerned about seizures or other neurological symptoms, seek medical advice promptly."

        "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about your reaction to flashing lights, but let's break this down step by step:Flashing Lights and Discomfort: It's not uncommon for flashing or strobe lights to cause discomfort, even in people without epilepsy. Many people experience feelings of being off, dizziness, or unease when exposed to intense or rapid light changes. This doesn't necessarily mean you have epilepsy.Photosensitive Epilepsy: A small percentage of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy, where flashing lights or specific visual patterns can trigger seizures. However, most people with epilepsy do not have this type, and most people who feel uncomfortable with flashing lights do not have epilepsy at all.Your Experience: You mentioned feeling uncomfortable and a sense of impending doom during the flashing lights but did not experience a seizure or lose consciousness. This suggests that while you may be sensitive to flashing lights, it doesn't necessarily indicate epilepsy. The impending doom feeling could be anxiety or a physiological response to the overstimulation.Epilepsy Test Video: Forcing yourself to watch a flashing light video is not a reliable way to diagnose epilepsy. These videos are typically used in controlled medical settings (like an EEG) to test for photosensitivity. Watching such a video at home could cause discomfort or anxiety but does not increase your risk of developing epilepsy.Risk of Developing Epilepsy: Watching flashing lights does not make you more susceptible to epilepsy. Epilepsy is typically caused by genetic factors, brain injuries, infections, or other neurological conditions, not by exposure to flashing lights.What Should You Do?Monitor Symptoms: If you continue to feel off or experience other unusual symptoms (e.g., unexplained confusion, staring spells, or involuntary movements), it\u2019s worth discussing with a healthcare provider.Avoid Triggers: If flashing lights consistently bother you, it\u2019s reasonable to avoid them or limit exposure.Consult a Doctor: If you\u2019re genuinely concerned, a neurologist can evaluate your symptoms and, if necessary, perform tests like an EEG to rule out epilepsy or other conditions.Bottom LineFeeling uncomfortable around flashing lights doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have epilepsy. Many people find such stimuli overwhelming or unpleasant. However, if you\u2019re concerned or experience other symptoms, it\u2019s always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for peace of mind."

        "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand your situation better. It sounds like you're experiencing episodes that could indeed be related to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or another neurological condition. Here are some key points to consider:1. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and MRIMRI and Epilepsy: An MRI can detect structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, scars, or malformations, which might be causing seizures. However, in some cases of epilepsy, especially TLE, the MRI can appear normal because the underlying cause might be related to subtle changes in brain activity or microscopic abnormalities that aren't visible on imaging.Normal MRI Doesn't Rule Out Epilepsy: A clear MRI doesn't necessarily rule out epilepsy. If your symptoms strongly suggest TLE, your doctor might still consider it as a diagnosis based on your clinical history.2. Symptoms You DescribedThe symptoms you're describing\u2014dizziness, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, blurred vision, slurred speech, hot flushes, and feeling zoned out\u2014are indeed consistent with temporal lobe seizures. These types of seizures often involve sensory, emotional, or memory-related symptoms rather than the classic convulsions people associate with epilepsy.The fact that you forget what happens during the episodes is also common in seizures, as they can affect memory formation during the event.3. Increased Frequency of EpisodesThe fact that you had three episodes in one day is concerning and suggests that whatever is causing these episodes might be progressing or becoming more frequent. This is a valid reason to seek further medical evaluation.4. Next StepsSee a Neurologist: If you haven't already, ask your doctor for a referral to a neurologist, preferably one who specializes in epilepsy. They can perform a more detailed evaluation, including an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain activity and can help detect abnormal electrical patterns associated with seizures.Keep a Symptom Diary: Document your episodes in detail, including triggers, duration, and symptoms. This can help your doctor identify patterns and make a more accurate diagnosis.Consider a Second Opinion: If your current doctor isn't taking your symptoms seriously, it might be worth seeking a second opinion, especially given the increased frequency of your episodes.5. Should You Be Worried?While it's understandable to feel concerned, try not to panic. Many people with epilepsy or similar conditions live normal lives with proper treatment. However, it's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, as untreated seizures can potentially worsen over time or lead to complications.6. Other PossibilitiesMigraines: Some types of migraines (e.g., migraine with aura) can cause similar symptoms, such as visual disturbances, dizziness, and confusion. However, migraines typically last longer than a few minutes and are often accompanied by headaches.Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES): These are episodes that resemble seizures but are caused by psychological factors rather than abnormal brain activity. An EEG can help differentiate between PNES and epilepsy.ConclusionYou should take your symptoms seriously, especially since they are becoming more frequent. While a clear MRI is reassuring, it doesn't rule out epilepsy or other neurological conditions. Push for further testing, such as an EEG, and consult a neurologist to get a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, avoid activities that could be dangerous if you have an episode, such as driving or operating heavy machinery, until you have a diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "question": "My current age is 31. Height: 5'7\\\" Weight: 140 lbs. I have been having convulsive seizures almost every month since I turned 26. These seizures almost exclusively occur within an hour of waking up. I walk around the house for up to half an hour, burning up. Could stress be a trigger for these episodes? I also have times where I get euphoric and nauseous, but they never last very long.Basically, what I want to know is, what is going on in my head. Is this temporal lobe epilepsy? Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand your situation better. However, it\u2019s crucial to consult a neurologist or epilepsy specialist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.Key Points from Your Description:Seizure Pattern: Your seizures occur almost exclusively within an hour of waking up, which is a common pattern in certain types of epilepsy, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) or temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The fact that they happen upon waking suggests a possible link to sleep-wake transitions, which can lower the seizure threshold.Symptoms: You describe convulsive seizures, episodes of walking around (possibly automatisms or complex partial seizures), feelings of euphoria, nausea, and burning sensations. These symptoms could suggest focal onset seizures (originating in a specific part of the brain) with possible secondary generalization (spreading to the entire brain).Stress as a Trigger: Stress is a well-known trigger for seizures in many people with epilepsy. If you notice a correlation between stressful periods and increased seizure activity, stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, therapy, or relaxation exercises) might help.Medication Resistance: Keppra (levetiracetam) is not working for you, which is not uncommon. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have drug-resistant seizures. There are many other anticonvulsants to try, and your neurologist can guide you through this process.Possible Conditions:Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):TLE often involves focal seizures with altered awareness, automatisms (e.g., walking around), and sensory or emotional symptoms (e.g., euphoria, nausea).Seizures in TLE can secondarily generalize, leading to convulsions.Focal Onset Seizures with Secondary Generalization:This describes seizures that start in one area of the brain (e.g., temporal lobe) and spread, causing convulsions.Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME):JME typically starts in adolescence and involves myoclonic jerks, absence seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, often upon waking. However, your age of onset (26) is slightly later than typical for JME.Other Possibilities:Frontal Lobe Epilepsy: Can involve hypermotor activity (e.g., walking around) and often occurs during sleep or upon waking.Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES): If seizures are not responding to medication, PNES (caused by psychological factors) might be considered, though this is less likely given your description.Next Steps:See a Neurologist/Epileptologist:Request a thorough evaluation, including a detailed history, neurological exam, and possibly a video EEG to capture your seizures and identify their origin.Medication Adjustment:Since Keppra isn\u2019t effective, other anticonvulsants to consider (under medical supervision) include:LamotrigineLacosamideZonisamideBrivaracetam (similar to Keppra but potentially better tolerated)Valproate (though it has side effects, especially for women of childbearing age)Carbamazepine or Oxcarbazepine (if focal seizures are confirmed)Lifestyle Modifications:Maintain a regular sleep schedule (sleep deprivation is a common seizure trigger).Reduce stress through mindfulness, therapy, or relaxation techniques.Avoid alcohol and other potential triggers.Advanced Treatments:If medications fail, consider:Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)Epilepsy Surgery (if a specific brain focus is identified and safe to remove).Important:Your symptoms and seizure patterns need to be carefully evaluated by a specialist. Keep a detailed seizure diary (timing, triggers, symptoms) to help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Don\u2019t hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel your current treatment isn\u2019t addressing your needs.Take care, and I hope you find relief soon."

        "question": "25 Male, 186 CM, 93 KG.I was happy that Johnson vaccine finally arrived at my country. However I started reading about it, there were some concerns reported last month that it may cause Neurological disorder and muscle paralysis.So as a someone who is treating from mild epilepsy (occurred to me only 4 times and usually my diagnosis are good) for about 6 years , should I be concerned about it ? also if I have the chance to take AstraZeneca should I do it ?Would appreciate your response because I can't reach to my Dr. at the moment",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to have concerns about vaccines, especially given your medical history. Here\u2019s some information to help you make an informed decision:Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) Vaccine:Neurological Concerns: Reports of rare neurological side effects, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), have been associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. However, these cases are extremely rare (a few per million doses administered). GBS is a condition where the immune system attacks the nerves, potentially causing muscle weakness or paralysis, but most people recover fully.Epilepsy Considerations: There is no evidence that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine worsens epilepsy or increases seizure risk. However, if you have a history of neurological conditions, it\u2019s always wise to discuss with your doctor.AstraZeneca Vaccine:Safety Profile: AstraZeneca has also been associated with very rare blood clotting issues (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS) and, in extremely rare cases, neurological side effects like GBS. Again, these risks are very low.Epilepsy Considerations: Like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, there\u2019s no evidence that AstraZeneca exacerbates epilepsy or increases seizure risk.General Recommendations:Consult Your Doctor: Since you have epilepsy, it\u2019s best to consult your neurologist or treating physician before making a decision. They can provide personalized advice based on your medical history.Weigh the Risks and Benefits: Both vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19, which poses a much greater risk to your health than the rare side effects of the vaccines. COVID-19 itself can cause neurological complications, including seizures, in some individuals.Alternative Vaccines: If available, you might consider mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna, which have not been associated with the same rare neurological side effects as Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca.What You Can Do Now:Monitor official health guidelines from your country\u2019s health authority.Keep track of your epilepsy symptoms and ensure you\u2019re following your treatment plan.If you experience any unusual symptoms after vaccination, seek medical attention promptly.Since you can\u2019t reach your doctor at the moment, you might also consider contacting a local health hotline or consulting with a pharmacist for additional guidance."

        "question": "I am 14, Male I was diagnosed with Photosensitive Epilepsy at a young age if that helps.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I\u2019m sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of it and can take steps to manage it. Photosensitive epilepsy means that certain types of visual stimuli, like flashing lights or patterns, can trigger seizures. Here are some tips to help you stay safe and manage your condition:1. Avoid TriggersFlashing Lights: Be cautious around strobe lights, video games, or movies with rapid flashing scenes.Patterns: Avoid staring at repetitive patterns, like stripes or spirals, especially if they\u2019re high-contrast or moving.Screen Time: Reduce screen brightness, use anti-glare screens, and take regular breaks when using computers, phones, or TVs.2. Gaming and EntertainmentMany modern video games and apps have settings to reduce flashing effects or enable a \u201cphotosensitivity mode.\u201dCheck reviews or warnings for movies, TV shows, or games to see if they contain flashing content.Sit farther away from screens and watch in a well-lit room to reduce the impact of bright or flickering images.3. School and Daily LifeLet your teachers and friends know about your condition so they can help you avoid triggers.If you\u2019re in an environment where flashing lights might be present (e.g., school events, concerts), consider wearing polarized sunglasses or looking away from the source.4. Medical SupportStay in touch with your doctor or neurologist to monitor your condition and adjust treatment if needed.If you\u2019re prescribed medication, make sure to take it as directed.5. Emergency PlanLet people close to you know what to do if you have a seizure (e.g., keeping you safe, timing the seizure, and calling for help if needed).Consider wearing a medical ID bracelet that mentions your condition.6. Stay PositiveHaving photosensitive epilepsy doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy life. With some adjustments, you can still do most of the things you love.Talk to others with similar conditions (online or in support groups) to share tips and experiences.If you have specific concerns or questions about your condition, feel free to ask! You\u2019re not alone, and there are plenty of resources and people who can help you manage it."

        "question": "I\u2019m (19M) 6 foot 2, 74kg. I\u2019m on clobasam and tegratol for my epilepsy . Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don\u2019t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It\u2019s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit! All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great that you're seeking more information about this, as it's an important issue for your health. Let\u2019s break this down:1. Alcohol and EpilepsyAlcohol can lower the seizure threshold, meaning it can increase the risk of having a seizure, especially for people with epilepsy. This is true even for people who don\u2019t have epilepsy, but the risk is higher for those who do.Alcohol can also interfere with the effectiveness of your anti-epileptic medications (like clobazam and tegretol). These medications are metabolized by your liver, and alcohol can strain your liver, potentially reducing the medication's efficacy.Nocturnal epilepsy (seizures during sleep) can be particularly sensitive to disruptions in sleep patterns, and alcohol can disrupt sleep, even if you don\u2019t feel it. This could increase your risk of seizures.2. Your Doctor\u2019s AdviceYour doctor\u2019s recommendation of no more than 2 standard drinks is based on general guidelines for people with epilepsy. Alcohol affects everyone differently, but doctors err on the side of caution because the consequences of a seizure can be severe.The fact that you\u2019ve been fine so far doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re in the clear. Epilepsy can be unpredictable, and just because you haven\u2019t had a seizure triggered by alcohol yet doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen in the future.3. Are Some Epileptics Able to Drink More?Some people with epilepsy may tolerate alcohol better than others, but this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe. Even if you feel fine after drinking, you could still be increasing your risk of seizures or other complications.The problem is that there\u2019s no way to know for sure if you\u2019re one of those people who can tolerate more alcohol without putting yourself at risk. It\u2019s not worth gambling with your health to find out.4. The Risks of Drinking MoreSeizure Risk: Even if you haven\u2019t had a seizure triggered by alcohol yet, the risk is still there. Alcohol can cause dehydration, disrupt sleep, and lower your seizure threshold, all of which can contribute to a seizure.Medication Interference: Drinking heavily can reduce the effectiveness of your medications, making seizures more likely.Long-Term Health: Regular heavy drinking can have other long-term health consequences, including liver damage, which is especially concerning since your medications are processed by your liver.5. What You Should DoStick to Your Doctor\u2019s Advice: Your doctor\u2019s recommendation of no more than 2 standard drinks is there for a reason. It\u2019s based on your specific condition and the medications you\u2019re taking.Be Honest with Your Doctor: If you feel like your doctor hasn\u2019t fully explained the risks, bring it up at your next appointment. Ask them to explain why they recommend limiting alcohol and what the specific risks are for you.Consider Cutting Back: Even if you\u2019ve been fine so far, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Cutting back on alcohol could reduce your risk of seizures and other health issues.Monitor Your Triggers: If you notice that drinking more alcohol leads to more sleepwalking or other changes in your sleep patterns, this could be a sign that you\u2019re increasing your risk of seizures.6. Final ThoughtsYou may have been lucky so far, but luck isn\u2019t a reliable strategy when it comes to managing epilepsy. The risks of drinking more than recommended are real, and the consequences could be serious.It\u2019s frustrating not to have a clear answer, but the reality is that epilepsy is a complex condition, and alcohol affects everyone differently. The safest approach is to follow your doctor\u2019s advice and avoid pushing your limits.If you\u2019re struggling with the idea of cutting back on alcohol, consider talking to a counselor or support group. They can help you find ways to socialize and have fun without relying on alcohol. Your health is worth it!"

        "question": "21F. I pretty much have generalized hyperhidrosis but the sweating in my feet, hands, and underarms are what bother me the most. I\u2019ve been looking into Iontophoresis but read that people with epilepsy might not be able to use this treatment. Anyone know anything about this? Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Iontophoresis is a treatment that uses a mild electrical current to reduce sweating, typically in the hands, feet, and underarms. While it is generally considered safe, there are some contraindications, including for individuals with certain medical conditions such as epilepsy.The concern with using iontophoresis for someone with epilepsy is that the electrical current could potentially trigger a seizure, although this risk is considered low. However, because of the potential risk, it is generally advised that individuals with epilepsy avoid this treatment or consult closely with their healthcare provider before considering it.If you have epilepsy and are interested in iontophoresis for hyperhidrosis, it is crucial to discuss this with your neurologist or primary care physician. They can evaluate your specific situation, including the severity and control of your epilepsy, and determine whether the treatment is safe for you. They may also suggest alternative treatments for managing excessive sweating, such as topical antiperspirants, oral medications, or Botox injections.Always prioritize medical advice tailored to your individual health needs."

        "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your struggles with epilepsy, but it's great that you've been able to manage it effectively for the most part. To address your concerns:1. Does epilepsy increase the risk of brain-related diseases over time?Epilepsy itself does not directly cause other brain-related diseases, but there are some factors to consider:Seizure-related brain changes: Repeated seizures, especially if they are prolonged or severe, can potentially lead to changes in the brain over time. This is known as \"seizure-induced brain injury.\" However, this is more common in cases of frequent, uncontrolled seizures. Since your seizures are well-managed, this risk is likely lower for you.Cognitive and memory issues: Some people with epilepsy may experience mild cognitive difficulties or memory problems over time, particularly if seizures are not fully controlled. This doesn't necessarily mean a disease like dementia, but it can affect daily functioning.Comorbidities: People with epilepsy may have a slightly higher risk of developing certain conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or migraines, which can indirectly affect brain health.Medication effects: Long-term use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can sometimes have side effects on cognitive function or mood, but these are usually manageable with proper monitoring.2. Are seizures and partial seizures bad for the brain and should they be avoided at all costs?Seizures and brain health: Seizures, especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures (the \"full-blown\" type), can cause temporary stress on the brain. In rare cases, prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) can cause lasting damage. Partial seizures (focal seizures) are generally less severe but can still disrupt normal brain function and, if frequent, may contribute to cognitive or memory issues over time.Avoiding seizures: It's important to minimize seizures as much as possible, not just for brain health but also for safety and quality of life. Your approach of managing sleep, stress, and medication adherence is excellent. Even partial seizures should be avoided when possible, as they can still disrupt your daily life and potentially increase the risk of more severe seizures.3. What should you discuss with your doctor?Since your last appointment was rushed, here are some key points to prepare for your next visit:Long-term risks: Ask about any specific risks associated with your type of epilepsy and whether your treatment plan needs adjustments as you age.Memory and cognitive concerns: Discuss the memory loss you experienced after your last seizure and whether it warrants further investigation or changes in treatment.Medication review: Ensure your current medication regimen is still the best option for you, especially if you've been on the same drugs for many years.Lifestyle adjustments: Ask if there are additional steps you can take to further reduce the risk of seizures or long-term complications.Monitoring: Request regular check-ups or tests (e.g., EEG, MRI) to monitor your brain health over time.4. What can you do in the meantime?Stick to your management plan: Continue prioritizing sleep, medication adherence, and stress management.Keep a seizure diary: Track any partial seizures, triggers, or unusual symptoms to share with your doctor.Stay informed: Educate yourself about epilepsy and its long-term effects, but rely on reputable sources like epilepsy foundations or medical organizations.TL;DR:Epilepsy itself doesn't directly cause other brain diseases, but uncontrolled seizures can potentially lead to brain changes over time. Seizures and partial seizures should be avoided as much as possible to protect brain health and overall well-being. Discuss your long-term risks, memory concerns, and treatment plan with your doctor at your next appointment. In the meantime, continue managing your triggers and adhering to your treatment plan."

        "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about your symptoms, especially with the upcoming sleep-deprived EEG. What you're describing\u2014staring spells, spacing out, and feeling like you're not fully present\u2014could be related to a variety of factors, including absent seizures (a type of generalized seizure seen in epilepsy), but they could also be due to other causes like daydreaming, stress, fatigue, or even attention-related issues.Key Points to Consider:Absent Seizures (Petit Mal Seizures):These are brief episodes of staring or \"spacing out\" that typically last a few seconds (usually less than 15 seconds).During an absent seizure, the person is usually unresponsive and may not recall the episode afterward.Absent seizures are more common in children but can occur in adults, especially if there\u2019s a history of epilepsy or other neurological conditions.Daydreaming or Inattention:Many people experience moments of zoning out, especially when tired, stressed, or bored.Unlike seizures, these episodes are usually within your control, and you can often recall what was happening around you.Staring Spells:Staring spells can be normal, especially if they feel pleasant or relaxing (as you described). However, if they feel involuntary or you lose awareness, it could be a sign of a seizure.Epilepsy Diagnosis:Epilepsy can develop at any age, even in adulthood. While it\u2019s less common to be diagnosed after 31 without a history of seizures, it\u2019s not impossible.The sleep-deprived EEG is a good step, as it can help detect abnormal brain activity that might not show up during a regular EEG.What You Can Do While Waiting for the EEG:Keep a Symptom Diary: Note when these episodes occur, how long they last, and any triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights). This can help your doctor better understand your symptoms.Avoid Triggers: If flashing lights are a known issue, try to minimize exposure to them.Discuss with Your Doctor: Share your concerns and observations with your neurologist. They can help differentiate between normal inattention and potential seizure activity.How Common Is Epilepsy in Adults Without a History of Seizures?Epilepsy can develop later in life, but it\u2019s relatively rare to have no prior history of seizures or symptoms. However, some people may have had subtle symptoms (like staring spells) that went unnoticed or were mistaken for daydreaming.Final Thoughts:It\u2019s good that you\u2019re being proactive about your health. While your symptoms could be related to epilepsy, they might also be due to other factors. The EEG will provide more clarity, and in the meantime, try not to overthink it\u2014stress and anxiety can sometimes exacerbate symptoms. If the EEG is normal but your symptoms persist, your doctor may recommend further testing or evaluation.Good luck with your EEG, and I hope you get some answers soon!"

        "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you're doing a lot of things right with your diet and lifestyle, but your lab results indicate low folate and low ferritin (a marker of iron stores), which could explain some of your symptoms like fatigue, paleness, and even the thirst (though the thirst is less directly linked). Let\u2019s break this down and address your questions:1. Low Folate and Low Ferritin: Possible CausesWhile diet is a common cause of deficiencies, it\u2019s not the only one. Here are some possibilities:Dietary intake: Even though your diet sounds balanced, folate is found in foods like leafy greens, legumes, and fortified grains, and iron is found in meat, fish, and some plant sources. If your intake of these specific foods is inconsistent, it could contribute.Malabsorption: Conditions like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or even mild gut issues can impair the absorption of nutrients like folate and iron.Increased demand: If your body is using up these nutrients faster than usual (e.g., due to stress, illness, or growth), you might become deficient even with a decent diet.Medications: While Keppra (levetiracetam) isn\u2019t typically associated with folate or iron deficiency, some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can interfere with nutrient absorption or metabolism. It\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor if Keppra could play a role.Menstruation: Even though your periods are light, they could still contribute to iron loss over time, especially if your dietary iron intake isn\u2019t sufficient to compensate.2. Connection Between Folate and Iron DeficiencyFolate and iron deficiencies can sometimes occur together because:Both are needed for red blood cell production. Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, while iron is needed for hemoglobin. A deficiency in one can exacerbate the other.Poor diet or malabsorption issues can affect multiple nutrients simultaneously.Chronic fatigue and low energy from one deficiency can lead to reduced dietary intake, worsening the other.3. Could This Affect Your Epilepsy?Folate deficiency: Low folate levels have been linked to increased seizure risk in some people, though the evidence isn\u2019t conclusive. Folate is important for brain function, and correcting a deficiency might help stabilize your nervous system.Iron deficiency: While iron deficiency itself doesn\u2019t directly cause seizures, severe anemia can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, which might indirectly affect seizure control.Medication interactions: As mentioned, Keppra isn\u2019t typically associated with these deficiencies, but it\u2019s worth discussing with your neurologist to rule out any indirect effects.4. What to Ask Your DoctorDuring your appointment, consider asking:Could my diet still be a factor, even though I think it\u2019s balanced?Should I be tested for malabsorption issues (e.g., celiac disease, IBD)?Could my Keppra or epilepsy be contributing to these deficiencies?Should I start supplements for folate and iron, and if so, what type and dosage?Should I involve my neurologist in this, or could these deficiencies affect my seizure control?5. Next StepsFolate supplementation: Your doctor will likely recommend folate supplements (e.g., folic acid or methylfolate) to correct the deficiency.Iron supplementation: For low ferritin, they may suggest iron supplements. Since iron can be hard on the stomach, ask about the best form (e.g., ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate) and whether you should take it with vitamin C to enhance absorption.Diet adjustments: While your diet sounds good, you might need to focus on iron-rich foods (e.g., red meat, spinach, lentils) and folate-rich foods (e.g., leafy greens, fortified cereals, beans).Follow-up tests: Your doctor may want to retest your levels after a few months of supplementation to ensure they\u2019re improving.6. When to Contact Your NeurologistIt\u2019s a good idea to inform your neurologist about these deficiencies, especially since folate plays a role in brain health. They might want to monitor your seizure control more closely or adjust your treatment plan if needed.SummaryYour symptoms (fatigue, paleness, thirst) could be related to low folate and low ferritin. While your diet seems balanced, other factors like absorption issues or increased nutrient demands might be at play. These deficiencies could indirectly affect your epilepsy, so it\u2019s worth discussing with both your GP and neurologist. In the meantime, your doctor will likely recommend supplements and possibly further testing to rule out underlying causes.Let me know if you have more questions!"

        "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your son's seizure, but I'm glad you're taking steps to understand his condition and treatment options. Here are some answers to your questions based on medical knowledge and clinical experience:1. Abnormal EEG hours after the event:An abnormal EEG after a seizure is not uncommon. Seizures can cause temporary or lasting changes in brain activity, which may show up on an EEG even hours after the event. In some cases, individuals with epilepsy have an abnormal EEG even when they are not actively seizing. This is because epilepsy is a condition of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can persist between seizures.It doesn't necessarily mean your son always has an abnormal EEG, but it suggests his brain may be predisposed to seizures.2. Could the abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?The abnormal EEG itself does not directly cause growth or developmental issues. However, if the abnormal electrical activity is frequent or severe (e.g., in untreated epilepsy), it could potentially impact cognitive function or development over time. This is why controlling seizures with medication is important.Your son\u2019s growth and development so far seem normal, which is a good sign. Regular follow-ups with his neurologist will help monitor any changes.3. Should you worry about an underlying cause? Is an MRI needed?The CT scan ruled out major structural issues like tumors or large lesions, which is reassuring. However, an MRI can detect smaller abnormalities, such as subtle scarring (e.g., from a past injury or infection) or malformations in the brain that a CT scan might miss.While the EEG findings and clinical presentation suggest primary generalized epilepsy (a genetic or idiopathic form), an MRI can provide additional information. If you\u2019re concerned, you can discuss this with the neurologist. Some doctors prefer to wait unless there are specific red flags (e.g., focal seizures, abnormal neurological exam).4. Quality of life on Depakote:Depakote (valproate) is a commonly used medication for generalized epilepsy, especially in children. It\u2019s effective for many patients, but like all medications, it has potential side effects:Behavioral changes: Some children may experience mood swings, irritability, or drowsiness, especially when starting the medication. However, others tolerate it well.Weight gain: This is a common side effect, so monitoring diet and activity is important.Hair loss: This is possible but usually reversible.Liver toxicity: Rare but serious. Liver function tests are typically monitored regularly.Other risks: Depakote can affect platelet function and, in rare cases, cause pancreatitis.Many children do well on Depakote with minimal side effects. Regular monitoring by the neurologist can help catch and manage any issues early.5. Avoiding Depakote and using CBD instead:While CBD (cannabidiol) has shown promise in treating certain types of epilepsy (e.g., Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), it is not a first-line treatment for primary generalized epilepsy. It is typically used as an add-on therapy when traditional medications fail.Depakote is a well-established treatment for generalized epilepsy, and avoiding it without a clear alternative could increase the risk of further seizures, which can be harmful.If you\u2019re concerned about Depakote, discuss alternative medications (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine) with the neurologist. These may have different side effect profiles.6. Second or third opinion:It\u2019s always reasonable to seek a second opinion, especially if you have lingering doubts or concerns. Epilepsy diagnosis and treatment can be complex, and another neurologist may offer additional insights.You can share the existing EEG results with another neurologist to avoid repeating the test unnecessarily. However, if the second neurologist recommends a repeat EEG or MRI, it may be worth considering.7. Practical next steps:Follow-up EEG: The planned video EEG is a good idea. It can provide more detailed information about your son\u2019s brain activity and help confirm the diagnosis.Monitoring: Keep a seizure diary to track any further episodes, triggers, or side effects from the medication.Lifestyle: Ensure your son gets enough sleep, stays hydrated, and avoids known seizure triggers (e.g., flashing lights, if he\u2019s photosensitive).Support: Connect with support groups for parents of children with epilepsy. They can provide practical advice and emotional support.Final Thoughts:It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you\u2019re doing the right thing by seeking information and advocating for your son. Primary generalized epilepsy is often manageable with medication, and many children with epilepsy go on to live full, healthy lives. Work closely with the neurologist, ask questions, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek additional opinions if needed."

        "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but based on your description, it does sound like you may have experienced a seizure or a seizure-like episode. Here are some key points that align with seizure activity:Aura/Deja Vu Feeling: The \"deja vu\" sensation you described is a common aura that can precede a seizure, particularly in focal (partial) seizures. Auras are often a warning sign of an impending seizure.Inability to Move, Speak, or Open Eyes: The episode where you couldn\u2019t move, speak, or open your eyes for 20 seconds, combined with amplified sound and a vibrating sensation, could be consistent with a focal impaired awareness seizure (previously called a complex partial seizure). These seizures can involve altered consciousness and unusual sensory experiences.Post-Ictal State: After the episode, you felt exhausted and groggy, which is typical of a post-ictal state\u2014the recovery period after a seizure. This can last minutes to hours and often involves fatigue, confusion, and sometimes emotional changes.History of Epilepsy: Your history of seizures as a child, even though they were previously controlled, increases your risk of having another seizure later in life, especially if there are triggers like sleep deprivation, stress, or alcohol use.Potential Triggers in Your Case:Sleep Deprivation: You mentioned being awake for a long time and only sleeping a few hours. Lack of sleep is a common seizure trigger.Alcohol Use: Drinking during or after your shift could lower your seizure threshold, especially if combined with other factors like fatigue or stress.Stimulants: Adderall and caffeine (espresso) can increase nervous system excitability, which might contribute to seizure activity in susceptible individuals.Stress/Anxiety: Chronic anxiety and the stress of a new job could also play a role.What You Should Do:Consult a Neurologist: It\u2019s important to see a neurologist as soon as possible to evaluate this episode. They may recommend an EEG or other tests to assess your brain activity and determine if this was a seizure.Review Medications: Let your neurologist and prescribing doctor know about this episode. They may need to adjust your medications, especially since Adderall and Buspar can affect seizure risk.Avoid Triggers: Until you see a doctor, try to avoid potential triggers like alcohol, excessive caffeine, and sleep deprivation.Monitor Symptoms: Keep a detailed log of any similar episodes, including timing, symptoms, and potential triggers. This will help your doctor make a diagnosis.Safety Precautions: If you have another episode, avoid situations where a seizure could be dangerous (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery) until you\u2019ve been cleared by a doctor.This episode could be related to your history of epilepsy, but it\u2019s important to get a proper evaluation to rule out other causes and ensure you\u2019re on the right treatment plan. Don\u2019t delay seeking medical attention."

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about your accident and the ongoing pain you're experiencing. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's great that the Topiramate has been helping with your seizures. However, the pain in your left side and lower rib cage area is concerning, especially given the context of your car accident. Here are some thoughts and suggestions that might help you better understand your situation:Possible Causes of Your Pain:Rib Fracture or Bruising: Even at lower speeds, the force of a car accident can cause rib fractures or bruising. Rib injuries can be very painful and may not always show visible signs like swelling or redness. The pain can be sharp and worsen with movement, breathing, or coughing.Costochondritis: This is inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your sternum. It can cause sharp, localized pain and may be triggered by trauma, such as the impact from a seatbelt or airbag.Pleurisy: This is inflammation of the lining around the lungs (pleura). It can cause sharp chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing. Pleurisy can be caused by trauma, infections, or other underlying conditions.Internal Organ Injury: Although less common, trauma from a car accident could potentially cause injury to internal organs like the spleen, liver, or lungs. Symptoms might include pain, tenderness, or referred pain in the shoulder or back.Muscle Strain: The impact of the accident could have caused strain or tearing of the muscles in your chest or abdominal wall, leading to persistent pain.What You Can Do:Monitor Your Symptoms: Keep track of your pain levels, any changes in the pain (e.g., sharp vs. dull, constant vs. intermittent), and any additional symptoms like shortness of breath, fever, or coughing up blood. These could indicate a more serious issue.Rest and Avoid Strain: Avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, such as heavy lifting or strenuous exercise. Give your body time to heal.Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: If you're not already taking them, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) might help manage the pain. Be cautious with NSAIDs if you have any stomach issues or other contraindications.Breathing Exercises: If the pain is affecting your breathing, try gentle breathing exercises to prevent complications like pneumonia. Deep breathing can also help reduce anxiety related to the pain.Follow Up with a Doctor: While you mentioned financial constraints, it\u2019s important to prioritize seeing a doctor when possible. Rib injuries and internal issues can sometimes lead to complications if not properly addressed. If your pain worsens, or if you develop new symptoms like difficulty breathing, dizziness, or severe fatigue, seek medical attention immediately.When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention:Severe Pain: If the pain becomes unbearable or significantly worse.Difficulty Breathing: If you experience shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or feel like you can't get enough air.Coughing Up Blood: This could indicate a lung injury.Fever or Chills: These could be signs of an infection or other complications.Signs of Internal Bleeding: Such as dizziness, fainting, or a rapid heart rate.Long-Term Considerations:Neurologist Visit: Once you\u2019re able to, seeing a neurologist is crucial for managing your seizures and ensuring you\u2019re on the right treatment plan. They can also help confirm the diagnosis of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and adjust your medication if needed.Driving Restrictions: Depending on your location and the severity of your seizures, there may be legal restrictions on driving until your seizures are well-controlled. This is an important safety consideration for both you and others on the road.Final Thoughts:Your health and safety are the most important things right now. While it\u2019s understandable that financial constraints are a barrier, please try to prioritize getting medical attention as soon as you can. In the meantime, take care of yourself, monitor your symptoms closely, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek emergency care if things worsen. Wishing you a speedy recovery and better days ahead."

        "answer": "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this\u2014it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with a lot, and it\u2019s completely understandable to feel scared and frustrated. Deciding whether to pursue brain surgery or additional testing is a big decision, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re thinking carefully about it. Here\u2019s some information to help you weigh your options:Why Your Doctor Recommended TestingThe tests your doctor suggested\u2014PET scan, CT scan, and MRI\u2014are critical for evaluating whether surgery might be an option for you. Here\u2019s what they can help determine:MRI: Provides detailed images of your brain to identify any structural abnormalities (like scars, lesions, or malformations) that could be causing your seizures.PET Scan: Measures brain activity and can show areas of the brain that are functioning abnormally, even if they look normal on an MRI.CT Scan: Can help rule out other causes of seizures, like tumors or bleeding, though it\u2019s less detailed than an MRI.These tests, combined with EEG monitoring, can help pinpoint the exact area of your brain where seizures start. If the seizures consistently originate from one area that can be safely removed, surgery might be a viable option.Risks and Benefits of SurgeryPotential Benefits:Seizure Freedom: If the surgery is successful, it could significantly reduce or even eliminate your seizures.Improved Quality of Life: Without the constant fear of seizures, you might feel more confident and independent.Reduced Medication Dependence: If seizures are controlled, you might be able to reduce or stop some of your medications.Potential Risks:Surgical Risks: All surgeries carry risks, such as infection, bleeding, or complications from anesthesia.Neurological Effects: Depending on the area of the brain involved, there could be changes in personality, memory, or motor skills.No Guarantee: Surgery doesn\u2019t work for everyone, and there\u2019s a chance seizures could continue or new symptoms could arise.SUDEP ConcernsSUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is a rare but serious risk for people with epilepsy, especially those with uncontrolled seizures. While it\u2019s natural to be terrified of SUDEP, the risk is generally higher in people with frequent, uncontrolled seizures. If surgery could reduce or eliminate your seizures, it might actually lower your risk of SUDEP in the long term.Medication vs. SurgeryMedications can work well for many people, but they don\u2019t work for everyone. If your seizures aren\u2019t well-controlled despite multiple medications, surgery might be worth considering. However, surgery is typically only recommended if:The seizures originate from a single, identifiable area of the brain.That area can be removed without causing significant harm to brain function.What to ConsiderYour Goals: You mentioned wanting to be free of seizures and the fear they cause. If medications aren\u2019t giving you the control you need, surgery might be a way to achieve that.Your Support System: Having family or friends to support you through the testing and recovery process is important.Your Doctor\u2019s Expertise: Trust your medical team, but don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions. You have the right to understand all your options and the risks and benefits of each.Next StepsAsk Questions: Talk to your doctor about the likelihood of success, the risks of surgery, and what recovery would look like.Seek a Second Opinion: If you\u2019re unsure, consider consulting with another neurologist or epilepsy specialist.Take Your Time: This is a big decision, and it\u2019s okay to take time to think it over.Final ThoughtsIt\u2019s clear that you\u2019re strong and determined to improve your life. If the tests could lead to a treatment that gives you more control over your seizures, they might be worth considering despite the fear. At the same time, it\u2019s okay to feel hesitant\u2014this is a big step. Whatever you decide, make sure it\u2019s the right choice for you.If you\u2019d like, I can help you brainstorm questions to ask your doctor or provide more information about the tests or surgery.

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your recent health challenges, but I'm glad you're taking a proactive approach to your care. Here\u2019s some information and questions you can bring up with your doctor regarding your symptoms, treatment options, and potential deep brain stimulation (DBS):Key Points to Discuss with Your DoctorDystonia and Epilepsy Connection:Ask if your recent dystonia episode could be related to your temporal lobe epilepsy or if it might be a separate condition.Inquire whether the dystonia could be a side effect of your medications (e.g., Keppra or Prozac) or a symptom of poorly controlled epilepsy.Medication Review:Since Keppra doesn\u2019t seem to be effective, ask about alternative anti-seizure medications (e.g., lamotrigine, lacosamide, or brivaracetam) that might better control your epilepsy.Discuss whether Prozac could be contributing to your symptoms, as some SSRIs can lower the seizure threshold or cause movement disorders in rare cases.Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):Ask if you\u2019re a candidate for DBS, which is sometimes used for treatment-resistant epilepsy and certain types of dystonia.Inquire about the risks, benefits, and success rates of DBS for your specific conditions.Discuss the evaluation process for DBS, which may include neuropsychological testing, imaging, and monitoring.Other Treatment Options:Ask about vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which are less invasive than DBS and approved for epilepsy.Inquire about physical therapy or botulinum toxin (Botox) injections for dystonia management.Discuss whether lifestyle changes (e.g., stress management, sleep hygiene, or dietary adjustments like the ketogenic diet) could help.Diagnostic Workup:Request further testing to rule out other causes of dystonia, such as metabolic disorders, genetic conditions, or structural brain abnormalities.Ask if additional EEG or MRI studies are needed to better understand your epilepsy and dystonia.Long-Term Management:Discuss a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses both your epilepsy and dystonia.Inquire about seeing a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders or epilepsy for a second opinion.Questions to Ask About Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):Am I a good candidate for DBS based on my medical history and symptoms?What are the potential risks and benefits of DBS for my conditions?What is the success rate of DBS for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and dystonia?What does the evaluation process involve, and how long does it take?What are the alternatives to DBS, and how do they compare in terms of effectiveness and risks?What kind of follow-up and adjustments are required after DBS surgery?Other Recommendations:Keep a Symptom Diary:Track your seizures, dystonia episodes, medication use, and any triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep). This can help your doctor identify patterns and adjust your treatment.Seek a Specialist:Consider seeing a neurologist who specializes in both epilepsy and movement disorders, as they may have more experience with complex cases like yours.Explore Support Groups:Connecting with others who have epilepsy or dystonia can provide emotional support and practical advice. Organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation or the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation may have resources.Stay Informed but Cautious:While researching is great, ensure you\u2019re using reputable sources (e.g., medical journals, trusted organizations) and discuss any findings with your doctor before making decisions.Next Steps:Bring your symptom diary and a list of your current medications to your appointment.Write down your questions in advance so you don\u2019t forget anything during the visit.Consider bringing a trusted friend or family member to help take notes and provide support.I hope this helps you prepare for your appointment.

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your girlfriend\u2019s case is complex and involves several critical aspects of neurology, including status epilepticus, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and potential autoimmune or inflammatory processes. Below, I\u2019ll address your questions and provide some insights based on the information you\u2019ve shared:1. Was her head-to-head movement seizure activity?The side-to-side head movements you described when she was found unresponsive could indeed be seizure activity, particularly if they were rhythmic and involuntary. This type of movement can be seen in focal seizures with impaired awareness (previously called complex partial seizures), especially if they originate from the temporal lobe. In her case, the abnormal EEG pointing to the left temporal lobe supports this possibility.The fact that she was unresponsive during these movements further suggests that this was likely ictal (seizure) activity rather than a post-ictal phenomenon or another cause of altered consciousness.2. Was she in status epilepticus?Yes, it sounds like she was in status epilepticus during her initial presentation. Status epilepticus is defined as a prolonged seizure (typically >5 minutes for tonic-clonic seizures) or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness in between. Her 8.5-minute tonic-clonic seizure and the need for an induced coma, along with the use of medications like midazolam (a benzodiazepine often used for acute seizure control), strongly support this diagnosis.Status epilepticus is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The fact that she required ICU admission and multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) highlights the severity of her condition.3. What are your thoughts on what she had?Initial Presentation: Her high fever, prolonged seizures, and unresponsiveness suggest an acute neurological insult. The differential diagnosis at the time likely included:Infectious encephalitis (e.g., viral or bacterial): Fever and seizures are common in encephalitis, though her spinal taps did not support this.Autoimmune encephalitis: This was considered given the use of prednisone and IVIG. While her spinal tap did not confirm this, autoimmune encephalitis can sometimes be seronegative (no antibodies detected). The improvement with immunotherapy (prednisone and IVIG) could suggest an autoimmune component.Febrile status epilepticus: Prolonged seizures triggered by fever, though this is more common in children.New-onset epilepsy: It\u2019s possible that the fever triggered her first seizure in the context of an underlying predisposition to epilepsy.Current Diagnosis: Her ongoing seizures, EEG findings, and clinical features strongly suggest temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE is often associated with focal seizures that can secondarily generalize (as seen in her initial tonic-clonic seizures). Her current seizures (conscious but with head, mouth, and eye movements) are consistent with focal aware or impaired awareness seizures originating from the temporal lobe.4. What are your thoughts on the current medication?Her current AED regimen includes:Phenytoin (300 mg): A first-line AED for focal and tonic-clonic seizures. It\u2019s effective but has side effects (e.g., gingival hyperplasia, osteoporosis) and requires monitoring of blood levels.Levetiracetam (2500 mg): A broad-spectrum AED with fewer drug interactions. It\u2019s commonly used for focal and generalized seizures but can cause mood changes or irritability in some patients.Sodium valproate (2400 mg): Another broad-spectrum AED, effective for focal and generalized seizures. It\u2019s particularly useful in TLE but has significant side effects (e.g., weight gain, tremor, teratogenicity).Vimpat (lacosamide): This is a newer AED that can be effective for focal seizures. It\u2019s often used as an add-on therapy when seizures are not fully controlled. It\u2019s generally well-tolerated but can cause dizziness or cardiac rhythm changes.Assessment of Current Regimen:She is on three AEDs at relatively high doses, yet she continues to have seizures (~2x per week). This suggests that her epilepsy is drug-resistant (refractory). The addition of Vimpat may help, but it\u2019s important to monitor for side effects and interactions.Given her refractory epilepsy, you may want to discuss other treatment options with her neurologist, such as:Epilepsy surgery: If her seizures consistently originate from the left temporal lobe, resective surgery could be curative. A thorough pre-surgical evaluation (e.g., video-EEG monitoring, neuropsychological testing, and advanced imaging) would be needed.Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): A device implanted in the chest that can reduce seizure frequency.Ketogenic diet: A high-fat, low-carb diet that can be effective in refractory epilepsy.Further immunotherapy: If an autoimmune component is still suspected, additional immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab) could be considered.5. Additional Considerations:Memory Issues: Her memory problems are likely related to her TLE. The temporal lobe is critical for memory formation, and seizures in this region can cause both ictal and interictal memory dysfunction.Nocturnal Seizures: Seizures during sleep are common in TLE. Ensuring good sleep hygiene and discussing nocturnal seizure control with her neurologist is important.Video Recordings: The videos of her seizures are valuable for her neurologist to review. They can help confirm the seizure type and guide treatment adjustments.Summary:Her initial presentation was likely status epilepticus triggered by fever, with a possible autoimmune or inflammatory component.Her current diagnosis is temporal lobe epilepsy, with ongoing focal seizures despite high-dose AEDs.Her current medications are appropriate but may need adjustment or augmentation (e.g., adding Vimpat). Consider discussing advanced treatment options (e.g., surgery, VNS) with her neurologist.Her memory issues and nocturnal seizures are consistent with TLE and should be addressed as part of her overall management.I strongly recommend continuing to work closely with her neurologist, ideally one specializing in epilepsy, to optimize her treatment and explore all available options."

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your experiences, but I'm glad you're taking steps to understand what's happening. It's important to address this thoughtfully, as seizures can have significant implications for your health and safety. Here's some guidance to help you navigate this situation:1. Could It Be Epilepsy?Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. While you've had two seizures, they were triggered by specific physical sensations (being hit by a baseball and ear piercing). These might be considered reflex seizures, which are triggered by specific stimuli, rather than unprovoked seizures typical of epilepsy.However, only a healthcare professional can determine whether your seizures are part of epilepsy or another condition. The fact that you experienced an aura, ictal, and post-ictal phases suggests these were indeed seizures, but the underlying cause needs to be investigated.2. Should You Get Tested?Yes, you should see a doctor. Even though your seizures were years apart, they were significant events that could indicate an underlying neurological issue. A neurologist can evaluate your history, perform tests, and determine whether further monitoring or treatment is needed.Diagnostic steps may include:EEG (Electroencephalogram): To check for abnormal brain activity.MRI or CT scan: To rule out structural issues in the brain.Blood tests: To check for metabolic or other systemic causes.Even if you don't have epilepsy, understanding why these seizures occurred is important for your safety and peace of mind.3. Implications of a DiagnosisIf you are diagnosed with epilepsy or another seizure disorder:Treatment: Medications (anti-seizure drugs) are often effective in preventing future seizures.Lifestyle adjustments: You may need to avoid known triggers, ensure adequate sleep, and manage stress.Driving restrictions: Many places have laws about driving after a seizure, so this could impact your ability to drive until you're seizure-free for a certain period.Safety precautions: You may need to take steps to avoid injury during a seizure, such as avoiding heights or swimming alone.If no underlying condition is found, you may still benefit from understanding your triggers and how to avoid them.4. Are You Making a Big Deal Out of Nothing?No, you're not. Seizures are a serious medical issue, and understanding their cause is crucial. Even if they are infrequent, they can pose risks, especially if they occur unexpectedly (e.g., while driving or swimming). Taking this seriously is the right thing to do.5. Next StepsSchedule an appointment with your primary care doctor or a neurologist. Bring detailed notes about your seizures, including:What happened before, during, and after each episode.Any triggers or patterns you've noticed.How long the episodes lasted and how you felt afterward.Avoid known triggers until you have more information.Educate yourself further about seizures and epilepsy, but rely on reputable sources like the Epilepsy Foundation or medical professionals.6. Emotional and Spiritual AspectsIt's not uncommon for people who experience seizures to describe profound emotional or spiritual experiences, especially during the aura or post-ictal phase. These feelings are valid and can be part of the neurological process. If these experiences are meaningful to you, consider discussing them with a counselor or therapist who understands the intersection of health and spirituality.Final ThoughtsYou're not overreacting\u2014this is a legitimate health concern that deserves attention. Even if your seizures are infrequent, understanding their cause and how to manage them is important for your long-term well-being. Take the step to see a doctor, and don't hesitate to advocate for yourself if you feel your concerns aren't being taken seriously. You're doing the right thing by seeking answers!"

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",

        "answer": "Hello! It's great that you're doing thorough research before starting HRT, especially given your medical history with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and your current medication regimen. Let\u2019s break this down step by step to address your concerns about potential interactions between HRT and your epilepsy medications (Depakote and Keppra).1. HRT and Epilepsy: General ConsiderationsHormonal changes, particularly fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, can influence seizure thresholds in individuals with epilepsy. Estrogen is generally considered pro-convulsant (lowers seizure threshold), while progesterone has anti-convulsant properties (raises seizure threshold).For transgender women (male-to-female), HRT typically involves estrogen therapy, often combined with anti-androgens (e.g., spironolactone) or other androgen blockers. These hormonal changes could theoretically affect seizure control, though the extent varies between individuals.2. Depakote (Valproate) and HRTDepakote is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) that is also used as a mood stabilizer. It is metabolized in the liver and has several interactions to consider:Estrogen Interaction: Estrogen can increase the metabolism of valproate via induction of hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP450), potentially reducing its serum levels and efficacy. This could theoretically lead to breakthrough seizures.Monitoring: If you start HRT, your neurologist may need to monitor your valproate levels more closely and adjust the dose if necessary.Anti-Androgen Interaction: Spironolactone, a common anti-androgen used in MTF HRT, is generally safe with valproate, but it\u2019s important to monitor for side effects like electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia).3. Keppra (Levetiracetam) and HRTKeppra is another broad-spectrum AED with a relatively low risk of drug interactions. It is primarily renally excreted and does not undergo significant hepatic metabolism.Estrogen Interaction: Keppra is unlikely to interact directly with estrogen or other HRT components. However, hormonal changes could still indirectly affect seizure control.Monitoring: Keppra levels are not typically monitored, but you should remain vigilant for any changes in seizure frequency or side effects.4. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and HRTJME is a lifelong condition that is often well-controlled with medications like valproate and levetiracetam. However, it is sensitive to hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, and stress.Sleep and Anxiety: Since sleep and anxiety are your primary triggers, it\u2019s important to ensure that HRT does not exacerbate these factors. For example, estrogen can sometimes affect mood and sleep patterns, so close monitoring is key.5. Practical RecommendationsConsult Your Neurologist and Endocrinologist: While it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re hesitant to bring this up, it\u2019s crucial to involve your neurologist and an endocrinologist experienced in transgender care. They can work together to:Monitor your AED levels (especially valproate) during HRT initiation.Adjust your medication doses if necessary.Address any changes in seizure frequency or side effects.Baseline Labs: Before starting HRT, consider getting baseline labs for valproate levels, liver function, and hormone levels.Gradual HRT Initiation: Starting HRT at a low dose and titrating up slowly may help minimize the risk of seizure exacerbation.Seizure Diary: Keep a detailed seizure diary to track any changes in frequency, type, or triggers after starting HRT.6. Specific HRT MedicationsEstrogen Options: Common forms include oral estradiol, transdermal patches, or injections. Transdermal patches may have a more stable hormonal profile and lower risk of hepatic enzyme induction compared to oral estrogen.Anti-Androgens: Spironolactone is commonly used and generally safe with your current medications. Alternatives like bicalutamide or GnRH agonists may also be considered, depending on your overall health.7. Other ConsiderationsBone Health: Valproate and estrogen both have implications for bone health. Ensure adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise to mitigate any risks.Mental Health: HRT can have significant psychological effects. If anxiety worsens, it could indirectly increase seizure risk. Consider working with a therapist experienced in transgender care.SummaryDepakote: Monitor levels closely, as estrogen may reduce its efficacy.Keppra: Unlikely to interact directly with HRT, but remain vigilant for changes in seizure control.HRT: Start low and go slow, with close monitoring by both your neurologist and endocrinologist.Communication: While it\u2019s great to educate yourself, discussing this with your healthcare team is essential for safe and effective care.If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask! Good luck with your transition and your studies in neurology!"

        "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\\\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \\\"seizures\\\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about your mom's health struggles and the stress this is causing you and your family. It sounds like you're dealing with a very complex and challenging situation. While I can't provide a diagnosis, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help you and your family navigate this situation and prepare for discussions with her doctors.Possible Causes and Considerations:Medication Side Effects:Gabapentin and Depakote (valproate) are both medications that can cause cognitive side effects, including confusion, memory issues, and drowsiness. While your doctor may not attribute her symptoms to these medications, it\u2019s worth noting that polypharmacy (using multiple medications) can increase the risk of adverse effects, especially in older adults.Gabapentin is known to cause dizziness, unsteadiness, and cognitive impairment in some people, particularly at higher doses or when combined with other central nervous system depressants.Depakote can also cause tremors, confusion, and memory problems, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing cognitive issues.Epilepsy or Seizure-like Activity:The episodes you describe (legs shaking, falls, and tremors) could be related to her epilepsy diagnosis. However, it\u2019s also possible that other conditions, such as non-epileptic seizures (psychogenic or related to stress/anxiety), could be contributing. These can sometimes mimic epileptic seizures but have different underlying causes.The fact that she didn\u2019t have any episodes in the hospital could suggest that environmental or psychological factors (e.g., stress, familiarity with surroundings) play a role.Cognitive Decline:The memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with basic tasks (e.g., spelling, math) could be related to early-onset dementia (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disease) or another form of cognitive impairment. The presence of plaque on the brain (if confirmed by imaging) could support this possibility.However, cognitive decline can also be caused or exacerbated by medications, chronic illness, or untreated conditions like vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12 deficiency) or thyroid dysfunction.Other Potential Causes:Orthostatic Hypotension: A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing could cause falls or near-falls. This is common in older adults, especially those on blood pressure medications.Parkinson\u2019s Disease or Parkinsonian Symptoms: Tremors, jerks, and balance issues could be related to a movement disorder. Some medications (e.g., antipsychotics, anti-nausea drugs) can cause Parkinsonian symptoms as a side effect.Chronic Smoking-Related Issues: Long-term smoking can lead to vascular problems, which might contribute to cognitive decline or other neurological symptoms.Anxiety or Psychogenic Factors: Severe anxiety or stress can manifest physically, including tremors, jerks, or even seizure-like episodes.Questions and Tests to Discuss with Her Doctor:Medication Review:Ask for a thorough review of all her medications, including potential interactions and side effects. Consider asking if gabapentin or Depakote could be contributing to her cognitive decline or tremors.Inquire about alternative medications or adjustments to her current regimen.Cognitive Assessment:Request a formal cognitive evaluation to assess for dementia or other cognitive impairments. This might include tests like the MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) or MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).Ask if imaging (e.g., MRI or CT scan) has been done recently to assess the extent of plaque or other brain changes.Seizure Evaluation:If her episodes are still occurring despite treatment, ask if further testing (e.g., EEG monitoring) could help clarify whether they are truly epileptic seizures or something else.Blood Tests:Request blood tests to rule out reversible causes of cognitive decline, such as:Vitamin B12 deficiencyThyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism)Electrolyte imbalancesLiver or kidney dysfunctionOrthostatic Blood Pressure Check:Ask her doctor to check her blood pressure while lying down, sitting, and standing to rule out orthostatic hypotension.Psychiatric Evaluation:If anxiety or stress is suspected to play a role in her episodes, consider asking for a referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist.Practical Steps to Take:Keep a Detailed Journal:Document her symptoms, including the frequency and duration of her episodes, any triggers, and her cognitive and behavioral changes. This can help her doctors better understand what\u2019s happening.Medication Management:Ensure she\u2019s taking her medications exactly as prescribed. Consider using a pill organizer or setting reminders to avoid missed doses or accidental double-dosing.Safety Measures:Make her environment as safe as possible to prevent falls (e.g., remove tripping hazards, install grab bars, use a medical alert system).Support for Caregivers:Caring for a loved one with complex health issues can be overwhelming. Consider seeking support through caregiver support groups or counseling to help manage your anxiety and stress.Advocate for Her Care:If you feel her concerns aren\u2019t being addressed, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist or specialist.Final Thoughts:It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your mom and are doing everything you can to help her. While her situation is complex, advocating for thorough testing and exploring all possible causes can help ensure she gets the best care possible. Don\u2019t hesitate to push for answers or seek additional opinions if you feel her current treatment plan isn\u2019t addressing her needs.Take care of yourself, too\u2014your well-being is just as important as hers. Wishing you and your family strength and clarity as you navigate this difficult time."

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\\\"generalized\\\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \\\"accidents\\\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \\\"present\\\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like your daughter has made significant progress since discontinuing valproic acid, which is wonderful to hear. Valproic acid (VPA) is indeed a medication with a broad range of effects, and its impact on your daughter's behavior and development could be multifaceted. Here are some possible explanations for the changes you've observed:1. Cognitive and Behavioral Effects of Valproic AcidSedation and Cognitive Blunting: Valproic acid can have sedative effects, which may have contributed to your daughter appearing less \"present\" or aware of her surroundings. By discontinuing the medication, these sedative effects may have lifted, allowing her to engage more fully with her environment.Mood Stabilization: As you mentioned, valproic acid is used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder. While your daughter does not have a bipolar diagnosis, the medication may have had a dampening effect on her emotional responsiveness. Without it, her emotions may be more pronounced, which could explain the occasional mood swings (sadness and crying) but also her increased engagement and awareness.2. Neurodevelopmental ImpactDevelopmental Delays and Medication Effects: Children with neurodevelopmental conditions like PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder) and ADHD can be particularly sensitive to medications that affect the central nervous system. Valproic acid may have subtly influenced her cognitive and social development, and discontinuing it could have allowed her natural developmental trajectory to emerge more clearly.Improved Communication and Social Skills: The lifting of sedative effects and increased alertness may have made it easier for her to process language, follow directions, and engage socially. This could explain the strides she has made in communication and social interaction.3. Seizure Control and Brain FunctionSeizure Freedom and Brain Development: Being seizure-free for over two years is a significant milestone. Seizures, even subclinical ones, can interfere with brain development and function. With her seizures well-controlled and now off medication, her brain may be functioning more optimally, allowing for improved cognitive and social skills.Neuroplasticity: The brain, especially in children, has a remarkable ability to rewire and adapt. Being off valproic acid may have allowed her brain to reorganize and develop more efficiently, contributing to her progress.4. Individual Variability in Medication ResponseSensitivity to Medications: Every child responds differently to medications. Your daughter may have been particularly sensitive to the effects of valproic acid, even at a low dose. Discontinuing it may have removed a barrier to her natural development.Mood and Emotional Regulation: The occasional mood swings you describe could be a result of her brain adjusting to the absence of the medication. Over time, these may stabilize as her brain continues to adapt.5. Other ConsiderationsFine and Gross Motor Skills: While valproic acid is not typically associated with significant motor skill impairments, its sedative effects could have indirectly affected her motor development. Being off the medication may have allowed her to practice and improve these skills more effectively.Bowel and Bladder Control: The improvement in her awareness and ability to follow directions may also be contributing to better bathroom habits, though this is an area where additional support (e.g., behavioral interventions or occupational therapy) might still be beneficial.Next StepsMonitor Progress: Continue to observe her development closely. If the mood swings persist or worsen, it may be worth discussing with her neurologist or a developmental pediatrician.Therapies and Interventions: Given her progress, she may benefit from ongoing speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral interventions to further support her development.Regular Follow-ups: Maintain regular follow-ups with her neurologist to ensure that she remains seizure-free and to monitor her overall development.In summary, the changes you've observed in your daughter since discontinuing valproic acid are likely due to a combination of reduced sedation, improved brain function, and her natural developmental trajectory. It's a positive sign that she is more engaged and aware, and with continued support, she may continue to make significant strides in her development."

        "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \\\"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\\\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The phrase spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal in your EEG report refers to specific electrical patterns observed in your brain activity during the recording. Here's a breakdown of what it means:Spike and wave discharges: These are abnormal electrical patterns seen on an EEG. They are often associated with epilepsy or seizure activity. Spikes are sharp waves, and when they are followed by a slower wave, they form a spike and wave pattern. These discharges can indicate increased excitability in the brain, even if you didn't have a visible seizure during the recording.Right frontotemporal and central regions: This specifies the location in your brain where these abnormal discharges were most prominent. The right frontotemporal region is the area near the front and side of your brain on the right side, and the central region refers to the middle part of the brain. These areas are involved in various functions, including movement, language, and sensory processing.Maximally frontal: This means that the spike and wave discharges were most pronounced in the frontal lobe of your brain, which is responsible for functions like decision-making, problem-solving, and controlling voluntary movements.Even though you didn't have an actual seizure during the recording, the presence of spike and wave discharges suggests that there is abnormal electrical activity in your brain, which could be related to your history of partial seizures. This finding helps your neurologist better understand the nature of your condition and may guide treatment decisions.It's important to discuss these results with your neurologist when you can, as they can provide more context and explain how this finding relates to your symptoms and treatment plan. They may recommend adjustments to your medication, further testing, or other interventions based on this information."

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, and I appreciate you sharing your story. Navigating the healthcare system can be incredibly overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with serious health issues. Here are some steps and resources that might help you:1. Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid Program)Eligibility: Medi-Cal provides free or low-cost health coverage to low-income individuals and families. Given your current income and health condition, you might qualify. Even though your unemployment benefits are currently putting you over the income limit, there are exceptions for people with disabilities.Disability Determination: If your condition (e.g., seizures, brain cyst) is severe enough to prevent you from working, you might qualify for Medi-Cal based on disability. You would need a doctor to certify that you are disabled. The doctor in Mexico might be able to provide this, but you may need to get a U.S. doctor to confirm the diagnosis.Application: You can apply for Medi-Cal through Covered California or directly through your county social services office. Be sure to mention your health condition and the impact it has on your ability to work.2. Covered California (ObamaCare)Special Enrollment Period: If you lose your unemployment benefits, that would qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period, allowing you to sign up for a plan outside the usual open enrollment period.Cost-Sharing Reductions: Even if you don't qualify for subsidies based on income, you might still be eligible for cost-sharing reductions that lower your out-of-pocket costs (like deductibles and copayments).3. County Medical ServicesSan Diego County: Some counties in California have programs for low-income residents who don't qualify for Medi-Cal. Contact the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency to see if they have any programs that could help you.Charity Care: Some hospitals offer charity care programs for patients who can't afford to pay their medical bills. You can contact the hospital where you had the ER visit to see if they have such a program.4. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)SSDI: If your condition is severe enough to prevent you from working for at least 12 months, you might qualify for SSDI. This program provides monthly payments to people who are unable to work due to a disability.SSI: SSI is a needs-based program for low-income individuals with disabilities. If you qualify for SSI, you will automatically qualify for Medi-Cal.Application Process: The application process can be lengthy and often requires substantial medical documentation. It might be helpful to consult with a disability attorney or advocate to assist with your application.5. Short-Term DisabilityState Disability Insurance (SDI): If you have been paying into the state disability insurance program through your payroll taxes, you might be eligible for short-term disability benefits. This could provide some income while you are unable to work.Doctor's Certification: You will need a doctor to certify that you are unable to work due to your medical condition.6. Community Health CentersFree or Low-Cost Care: Community health centers provide medical services on a sliding fee scale based on income. You can find a health center near you through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) website.Mental Health Services: Given the stress and anxiety you're experiencing, it might be helpful to seek mental health support. Many community health centers offer mental health services.7. Non-Profit OrganizationsPatient Advocacy Groups: There are non-profit organizations that help people navigate the healthcare system and access care. Examples include the Patient Advocate Foundation and the HealthWell Foundation.Epilepsy Foundation: If your condition is related to seizures, the Epilepsy Foundation might have resources and support services that could help you.8. Medical Treatment in MexicoContinuity of Care: If you continue to seek treatment in Mexico, try to maintain continuity of care by seeing the same doctor or clinic. This will help ensure that your medical history is well-documented.Translation Services: If you need help translating your medical records from Spanish to English, there are services available that can assist with this.9. Legal AidLegal Assistance: If you're struggling with medical bills or insurance issues, legal aid organizations might be able to help. They can assist with negotiating medical bills, appealing insurance denials, and more.10. Next StepsCounty Worker: When you speak with the county worker, be sure to explain your entire situation, including your health condition, financial situation, and the impact on your ability to work. Ask specifically about any programs for people with disabilities or those in transitional periods.Documentation: Gather all your medical records, test results, and any other documentation that supports your case. This will be important for applying for disability benefits or Medi-Cal.Final ThoughtsIt's clear that you're in a difficult situation, but there are resources and programs that might be able to help. Don't hesitate to reach out to multiple organizations and agencies to explore all your options. It might also be helpful to consult with a social worker or patient advocate who can guide you through the process.I hope this information helps, and I wish you the best of luck in getting the care and support you need."

        "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've been facing with your health. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex and confusing situation, and it's understandable that you're seeking clarity. Let's break down some of the key points you've raised:1. Epileptic vs. Non-Epileptic SeizuresEpileptic Seizures: These are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Given your history of temporal lobe epilepsy, you're familiar with the typical symptoms, such as auras, post-ictal headaches, and specific seizure types (simple partial, complex partial, etc.).Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES): These can look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are often related to psychological stress or trauma and are classified as a type of functional neurological disorder (FND). NES can be triggered by emotional or physical stress, and they may occur in people with or without a history of epilepsy.2. Your SymptomsAura: The fact that you experience an aura before these episodes is interesting. Auras are typically associated with epileptic seizures, as they are essentially a simple partial seizure that precedes a larger event. However, some people with NES may also report aura-like symptoms, especially if they have a history of epilepsy.Different Presentation: The episodes you describe (face twitching, trouble breathing, less severe headache) do sound different from your typical seizures. This could suggest a different underlying cause, such as NES.Work-Related Stress: The fact that these episodes tend to happen at work could point to stress as a trigger. Stress is a common trigger for both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures, but it's particularly associated with NES.3. Awareness During SeizuresEpileptic Seizures: Depending on the type, you may or may not be aware during the seizure. For example, in complex partial seizures, awareness is often impaired.Non-Epileptic Seizures: People with NES are often aware of their surroundings during the episode, though this can vary. Some people may be partially aware, while others may not be aware at all.4. What Could Be Going On?New Manifestation of Epilepsy: It's possible that your epilepsy is evolving, and you're experiencing a new type of seizure. Epilepsy can change over time, especially if there have been significant changes in your brain (e.g., strokes, surgery).Non-Epileptic Seizures: Given the different presentation and the fact that these episodes are happening in a specific context (work), it's also possible that you're experiencing NES. The presence of an aura doesn't rule this out, especially if you have a long history of epilepsy.Mixed Seizures: Some people experience both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures, which can make diagnosis and management more challenging.5. Next StepsMedical Evaluation: It's important to discuss these new symptoms with your neurologist. They may recommend further testing, such as an EEG during one of these episodes, to determine whether the seizures are epileptic or non-epileptic.Video EEG Monitoring: This can be particularly helpful in distinguishing between epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. During a video EEG, you would be monitored for both brain activity and physical symptoms, which can help clarify the nature of the episodes.Psychological Evaluation: If NES is suspected, a psychological evaluation may be helpful to explore potential stressors or underlying psychological factors that could be contributing to the episodes.Stress Management: Regardless of the cause, stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, therapy, relaxation exercises) may help reduce the frequency of these episodes.6. Would You Be Aware?If these are non-epileptic seizures, it's possible that you could be aware during the episodes, but this isn't always the case. Awareness can vary depending on the individual and the specific nature of the seizure.ConclusionIt's definitely possible that you're experiencing a new type of seizure, whether epileptic or non-epileptic. The presence of an aura doesn't necessarily rule out NES, especially given your history. The best course of action is to work closely with your neurologist to investigate these episodes further. They may recommend additional testing or a referral to a specialist in functional neurological disorders.It's also worth considering that stress at work could be a contributing factor, so addressing any underlying stressors or seeking support from a therapist might be beneficial.I hope this helps, and I wish you the best in getting to the bottom of this."

        "question": "(24F, 5\\\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about the struggles you've been facing. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I appreciate you sharing your story. To answer your question: yes, it is possible that the anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) you were on for 14 years could have had an impact on your mood, and coming off them might have contributed to the mood swings you're experiencing now.Many anti-epileptic medications have mood-stabilizing properties and are sometimes used to treat mood disorders, even in people without epilepsy. For example:Lamotrigine: This is commonly used as a mood stabilizer, particularly for bipolar disorder, to prevent depressive episodes.Topiramate: While primarily used for epilepsy, it has also been used off-label to treat mood disorders and stabilize mood.Valproate (Epilim): This is another medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and stabilize mood.Keppra (Levetiracetam): This is less commonly associated with mood stabilization, but some people do experience mood-related side effects, both positive and negative, while on it.Given that you were on these medications for so long, it's possible that they were inadvertently helping to regulate your mood. When you stopped taking them, it could have disrupted this balance, leading to the mood swings and emotional instability you're now experiencing.What You Can Do:Discuss with Your Doctor: It\u2019s important to bring this up with your psychiatrist or GP. They may want to explore whether a mood stabilizer or a different approach to managing your mood swings could help. Since you\u2019re already on mirtazapine (an antidepressant), they might consider adjusting your treatment plan.Mood Tracking: Keeping a mood diary can help you and your doctor identify patterns in your mood swings. This can be useful for diagnosing any underlying mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder or cyclothymia.Therapy: Psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), can be very helpful for managing mood swings and emotional regulation.Review Your History: Since you have a history of non-epileptic seizures (which can be linked to psychological stress or trauma), it might be worth exploring whether there are underlying emotional or psychological factors contributing to both your seizures and your mood swings.Consider a Psychiatric Evaluation: Given the severity of your mood swings and the recent crisis, a thorough psychiatric evaluation could help clarify whether there\u2019s an underlying mood disorder that needs to be addressed.Important:Your safety is the top priority. If you ever feel at risk of harming yourself again, please seek immediate help by going to A&E or contacting a crisis helpline. You\u2019re not alone, and there are people who can support you through this.Let me know if you\u2019d like help finding resources or support in your area. You\u2019re taking a really important step by reaching out and thinking about these issues."

        "question": "This might be an odd one but I have had one seizure possibly (not confirmed but plausible) from other legally prescribed meds I was taking. I am on meds to control the seizures and have changed my diet,etc. I was wondering if I would be able to use a welder? I have had not issues for 3 years and do everything I can to make sure I am fine. I would be using every form of PPE available to me as wellAge 23, height 511, weight 180 complaint 2 years Male good health, no smoking and rare drinking , about 2 years",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great that you've taken steps to manage your health and have been seizure-free for three years. However, welding involves certain risks that need careful consideration, especially given your medical history. Here are some key points to think about:1. Seizure Triggers in WeldingFlashing Lights: Welding can produce intense, flickering light, which could potentially trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. While not everyone with a history of seizures is photosensitive, it\u2019s something to be cautious about.Heat and Stress: Welding can be physically demanding and may involve exposure to high temperatures, which could potentially stress your body. Stress and fatigue are known seizure triggers for some people.2. Safety ConsiderationsPPE (Personal Protective Equipment): While using proper PPE (helmet, gloves, etc.) is essential, it may not fully mitigate the risks associated with seizures. For example, if you were to have a seizure while welding, the consequences could be severe (e.g., burns, falls, or injury from equipment).Environment: Welding often involves working at heights, in confined spaces, or around heavy machinery. A seizure in these situations could be dangerous.3. Medical ClearanceConsult Your Doctor: Before taking up welding, it\u2019s crucial to discuss this with your neurologist or healthcare provider. They can assess your specific situation, including the type of seizures you\u2019ve had, your current medication regimen, and any potential risks.Seizure History: Since your seizure was possibly medication-induced and not confirmed to be epilepsy, your doctor may have a different perspective on your risk level. However, they will still need to evaluate whether welding is safe for you.4. Precautions if You ProceedAvoid Working Alone: If you decide to weld, always have someone nearby who knows about your medical history and can assist in case of an emergency.Limit Exposure to Triggers: Use welding helmets with auto-darkening lenses to reduce flickering light exposure. Take frequent breaks to avoid fatigue and overheating.Regular Monitoring: Continue to follow up with your doctor regularly to ensure your condition remains stable.5. Alternative OptionsIf welding poses too much risk, consider exploring related activities that are less hazardous, such as metal fabrication (using cold processes) or design work.Final ThoughtsWhile your three-year seizure-free period is a positive sign, welding introduces specific risks that need to be carefully weighed. Your health and safety should always come first. A thorough discussion with your doctor is the best next step to determine if welding is a safe activity for you. If they give you the green light, take every precaution to minimize risks."

        "question": "Weird version of sleep paralysis that feels like it\u2019s in my head and somethings rattlingSo I get this weird sleep paralysis and sometimes it happens multiple times a night. But it\u2019s like where I\u2019m paralized but idt I can open my eyes. It feels like my brain is \u201ctight\u201d. like my brain feels like it\u2019s rattling or something that could explode. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m in a hurricane. And sometimes I feel like I can control the feeling. Like if I ask myself a yes or no question. Bunch of times.. when an answers right the hurricane feeling will get much heavier. I have no clue how to explain it but this morning I felt like there was a \u201cmagnet\u201d moving my had to my forehead. The thing is my hand couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t actually move Bc I was laying on it but it was like in my imagination. It feels like my brain is zipped up. I sometimes think I can hear it. It happens when I\u2019m waking up, falling asleep, or laying in bed It\u2019s kinda like a whooshing feeling",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What you're describing sounds like a very intense and unusual form of sleep paralysis, combined with sensory and cognitive distortions that can feel deeply unsettling. Sleep paralysis itself is a well-documented phenomenon where the brain and body are out of sync during the transition between sleep and wakefulness, leaving you temporarily unable to move or speak. However, the additional sensations you're experiencing\u2014like the tightness, rattling, hurricane, or magnet feelings\u2014are less common and could be related to heightened sensory awareness or even hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations (vivid experiences that occur as you're falling asleep or waking up).Here are some possible explanations and suggestions for what you're experiencing:1. Sleep Paralysis with Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic HallucinationsDuring sleep paralysis, it's common to experience hallucinations that can feel incredibly real. These can be visual, auditory, or tactile (like the magnet sensation or the feeling of your brain rattling).The hurricane or whooshing feeling might be a sensory hallucination or a misinterpretation of your body's internal sensations as you transition between sleep and wakefulness.The feeling of control (e.g., answering yes/no questions and feeling the sensation intensify) could be a form of lucid dreaming or a semi-conscious attempt to influence the experience.2. Exploding Head Syndrome (EHS)This is a condition where people hear loud, sudden noises (like explosions, rattling, or whooshing) as they fall asleep or wake up. It can also be accompanied by feelings of pressure or tightness in the head.While EHS is usually auditory, it can sometimes involve other sensory distortions, like the tight or zipped up feeling you describe.3. Stress, Anxiety, or Sleep DeprivationHigh stress levels, anxiety, or lack of quality sleep can exacerbate sleep paralysis and make the accompanying sensations more intense.The feeling of your brain being tight or under pressure could be related to tension or hyperawareness caused by stress.4. Neurological or Sensory Processing QuirksSome people are more prone to sensory distortions during sleep transitions due to differences in how their brain processes sensory information.The magnet sensation or the feeling of your hand moving (even though it isn't) could be related to your brain's proprioceptive system (which tracks body position) being in a semi-dreamlike state.What You Can Do:Improve Sleep Hygiene:Stick to a consistent sleep schedule.Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals before bed.Create a calming bedtime routine to reduce stress and anxiety.Reduce Stress:Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to calm your mind before bed.Sleep Position:Some people find that sleeping on their back increases the likelihood of sleep paralysis. Try sleeping on your side or stomach to see if it helps.Stay Calm During Episodes:Remind yourself that sleep paralysis is temporary and harmless, even though it can feel frightening.Focus on trying to wiggle a finger or toe to help break the paralysis.Consult a Doctor or Sleep Specialist:If these episodes are frequent, distressing, or interfering with your quality of life, it might be worth seeing a healthcare professional. They can rule out underlying conditions like sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or other sleep disorders.Tracking Your Experiences:Keep a sleep diary to track when these episodes occur, how long they last, and any patterns (e.g., stress levels, sleep position, diet). This can help you and a healthcare professional identify triggers or contributing factors.What you're experiencing is undoubtedly strange and unsettling, but it\u2019s likely a combination of sleep paralysis, sensory hallucinations, and heightened awareness during sleep transitions. With some adjustments to your sleep habits and possibly professional guidance, you may be able to reduce the frequency or intensity of these episodes."

        "question": "24F In less than a month, 5\u20194\u201d, 114 lb, white. Marina, and occasional Tylenol. 9 months Postpartum, Arthritis, Depression, and Anxiety. No other drugs, or conditions. I\u2019ve been having seizure like things for about 4 months, the Dr\u2019s are confused by the full list of the symptoms, but believe they are seizures. It started with dizziness 6 months ago. So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG\u2019s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I\u2019m scared.. I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I\u2019m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn\u2019t have any \u201cepisodes\u201d yesterday, but couldn\u2019t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I\u2019m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr\u2019s that they might not be considering as an option.",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry you're going through this\u2014it sounds incredibly challenging, especially as a new mom. It\u2019s understandable to feel scared, but you\u2019re taking the right steps by seeking answers. Here\u2019s what you can expect and some thoughts on your situation:What to Expect During the EEG MonitoringSetup: You\u2019ll have electrodes placed on your scalp to monitor brain activity. These are connected to a machine that records your brain waves.Duration: Since previous shorter EEGs didn\u2019t capture anything, this extended monitoring (up to 5 days) increases the chances of catching an episode.Environment: You\u2019ll likely be in a hospital room, possibly with a camera to record your movements during episodes. This helps correlate physical symptoms with brain activity.Triggers: The medical team might try to provoke an episode (e.g., sleep deprivation, flashing lights, or hyperventilation) to capture data.Daily Activities: You\u2019ll be encouraged to go about your day as normally as possible within the hospital setting. This helps trigger episodes that might occur during routine activities.Tests After Epilepsy Is Ruled OutIf epilepsy is ruled out, the doctors will likely explore other possibilities. Here are some options they might consider:Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES): These are episodes that look like seizures but are caused by psychological stress or trauma rather than abnormal brain activity. They are real and treatable, often with therapy.Migraine Variants: Some types of migraines can cause neurological symptoms similar to seizures, including dizziness, speech issues, and motor control problems.Postpartum Conditions: Hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, and stress postpartum can trigger or exacerbate neurological or psychological symptoms.Autoimmune Disorders: Conditions like lupus or multiple sclerosis can cause neurological symptoms. Blood tests or imaging (like an MRI) might be ordered.Metabolic or Hormonal Imbalances: Thyroid issues, electrolyte imbalances, or blood sugar problems can cause seizure-like episodes.Functional Neurological Disorder (FND): This is a condition where the brain\u2019s communication with the body is disrupted, causing physical symptoms without structural damage.Vascular Issues: Problems with blood flow to the brain (e.g., transient ischemic attacks) can cause temporary symptoms.Medication Side Effects: While Tylenol is unlikely to cause seizures, it\u2019s worth discussing all medications and supplements with your doctor.What to Bring Up with Your DoctorsPostpartum Timeline: Since your symptoms started postpartum, emphasize this connection. Hormonal shifts and stress could be contributing factors.Mental Health: Depression and anxiety can sometimes manifest physically. Discuss whether these could be playing a role.Pain and Weakness: The stabbing arm pain and muscle weakness are unusual and should be highlighted.Memory and Speech Issues: These could point to a neurological condition, so make sure they\u2019re documented.Sleep Patterns: Poor sleep can exacerbate many conditions, so mention if you\u2019re not getting enough rest.Tips for Passing the TimeEntertainment: Bring books, a laptop, or a tablet for movies/shows. Download podcasts or audiobooks.Comfort Items: Bring your own pillow, blanket, or cozy clothes to make the hospital stay more comfortable.Journaling: Write down your thoughts, symptoms, or questions for the doctors. This can also help you process your emotions.Stay Connected: Use video calls to stay in touch with your baby and family.Relaxation: Practice deep breathing, meditation, or gentle stretching (if allowed) to manage anxiety.Coping as a New MomAsk for Help: Lean on your partner, family, or friends for support with your baby during this time.Self-Compassion: It\u2019s okay to feel scared or overwhelmed. You\u2019re doing your best in a tough situation.Mental Health Support: Consider therapy or support groups for postpartum depression and anxiety. These can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies.Final ThoughtsIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re advocating for yourself and seeking answers. While the process can feel overwhelming, the extended EEG monitoring is a crucial step toward understanding what\u2019s happening. Keep communicating openly with your doctors, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions or request further testing if needed.You\u2019re not alone in this, and with time, you\u2019ll find answers and a path forward. Wishing you strength and clarity as you navigate this challenging time."

        "question": "Height: 5'5\\\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \\\"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\\\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex interplay of factors, including a history of epilepsy, a past head injury, and PTSD, all of which could contribute to your current symptoms. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this:1. Neurologist ConsultationA neurologist would be the best specialist to evaluate your seizure history and determine whether your current symptoms (e.g., memory issues, fatigue, concentration difficulties) could be related to long-term effects of epilepsy or your head injury. They can review your recent normal EEG and assess whether you're at risk for future seizures or if you're likely \"in the clear.\"They can also help rule out other neurological conditions that might contribute to your symptoms.2. Neuropsychological EvaluationA neuropsychologist can provide a comprehensive assessment of your cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, executive functioning) and emotional state. This evaluation can help differentiate between cognitive deficits potentially caused by epilepsy or brain injury and those related to PTSD, anxiety, or depression.This type of evaluation is particularly useful for understanding how your brain is functioning now and identifying specific areas of difficulty.3. Psychiatric EvaluationA psychiatrist (an MD) can evaluate the role of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in your current symptoms. They can also assess whether your current medication (Adderall) is appropriate or if adjustments or additional medications (e.g., for anxiety or depression) might help.They can also provide insight into whether a stellate ganglion block (which is often used for PTSD) might be a reasonable option for you.4. Pain Management/Psychosomatic MedicineIf you're interested in exploring the stellate ganglion block, the pain center or a psychosomatic medicine specialist would be the place to start. However, this is typically considered after other treatments (e.g., therapy, medication) have been tried for PTSD.5. Therapist CollaborationWhile your LCSW can't address the medical side, she can collaborate with other providers (with your consent) to ensure a holistic approach to your care. Trauma-focused therapies (e.g., EMDR, CPT, or prolonged exposure therapy) are often helpful for PTSD.Long-Term Consequences of Seizure HistoryCognitive Effects: Early-life seizures, especially frequent ones, can sometimes lead to long-term cognitive difficulties, particularly in memory, attention, and executive functioning. However, your recent normal EEG is a good sign that your brain has likely recovered significantly.Emotional/Mental Health: Epilepsy and its treatment can contribute to anxiety, depression, and fatigue, which may overlap with PTSD symptoms.Seizure Freedom: Many people with childhood epilepsy outgrow it, especially if they've been seizure-free for years. Your normal EEG suggests a low likelihood of active epilepsy, but a neurologist can confirm this.Who to See First?Given your financial constraints, I would recommend starting with a neurologist to address the seizure history and head injury. If they rule out ongoing neurological issues, then a psychiatrist or neuropsychologist could help untangle the PTSD-related symptoms.Additional ConsiderationsHead Injury: Even though you didn't seek medical attention at the time, a neurologist can assess whether the riding accident might have caused any lasting effects.Adderall: While Adderall can help with concentration, it can sometimes exacerbate anxiety. A psychiatrist can evaluate whether it's still the right medication for you.Final ThoughtsIt\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you're taking the right steps by seeking answers. Start with a neurologist to address the seizure history and head injury, and then move on to a psychiatrist or neuropsychologist to address the PTSD and cognitive symptoms. This stepwise approach can help you prioritize your concerns and manage costs effectively."

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question.My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures.My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic EpilepsyDrugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 1000mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed.Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Hello! It's great that you're doing your research and considering the potential interactions between your epilepsy medications and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Your concern is valid, as hormonal changes can indeed influence seizure activity, and some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can interact with hormones.Key Points to Consider:Depakote (Valproate) and Hormones:Depakote is known to interact with hormones, particularly in females. It can increase testosterone levels and potentially lead to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other hormonal imbalances. However, in the context of male-to-female HRT, this interaction might be less pronounced.Depakote can also affect the metabolism of estrogen and progesterone, which are key components of feminizing HRT. This could theoretically alter the effectiveness of HRT or require dose adjustments.Keppra (Levetiracetam) and Hormones:Keppra generally has fewer interactions with hormones compared to Depakote. It is not known to significantly affect estrogen or progesterone levels, making it a relatively safe option in the context of HRT.HRT and Seizure Threshold:Estrogen is considered to be potentially pro-convulsant (may lower the seizure threshold), while progesterone has anti-convulsant properties (may raise the seizure threshold). The balance between these hormones in HRT could influence your seizure control.For individuals with epilepsy, particularly Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), hormonal fluctuations can be a trigger. Therefore, any changes in hormone levels due to HRT should be carefully monitored.Your Current Medications:Your current regimen of Depakote and Keppra is generally effective for JME. However, Depakote's potential interaction with hormones might require close monitoring if you start HRT.Keppra is less likely to interfere with HRT, so it may be a more stable component of your treatment during this transition.Recommendations:Consult Your Neurologist and Endocrinologist: Before starting HRT, it's crucial to discuss your plans with both your neurologist and an endocrinologist who has experience with transgender healthcare. They can help you navigate potential interactions and adjust your medications if necessary.Monitor Seizure Activity: If you proceed with HRT, you should closely monitor your seizure activity. Any increase in seizures should be reported to your neurologist immediately.Consider Alternative AEDs: If Depakote's interaction with hormones becomes problematic, your neurologist might consider switching you to another AED that has fewer hormonal interactions, such as Lamotrigine (Lamictal), which is often used in women with epilepsy due to its favorable profile.Regular Blood Tests: Regular monitoring of your Depakote levels, hormone levels, and liver function (since Depakote can affect liver enzymes) will be important during HRT.Conclusion:While there is a potential for interaction between Depakote and HRT, it doesn't mean you can't proceed with HRT. With careful planning, monitoring, and possibly adjusting your medications, many individuals with epilepsy successfully undergo HRT without significant issues. The key is to work closely with your healthcare providers to ensure that both your epilepsy and HRT are managed safely and effectively.Good luck with your journey, and I hope everything goes smoothly for you!"

        "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \\\"episodes\\\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \\\"episodes\\\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It sounds like you're dealing with a very challenging and distressing situation. While I can't provide a diagnosis or medical advice, I can offer some information and suggestions that might help you navigate this situation.1. Epilepsy and Absence SeizuresAbsence seizures, which are a type of epilepsy, can cause symptoms like staring spells, lack of responsiveness, and sometimes memory lapses. However, the episodes you're describing\u2014lasting for hours and involving altered perception of time, colors, and surroundings\u2014are not typical for classic absence seizures. This could suggest that there might be more going on than just epilepsy.2. Possible Differential DiagnosesComplex Partial Seizures (Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures): These seizures can cause altered consciousness, unusual perceptions, and prolonged episodes. They might not always show up on a routine EEG, especially if the seizure activity is deep in the brain.Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES): These can look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can be related to stress, trauma, or psychological factors.Migraine with Aura: Some types of migraines can cause visual disturbances, altered perception, and prolonged episodes of confusion or disorientation.Psychiatric Conditions: Conditions like dissociation, depersonalization, or derealization can cause feelings of unreality, detachment, and altered perception. These can sometimes be triggered by stress, anxiety, or trauma.Other Neurological Conditions: Conditions like temporal lobe epilepsy, encephalitis, or other brain disorders could also cause similar symptoms.3. Next StepsSeek a Second Opinion: If your current doctor is not taking your symptoms seriously or if the treatment isn't working, it might be helpful to see another neurologist, preferably one who specializes in epilepsy or complex neurological conditions.Video EEG Monitoring: Since your routine EEGs are normal, you might benefit from a longer video EEG monitoring session, where you are observed for several days in a hospital setting. This can help capture any unusual brain activity during your episodes.Consider a Neuropsychiatric Evaluation: Given the complexity of your symptoms, a neuropsychiatrist might be able to evaluate whether there are psychological factors contributing to your condition.Review Your Medications: It's possible that your current medications are not fully controlling your seizures or that they are contributing to some of your symptoms (e.g., fatigue, depression). Discuss with your doctor whether adjusting your medication regimen might help.4. Lifestyle and Coping StrategiesStress Management: Stress can exacerbate both epilepsy and non-epileptic episodes. Techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or therapy might help.Sleep Hygiene: Ensure you're getting enough rest, as sleep deprivation can trigger seizures.Avoid Triggers: If you notice that certain stimuli (like bright lights or loud noises) trigger your episodes, try to minimize exposure to them.5. Mental Health SupportLiving with a chronic condition like epilepsy can be emotionally taxing. It might be helpful to speak with a therapist or counselor who can help you cope with the emotional impact of your condition.6. Keep a Symptom DiaryDocumenting your episodes in detail\u2014when they occur, how long they last, what you experience, and any potential triggers\u2014can provide valuable information for your doctor.7. Advocate for YourselfIt's important to communicate clearly with your healthcare providers about how your symptoms are affecting your quality of life. If you feel dismissed or unheard, don't hesitate to seek care elsewhere.ConclusionYour symptoms are complex and may not be fully explained by your current diagnosis of epilepsy. It's crucial to continue advocating for yourself and seek further evaluation to ensure you're getting the most accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. You deserve to have your symptoms taken seriously and to receive the care you need to improve your quality of life."

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing struggles with these episodes. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated. While I can't provide a definitive diagnosis, I can offer some insights and suggestions that might help you navigate the next two months until your neurology appointment.Key Considerations:Vasovagal Syncope vs. Neurological Causes:Your cardiologists have identified vasovagal syncope as a likely cause, given the heart pauses recorded by your loop recorder. However, the presence of deja vu, surreal feelings, and memory issues raises the possibility of a neurological component, such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or another seizure disorder.Vasovagal syncope typically doesn't cause deja vu or memory problems, which are more suggestive of focal seizures (seizures originating in a specific part of the brain, like the temporal lobe).Hormonal Influences:The pattern of episodes occurring in the week before your period suggests a possible hormonal link. Catamenial epilepsy (seizures linked to the menstrual cycle) is a known phenomenon, and hormonal fluctuations (e.g., estrogen and progesterone) can influence both cardiac and neurological systems.Stress, even if managed well, can also exacerbate both vasovagal episodes and seizure activity.Sinus Pauses and Epilepsy:While sinus pauses are typically cardiac in origin, there are rare cases where autonomic effects of seizures (e.g., ictal bradycardia or asystole) can cause heart rhythm disturbances. This is more common in temporal lobe epilepsy.Memory and Cognitive Issues:The worsening memory issues could be related to repeated episodes of reduced cerebral perfusion (from the heart pauses) or post-ictal states (if these are seizures). It\u2019s important to investigate this further with a neurologist.Suggestions for the Next Two Months:Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:Track the timing of episodes, including your menstrual cycle, stress levels, food/water intake, and any warning signs (e.g., deja vu, surreal feelings).Note the duration of symptoms, recovery time, and any cognitive or physical after-effects.Discuss a Tilt Table Test:If not already done, a tilt table test can help confirm vasovagal syncope and rule out other causes of fainting.Consider a Holter Monitor or Extended EEG:A Holter monitor (if not already done) can provide more detailed cardiac monitoring.An ambulatory EEG (electroencephalogram) could help detect seizure activity, especially if episodes are frequent.Hormonal Evaluation:Discuss with your primary care doctor or gynecologist whether hormonal imbalances (e.g., estrogen, progesterone) could be contributing. Tracking your cycle and symptoms may help identify patterns.Pacemaker Discussion:If the cardiologists are recommending a pacemaker, it\u2019s worth understanding the risks and benefits. A pacemaker can address the heart pauses but won\u2019t treat any underlying neurological cause.Neurology Preparation:Write down all your symptoms, including the deja vu, surreal feelings, memory issues, and any other neurological symptoms (e.g., d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, jamais vu, olfactory hallucinations, or automatisms like lip-smacking or repetitive movements).Bring your loop recorder data and any other test results to the neurologist.Possible Next Steps:Neurological Workup:The neurologist may order an MRI to look for structural abnormalities in the brain (e.g., temporal lobe lesions) and an EEG to check for seizure activity.If epilepsy is suspected, they may consider a trial of anti-seizure medication.Autonomic Testing:If autonomic dysfunction (e.g., postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS) is suspected, autonomic testing could be helpful.Multidisciplinary Approach:Given the overlap between cardiac and neurological symptoms, a team approach involving cardiology, neurology, and possibly endocrinology may be needed.Things to Monitor:Warning Signs:If you experience new or worsening symptoms (e.g., prolonged confusion, weakness, or speech difficulties), seek medical attention immediately.Safety Precautions:Since episodes are occurring while standing and sleeping, take extra precautions to avoid injury (e.g., avoid driving, use a medical alert bracelet, and inform those around you about what to do if you faint).Final Thoughts:Your symptoms could be due to a combination of cardiac and neurological factors, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re pursuing a neurology referral. The deja vu, surreal feelings, and memory issues are particularly concerning for a neurological cause, and the hormonal pattern suggests this could be a contributing factor. In the meantime, continue to track your symptoms closely and advocate for yourself with your doctors. A pacemaker may address the cardiac aspect, but it\u2019s important to rule out or treat any neurological causes as well.Hang in there, and I hope you get some answers and relief soon!"

I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \\\"brain electric feeling\\\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this\u2014it sounds incredibly distressing and exhausting. What you're describing does share some similarities with sleep paralysis, but there are also elements that could suggest other underlying conditions, such as seizures, sleep disorders, or even neurological issues. Here's a breakdown of what you're experiencing and some steps you can consider:Key Symptoms and Possible ExplanationsSleep Paralysis-Like Symptoms:Inability to move, awareness of surroundings, ominous aura, and hallucinations (visual, auditory, or tactile) are classic signs of sleep paralysis. This occurs when your brain wakes up while your body is still in REM sleep paralysis (a normal state during dreaming).The floating out of body sensation could be related to a hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucination, which sometimes accompanies sleep paralysis.Pain, Buzzing, and Electric Sensations:These symptoms are less typical of standard sleep paralysis and could suggest something else, such as:Seizures: Some types of seizures (e.g., focal seizures) can cause strange sensations, pain, or electric-like feelings in the brain or body.Neurological Issues: Conditions like migraines, nerve issues, or even restless legs syndrome could cause similar sensations.Sleep Apnea: If you suspect undiagnosed sleep apnea, this could be contributing to fragmented sleep and unusual sensations during sleep.Floating, Spiraling, and Voices:These could still fall under the umbrella of sleep-related hallucinations, but they could also overlap with conditions like narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that can cause vivid hallucinations and sleep paralysis).Aftereffects:Feeling drained, sore, and foggy after an episode could point to disrupted sleep quality, which might be exacerbated by sleep apnea or another sleep disorder.What You Can Do Right NowSince you're unable to see a doctor immediately, here are some steps to help manage your symptoms and gather more information:Sleep Hygiene:Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends.Avoid caffeine, heavy meals, or screens close to bedtime.Create a calming bedtime routine to reduce anxiety around sleep.Sleep Position:Sleeping on your side is good, but if you suspect sleep apnea, try elevating your head slightly with a pillow to keep your airway open.Track Your Symptoms:Keep a detailed sleep diary. Note when episodes occur, how long they last, what you felt, and any potential triggers (e.g., stress, sleep deprivation, certain foods).Reduce Stress and Anxiety:Stress can exacerbate sleep paralysis and other sleep issues. Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.Avoid Sleep Deprivation:Breaking the cycle of sleep deprivation is crucial. Even if you're afraid of an episode, try to prioritize getting enough sleep.Consider Over-the-Counter Solutions:If you suspect sleep apnea, you could try over-the-counter nasal strips or devices to help with breathing during sleep. However, these are not a substitute for a proper diagnosis.When to Seek Medical HelpWhile it's understandable that you're unable to see a doctor right now, some symptoms warrant urgent attention. If you experience any of the following, try to find a way to consult a healthcare provider:Episodes that last longer than a few minutes.Loss of consciousness or confusion after an episode.Severe or worsening pain.Symptoms that occur during the day (not just around sleep).Any signs of a seizure, such as rhythmic jerking, loss of bladder control, or prolonged confusion after an episode.Long-Term StepsTelehealth Consultation:Many doctors offer virtual appointments, which could be a safer option given your family's health concerns. This might help you get preliminary advice or a referral for a sleep study.Sleep Study (Polysomnography):Once it's safe for you to visit a healthcare provider, a sleep study could help diagnose sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or other sleep disorders.Neurological Evaluation:If seizures or another neurological condition is suspected, a neurologist can perform tests like an EEG to rule out epilepsy or other issues.Final ThoughtsWhat you're experiencing is not just normal sleep paralysis, and it's understandable that you're worried. While it may not be an emergency, it\u2019s important to address this when you can. In the meantime, focus on improving your sleep habits and tracking your symptoms. If you ever feel like your symptoms are escalating or becoming unmanageable, don\u2019t hesitate to seek urgent care.You're not alone in this, and there are treatments and strategies that can help. Hang in there, and I hope you find relief soon."

        "question": "Male 18 75kg 6ft black I started having these episodes last December. So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but based on what you've described, your symptoms could potentially be related to a neurological condition, such as epilepsy, migraines with aura, or another issue affecting the brain. The episodes you're experiencing\u2014deja vu, dizziness, headaches, and memory lapses\u2014could be consistent with focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures) or migraine auras. The memory gaps and confusion after the car crash also raise concerns about possible neurological involvement.Here\u2019s a breakdown of what might be going on:1. Focal Aware Seizures (Simple Partial Seizures)These seizures can cause symptoms like deja vu, dizziness, headaches, and memory lapses without loss of consciousness.The episodes you describe (lasting 5-10 seconds with a specific memory or feeling) could be a type of seizure activity.The memory gaps and confusion after the car crash could also be related to a seizure, especially if you experienced one around the time of the accident.2. Migraine with AuraSome people experience neurological symptoms (like deja vu, dizziness, or visual disturbances) before a migraine headache. This is called an \"aura.\"The headache and dizziness you describe could be part of a migraine episode.However, migraines typically last longer than 10 seconds, so this might not fully explain your symptoms.3. Transient Global Amnesia (TGA)This is a temporary loss of memory, often triggered by stress or a traumatic event (like a car crash). It\u2019s usually short-lived and resolves on its own.However, TGA doesn\u2019t typically involve recurring episodes like the ones you\u2019ve been having.4. Psychological FactorsStress, anxiety, or panic attacks can sometimes cause symptoms like dizziness, memory lapses, and confusion.The panic attack you experienced at work could be related to your concerns about your health, but it\u2019s important to rule out physical causes first.5. Other PossibilitiesBrain Tumor: While this is rare, symptoms like recurring headaches, dizziness, and memory issues can sometimes be caused by a tumor. However, this is less likely without other symptoms like persistent nausea, vision changes, or weakness.Concussion or Brain Injury: If you hit your head during the car crash, it\u2019s possible you sustained a mild concussion, which could explain the memory gaps and confusion.What You Should Do:See a Doctor Immediately:You need to see a neurologist to evaluate your symptoms. They may recommend tests like:EEG (Electroencephalogram): To check for abnormal brain activity (e.g., seizures).MRI or CT Scan: To rule out structural issues like a tumor or injury.Blood Tests: To check for other potential causes (e.g., vitamin deficiencies, infections).Keep a Symptom Diary:Write down when these episodes happen, how long they last, and any triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, alcohol). This can help your doctor diagnose the issue.Avoid Triggers:Limit alcohol and smoking, as these can potentially worsen neurological symptoms.Make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep and managing stress.Don\u2019t Drive Until Cleared:If these episodes could be seizures, it\u2019s important to avoid driving until you\u2019ve been evaluated by a doctor. Seizures can impair your ability to drive safely.When to Seek Emergency Care:If you experience any of the following, go to the emergency room immediately:A seizure lasting more than 5 minutes.Loss of consciousness.Severe headache unlike anything you\u2019ve felt before.Weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking.It\u2019s great that you\u2019re paying attention to your symptoms and seeking answers. While it\u2019s natural to worry about serious conditions like epilepsy or a brain tumor, many of these symptoms can also be caused by less severe issues. A neurologist will be able to provide a clearer picture and guide you toward the right treatment. Don\u2019t delay\u2014make an appointment as soon as possible."

        "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\\\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \\\"drink more water\\\", \\\"eat more salt\\\", and (my favorite) \\\"sometimes girls faint\\\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Fainting, or syncope, can be a distressing experience, especially when it happens repeatedly in specific situations like during flights. Given your medical history and the extensive workup you've already had, it seems that the most likely cause of your fainting episodes is related to vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension, potentially exacerbated by the unique environment of an airplane (e.g., lower oxygen levels, dehydration, prolonged sitting, and changes in cabin pressure). Here\u2019s a breakdown of potential causes and strategies to help prevent fainting during your upcoming flight:Possible Causes of Your Fainting EpisodesVasovagal Syncope:This is the most common cause of fainting and is triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to reduced blood flow to the brain.Triggers can include dehydration, stress, pain, heat, or prolonged sitting/standing.The airplane environment (e.g., mild hypoxia, anxiety, or dehydration) might be a specific trigger for you.Orthostatic Hypotension:This occurs when blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing or changing positions (e.g., waking up from sleep on a plane).Dehydration, low salt intake, or autonomic nervous system dysfunction can contribute.Hypothyroidism and Hashimoto\u2019s:While your Synthroid dose seems to be managing your thyroid levels, fluctuations in thyroid hormone levels can affect blood pressure and heart rate, potentially contributing to fainting.Dehydration and Low Blood Volume:Airplane cabins have very low humidity, which can lead to dehydration even if you\u2019re drinking water.Dehydration reduces blood volume, making it harder for your body to maintain blood pressure.Autonomic Dysfunction:Some people have a sensitive autonomic nervous system, which can overreact to stressors like changes in cabin pressure, mild hypoxia, or anxiety.Anxiety or Stress:Anxiety about flying or fainting can trigger a vasovagal response, creating a vicious cycle.Prevention Strategies for Your FlightHere are some additional steps you can take to minimize the risk of fainting during your 14-hour flight:1. Hydration and ElectrolytesIncrease fluid intake: Aim for at least 64 oz of water, as you\u2019re already doing, but consider adding an electrolyte drink (e.g., Pedialyte, Liquid IV, or a low-sugar sports drink) to maintain electrolyte balance.Avoid overhydration: Drinking too much water without electrolytes can dilute your sodium levels, potentially worsening fainting.2. Salt and NutritionSalt intake: Continue using salt tablets, as they help retain fluid and maintain blood pressure. You can also eat salty snacks like pretzels or nuts.Regular meals: Eat balanced meals with protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs before and during the flight to stabilize blood sugar.3. Compression and MovementCompression socks: These are great for improving circulation. Consider adding abdominal compression (e.g., a high-waist compression garment) to help maintain blood pressure.Move frequently: Stand up, stretch, and walk around the cabin every 1-2 hours to prevent blood pooling in your legs.Seated exercises: Perform ankle pumps, calf raises, and leg stretches while seated to promote circulation.4. Temperature RegulationDress in layers: Wear breathable clothing that you can easily remove if you feel hot.Cooling tools: Bring a small handheld fan or cooling towel to use if you start feeling overheated.5. Manage AnxietyBreathing exercises: Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system if you feel dizzy or anxious.Distraction: Bring activities (books, movies, music) to keep your mind occupied and reduce stress.Medication: If anxiety is a significant trigger, talk to your doctor about a short-acting anti-anxiety medication (e.g., lorazepam) for the flight.6. Medical ConsiderationsCheck thyroid levels: Ensure your TSH, T3, and T4 levels are optimal. Even mild hypothyroidism can affect blood pressure and heart rate.Monitor blood pressure: If you have a home blood pressure monitor, check your readings before the flight to ensure they\u2019re within a normal range.Discuss medications: Ask your doctor about medications like midodrine (a vasopressor) or fludrocortisone (a mineralocorticoid) that can help prevent fainting in people with recurrent syncope.7. In-Flight StrategiesRecline your seat: Keeping your legs elevated slightly can improve blood flow.Alert the crew: Inform the flight attendants about your history of fainting so they can assist you quickly if needed.Carry a medical alert card: This can explain your condition to others if you faint and are unable to communicate.When to Seek Further EvaluationIf your fainting episodes continue despite these measures, consider the following:Tilt-table test: This can help diagnose vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension.Autonomic testing: This evaluates how well your autonomic nervous system regulates blood pressure and heart rate.Holter monitor: This can rule out rare arrhythmias that might only occur during specific triggers (e.g., flying).Final ThoughtsYour fainting episodes are likely multifactorial, involving a combination of dehydration, low blood volume, autonomic sensitivity, and the unique stressors of air travel. By taking proactive steps to manage hydration, salt intake, circulation, and anxiety, you can significantly reduce the risk of fainting during your flight. If possible, consult your doctor before your trip to review your current strategies and explore additional medical options.Safe travels, and I hope your upcoming flight goes smoothly!"

        "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles, and it sounds like you've been through a lot since your epilepsy diagnosis. It's frustrating when doctors don't fully listen or understand what you're experiencing, and it's even more isolating when others in similar situations (like on r/epilepsy) don't seem to share your specific symptoms. Let me try to break this down and offer some thoughts that might help you navigate this.1. Energy Levels and EpilepsyMedication Side Effects: Keppra (levetiracetam) is known to cause fatigue, weakness, and mood changes in some people. While many people on Keppra might not experience the same extreme energy drain you're describing, it's possible that your body is reacting differently to the medication. Everyone metabolizes drugs differently, and your experience could be unique.Post-Seizure Fatigue: Seizures themselves can be incredibly draining, both physically and mentally. Even if you don't feel the immediate effects, your brain and body might still be recovering, which could contribute to your lack of energy.Neurological Changes: Epilepsy can alter brain function in ways that aren't fully understood. It's possible that the seizures or the underlying cause of your epilepsy have affected areas of your brain responsible for energy regulation, motivation, or physical endurance.2. Weight Loss, Weight Gain, and EnergyMetabolic Changes: Rapid weight loss before your diagnosis might have stressed your body, and the subsequent weight gain could be related to changes in metabolism, medication side effects, or reduced physical activity. It's also possible that your body is struggling to adapt to these changes, which could contribute to your fatigue.Vicious Cycle: It's not uncommon for people to lose motivation to exercise when they feel physically unable to perform as they once did. This can lead to weight gain, which then makes exercise even harder, creating a cycle that's difficult to break.3. Autoimmune Disease and EpilepsyAutoimmune Epilepsy: There is growing recognition of autoimmune causes of epilepsy. Conditions like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, lupus, or Hashimoto's encephalopathy can cause seizures and are often accompanied by other symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, or systemic inflammation. If you suspect an autoimmune component, you could ask your doctor about testing for autoimmune markers or consulting a neurologist who specializes in autoimmune epilepsy.Leaky Gut and Inflammation: While the concept of leaky gut is still controversial in mainstream medicine, there is evidence that intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation can contribute to a range of health issues, including neurological conditions. If you're exploring this, consider working with a functional medicine practitioner or dietitian who can guide you through an elimination diet or other interventions to see if reducing inflammation improves your symptoms.4. Next StepsAdvocate for Yourself: If your current doctors aren't taking your concerns seriously, consider seeking a second opinion, especially from a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy or autoimmune conditions. You might also benefit from seeing an endocrinologist to rule out hormonal imbalances or metabolic issues.Track Your Symptoms: Keep a detailed journal of your energy levels, seizures, diet, exercise, and any other symptoms. This can help you identify patterns and provide concrete data to show your doctors.Explore Alternative Therapies: While not a replacement for medical treatment, therapies like acupuncture, yoga, or mindfulness practices might help with energy levels and stress management. Some people with epilepsy also find relief with ketogenic diets, which are worth discussing with your doctor.Mental Health Support: Dealing with chronic illness, weight changes, and the loss of your career can take a toll on your mental health. Consider talking to a therapist who specializes in chronic illness or joining a support group for people with epilepsy.5. Final ThoughtsIt's clear that you're motivated to understand what's happening to your body, and that's a great first step. While the medical system can be frustrating, don't give up on finding answers. Your experience is valid, and there may be underlying factors (like autoimmune issues or medication sensitivity) that haven't been fully explored yet. Keep advocating for yourself, and consider reaching out to specialists who might have a fresh perspective on your case.Let me know if you'd like help finding resources or crafting questions to ask your doctors. You're not alone in this, and there are people out there who can help you figure it out."

        "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but based on your description, your symptoms are concerning and warrant a thorough evaluation by a neurologist. Here are some possibilities that could explain your symptoms, though only a medical professional can provide a definitive diagnosis:1. Seizure or EpilepsyYour episode at work, with involuntary movements, hyperventilation, and post-episode confusion, could suggest a seizure. The freezing episodes you\u2019ve been experiencing since then might be focal seizures (previously called partial seizures), which can cause brief lapses in awareness, staring, or involuntary movements without a full convulsive seizure.The aura you described (a strange feeling before an episode) is also common in seizures.Seizures can sometimes be triggered by stress, lack of sleep, or even certain medications or substances, including nitrous oxide (laughing gas).2. Reaction to Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas)Nitrous oxide is generally safe, but in rare cases, it can cause neurological side effects, especially if you have an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide can inactivate vitamin B12, which is essential for nerve function. A severe deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, confusion, and even seizures.If you have a history of poor diet, gastrointestinal issues, or other risk factors for B12 deficiency, this could be a contributing factor.3. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or StrokeWhile less likely given your age and normal CT scan, a TIA (mini-stroke) can cause sudden neurological symptoms like difficulty speaking, weakness, or confusion. However, these symptoms typically resolve within minutes to hours, and imaging would usually show evidence of a stroke.4. Migraine with AuraSome people experience migraine episodes with aura that can mimic seizures or strokes. These auras can include visual disturbances, confusion, difficulty speaking, or even weakness. However, migraines are usually accompanied by a headache, which you didn\u2019t mention.5. Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)These are episodes that resemble seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are often related to stress or psychological factors. However, given your lack of history with anxiety or panic attacks, this seems less likely.6. Other Neurological ConditionsConditions like multiple sclerosis (MS), encephalitis, or other brain disorders could cause similar symptoms, but these would typically show abnormalities on imaging or other tests.What You Should Do:See a Neurologist ASAP: Since you\u2019re already scheduled, make sure to provide them with a detailed account of your symptoms, including the laughing gas exposure. They may recommend an EEG (to check for seizure activity), an MRI (to look for structural issues in the brain), and blood tests (to check for vitamin deficiencies or other metabolic issues).Mention Nitrous Oxide Exposure: Let the neurologist know about the laughing gas and how you felt afterward. They may want to check your vitamin B12 levels and consider whether the nitrous oxide could have played a role.Keep a Symptom Diary: Document every episode of freezing, including what you were doing, how long it lasted, and any triggers or patterns you notice. This will help the neurologist make a diagnosis.Avoid Driving or Risky Activities: Until you have a clear diagnosis and treatment plan, avoid activities that could put you or others at risk if you were to have another episode.Red Flags to Watch For:If you experience another episode lasting more than a few minutes.If you develop new symptoms like severe headache, weakness on one side of your body, or vision changes.If you feel increasingly confused or disoriented.Your symptoms are concerning, but the good news is that you\u2019ve already had some initial tests (CT scan, EKG, blood work) that ruled out life-threatening causes like a stroke or heart issue. The next step is to work with the neurologist to get to the bottom of this. Hang in there, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek emergency care if things worsen."

        "answer": "Birth asphyxia, which occurs when a baby doesn\u2019t receive enough oxygen before, during, or immediately after birth, can indeed have long-term effects depending on its severity and duration. While many children recover fully, others may experience complications that can affect their development and health later in life. Here\u2019s how your history of birth asphyxia might relate to your current concerns:1. ADHD/ADD and Birth AsphyxiaThere is some evidence suggesting a link between birth complications, including asphyxia, and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD. Oxygen deprivation during birth can potentially affect brain development, particularly in areas responsible for attention, impulse control, and executive functioning. However, ADHD is a complex condition with genetic, environmental, and neurological factors, so it\u2019s unlikely that birth asphyxia alone would be the sole cause.2. Sensitivity to Flashing LightsYour sensitivity to flashing lights could be related to a heightened neurological response, which might be influenced by your early brain development. Birth asphyxia can sometimes lead to subtle changes in brain function, including increased susceptibility to sensory stimuli. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have a seizure disorder, it\u2019s worth noting that:Photosensitivity (sensitivity to flashing lights) is a common feature of certain types of epilepsy, but it can also occur in people without epilepsy.If you\u2019re concerned about seizures, it\u2019s important to consult a neurologist. They can evaluate whether your symptoms are related to a seizure disorder or another neurological condition.3. Other Potential Long-Term Effects of Birth AsphyxiaCognitive and Learning Difficulties: Some individuals who experienced birth asphyxia may have mild cognitive impairments or learning difficulties, though this varies widely.Motor Impairments: In more severe cases, birth asphyxia can lead to conditions like cerebral palsy, which affects movement and coordination.Behavioral and Emotional Issues: There may be an increased risk of anxiety, mood disorders, or behavioral challenges, though these are often influenced by multiple factors.What You Can Do:Consult a Specialist: If you haven\u2019t already, consider seeing a neurologist or developmental specialist to discuss your history and current symptoms. They can help determine if there\u2019s a connection between your birth asphyxia and your ADHD or sensitivity to flashing lights.Neuropsychological Testing: This can provide insights into how your brain functions and whether there are any specific areas affected by your early experiences.Monitor Symptoms: Keep track of your reactions to flashing lights or any other unusual symptoms. If they worsen or interfere with your daily life, seek medical advice.Final Thoughts:While birth asphyxia can contribute to certain challenges, many people who experienced it go on to live healthy, fulfilling lives. Your ADHD and sensitivity to lights may or may not be directly linked to your birth experience, but understanding your history can help you and your healthcare providers make informed decisions about your care. If you\u2019re curious or concerned, don\u2019t hesitate to explore these issues further with a medical professional."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand your symptoms. It's important to follow up with your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.Possible Explanations for Your Symptoms:Phantom Smells (Olfactory Hallucinations):These can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, anxiety, migraines, sinus issues, or neurological conditions. Since your EEG ruled out temporal lobe epilepsy, it\u2019s less likely to be related to seizures, but other causes like stress or sinus problems could still be at play.Eye Floaters and Flashing Lights:Eye floaters are common and often harmless, especially in bright light. However, flashing lights can sometimes indicate retinal issues (e.g., retinal detachment or migraines). It\u2019s worth seeing an ophthalmologist to rule out any serious eye conditions.Muscle Twitching, Headaches, and Lightheadedness:These symptoms can be linked to stress, anxiety, fatigue, or even nutritional deficiencies (e.g., low iron, magnesium, or vitamin B12). Stress and anxiety can also cause muscle tension, leading to headaches and twitching.Cognitive Symptoms (Word-finding difficulties, Daydreaming):Stress, anxiety, and depression can significantly impact concentration, memory, and cognitive function. This could explain why you\u2019re experiencing difficulty focusing or losing your train of thought.Tooth Decay:Dental issues like a decaying tooth can sometimes cause referred pain or even systemic symptoms if left untreated. It\u2019s important to address this with a dentist.Stress and Anxiety:Stress can absolutely cause or exacerbate a wide range of physical symptoms, including those you\u2019ve described. Chronic stress can affect your nervous system, immune system, and overall health, leading to symptoms like muscle twitching, headaches, lightheadedness, and even phantom smells.Next Steps:Follow Up with Your GP: If you\u2019re still concerned, ask your GP for further tests or referrals (e.g., to a neurologist or ophthalmologist) to rule out any underlying conditions.Address Stress and Anxiety: Consider therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) or stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, exercise) to help manage your anxiety and depression.Dental Care: See a dentist to address the decaying tooth, as this could be contributing to your overall discomfort.Nutritional Check: Ask your GP to check for deficiencies (e.g., iron, vitamin B12, magnesium) that could be contributing to your symptoms.Reassurance:While your symptoms are concerning to you, many of them can be explained by stress, anxiety, or other non-life-threatening conditions. It\u2019s good that your GP isn\u2019t overly worried about a brain tumor, but if your symptoms persist or worsen, don\u2019t hesitate to seek a second opinion or further testing.Take care of your mental and physical health, and try to reduce stress where possible. You\u2019re not alone in this, and many of these symptoms can improve with time and proper care."

        "question": "Hello all, I had a question about my medication and fasting, if that's alright. I take Keppra twice a day (500mg each), once in the morning and once at night. With Ramadan approaching I was wondering how much time there needs to be in between taking one pill at night and one in the morning, thanks.Let me know if I need to add anything else.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Hello! It's great that you're planning ahead for Ramadan while managing your medication. Keppra (levetiracetam) is an antiepileptic drug, and it's important to maintain consistent levels of it in your body to ensure its effectiveness. Typically, Keppra is taken every 12 hours to maintain stable blood levels, but your specific dosing schedule should be confirmed with your healthcare provider.During Ramadan, if you're fasting from dawn to sunset, you can adjust your dosing schedule to fit your eating and fasting times. For example:Night dose (after Iftar): Take your first dose after breaking your fast at sunset (Iftar).Morning dose (before Suhoor): Take your second dose before starting your fast at dawn (Suhoor).This way, you can maintain approximately a 12-hour interval between doses. However, the exact timing may vary depending on your location and the length of your fast. It's crucial to consult your doctor or pharmacist to ensure this adjusted schedule is safe and effective for you. They may also consider factors like your seizure control and overall health.If you experience any issues or have concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider. Ramadan Mubarak in advance! Let me know if you have more questions."

        "question": "Recently I got a hickie, and tons of people started telling me to be careful because I could die, and stuff. Is it that dangerous? Male 17, epilepsy, anxiety, question: are hickies dangerous?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Hickeys, also known as love bites or kiss marks, are generally not dangerous. They occur when suction breaks small blood vessels under the skin, causing bruising. While they can look dramatic, they are usually harmless and heal on their own within a week or two.However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind, especially given your medical history:Epilepsy: If you have epilepsy, it's important to manage stress and avoid situations that could potentially trigger a seizure. While a hickey itself is unlikely to cause a seizure, the anxiety or stress from the situation might. Make sure you're following your treatment plan and taking any prescribed medications.Anxiety: If the attention or comments from others about the hickey are causing you significant anxiety, it's important to address this. Anxiety can be managed through various techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness, or talking to a trusted friend or counselor.Rare Complications: In extremely rare cases, excessive suction on the neck could potentially lead to more serious issues, such as blood clots or damage to major blood vessels. However, this is highly unlikely from a typical hickey.Social Considerations: Hickeys can draw attention and comments, which might be uncomfortable for some people. If you're concerned about this, you can cover the hickey with clothing or makeup until it fades.In summary, hickeys are generally not dangerous, but it's important to manage any anxiety or stress they might cause, especially given your epilepsy. If you have any specific concerns or if the hickey is causing unusual symptoms (like severe pain or swelling), it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional."

Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several concerning signs that warrant a visit to a healthcare provider. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what to look out for and why:1. Lightheadedness and Fatigue:Possible Causes: These symptoms could be related to a variety of issues, including anemia (iron deficiency), dehydration, hormonal imbalances, or even side effects from your medications (e.g., Lamotrigine). Given your history of iron deficiency, it\u2019s important to rule this out again.Action: Consider getting blood tests to check for anemia, thyroid function, and electrolyte imbalances. Also, discuss with your doctor whether your Lamotrigine dosage needs adjustment.2. Dark Urine:Possible Causes: Dark urine can be a sign of dehydration, liver issues, or even a urinary tract infection (UTI). Given that you drink a lot of water, persistent dark urine is concerning.Action: A urine test can help rule out infections or other issues. Liver function tests might also be warranted.3. Light Periods:Possible Causes: Changes in menstrual flow can be due to hormonal imbalances, stress, or underlying conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid issues. Given your history of endometriosis and an ovarian cyst, this could also be related.Action: A pelvic ultrasound and hormonal panel (including thyroid hormones) could provide more insight.4. Ovarian Pain:Possible Causes: The increase in pain and tenderness around your ovarian cyst could indicate that the cyst has grown, changed, or is causing complications like torsion (twisting) or rupture. While exercise is unlikely to cause a cyst to burst, it can exacerbate pain if the cyst is already irritated.Action: A follow-up ultrasound is crucial to assess the cyst\u2019s size and characteristics. If the pain becomes severe or sudden, seek immediate medical attention as this could indicate torsion or rupture, which are emergencies.5. Flu-like Symptoms and Frequent Colds:Possible Causes: Frequent colds and flu-like symptoms could indicate a weakened immune system, possibly due to stress, nutritional deficiencies, or an underlying condition.Action: Blood tests to check for immune function and nutritional deficiencies (like Vitamin D, B12, and iron) might be helpful.6. Demotivation and Mood Changes:Possible Causes: While this could be related to seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or depression, it\u2019s also worth considering that physical health issues (like hormonal imbalances or chronic pain) can contribute to mood changes.Action: Continue using the therapy lamp and Vitamin D, but also discuss your mood changes with a healthcare provider to rule out underlying physical causes.When to See a Doctor:Immediately: If you experience severe abdominal pain, sudden changes in vision, or any signs of an ovarian cyst rupture (sharp, sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting), seek emergency care.Soon: Schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your symptoms, especially the lightheadedness, dark urine, and ovarian pain. Bring up your concerns about your family history of cancer and request appropriate screenings.Summary:Blood Tests: Check for anemia, thyroid function, liver function, and immune markers.Urine Test: Rule out infections or other issues.Pelvic Ultrasound: Assess the ovarian cyst and any changes.Hormonal Panel: Evaluate for hormonal imbalances affecting your periods and mood.Given your complex medical history and the interplay of symptoms, a thorough evaluation is essential to ensure that nothing serious is being overlooked. It\u2019s better to be proactive, especially with a family history of cancer and the potential for serious complications from your ovarian cyst."

        "question": "I\u2019m (40F) 5ft 8, 164lbs, caucasian. Medications: Lamotrigine and Sertraline Health conditions: ADHD, Tourette\u2019s, epilepsy and severe degenerative disc disease. I don\u2019t have a current issue but every time I\u2019ve had surgery I wake up completely full of beans, even when I\u2019ve just woken up in recovery. I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can\u2019t stop giggling. I don\u2019t feel sick at all and always want water and food immediately. Drs/nurses etc have commented it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even have surgery, but I\u2019ve never asked if there\u2019s a reason why. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I\u2019ve never been told I\u2019m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your experience of waking up from surgery feeling hyperactive, talkative, and pain-free is intriguing, and there are several factors that could contribute to this phenomenon. While I can\u2019t provide a definitive diagnosis, I can offer some insights based on your medical history and the information you\u2019ve shared:1. Medications and Neurological ConditionsLamotrigine and Sertraline: Both of these medications can influence your brain chemistry. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy and mood stabilization, while sertraline is an SSRI used for depression and anxiety. These medications may affect how your body responds to anesthesia and pain management.ADHD and Tourette\u2019s: These conditions involve dysregulation of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which could influence your response to anesthesia and post-surgical arousal. People with ADHD often have atypical responses to stimulants and sedatives, which might explain your heightened alertness after surgery.Epilepsy: Your history of epilepsy means your brain may process medications and anesthesia differently than someone without a seizure disorder. Anesthetic agents can sometimes have paradoxical effects in individuals with neurological conditions.2. Anesthesia and Pain ResponseResistance to Anesthesia: Your mention of needing extra anesthetic at the dentist and your high energy levels post-surgery suggest you may have a higher tolerance for certain anesthetic agents. This could be due to genetic factors, your neurological conditions, or even the medications you\u2019re taking.Codeine Ineffectiveness: Codeine is a prodrug that needs to be metabolized into morphine to be effective. Some people (especially those with certain genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme) don\u2019t metabolize codeine well, rendering it ineffective. This could explain why codeine doesn\u2019t work for you.Post-Surgical Euphoria: The combination of anesthesia, pain relief, and the stress of surgery can sometimes trigger a euphoric response in certain individuals. This might explain your giggling, talkativeness, and lack of pain immediately after surgery.3. Degenerative Disc Disease and Chronic PainYour history of severe degenerative disc disease means you may have a higher baseline tolerance for pain, which could contribute to why you don\u2019t feel surgical pain immediately after the procedure. Chronic pain conditions can alter the way the brain processes acute pain signals.4. Possible Explanations for Your Post-Surgical BehaviorParadoxical Reaction to Anesthesia: Some individuals experience paradoxical reactions to sedatives or anesthesia, leading to hyperactivity or agitation instead of drowsiness.Adrenaline Surge: Surgery is a significant physiological stressor, and your body may release a surge of adrenaline as you wake up, contributing to your hyperactive state.Individual Variability: Everyone responds differently to anesthesia and surgery. Your unique combination of medications, health conditions, and genetics may simply make you more prone to this type of reaction.5. What You Can DoDiscuss with Your Anesthesiologist: Before any future surgeries, share this history with your anesthesiologist. They can tailor your anesthesia plan to account for your unique responses.Genetic Testing: If you\u2019re curious about your resistance to codeine and anesthesia, you might consider genetic testing (e.g., for CYP2D6 enzyme activity) to better understand how your body metabolizes certain medications.Monitor and Report: Keep track of your reactions and share them with your healthcare providers. This information can help them optimize your care in the future.While your post-surgical behavior is unusual, it doesn\u2019t seem to be harmful. However, it\u2019s always a good idea to explore these reactions with your medical team to ensure they\u2019re not indicative of an underlying issue. Your case is a great example of how individual variability can play a significant role in medical experiences!"

        "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this discomfort. Based on what you've described, your symptoms could be related to several potential causes, and it\u2019s important to consider both gastrointestinal and hormonal factors, especially given your medical history and medications. Here are some possibilities to consider:1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)Your symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, feeling like you need to use the bathroom, and stomach gurgling) are consistent with IBS, a common functional gastrointestinal disorder.IBS can be triggered or worsened by stress, anxiety, or dietary factors (e.g., spicy foods, caffeine, or carbonated drinks).The fact that your symptoms improved with dietary changes (avoiding soda and spicy foods) and returned later suggests IBS could be a possibility.2. Medication Side Effects or WithdrawalKeppra (levetiracetam): While Keppra is generally well-tolerated, it can cause gastrointestinal side effects like abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits in some people.Amitriptyline withdrawal: Stopping amitriptyline can cause gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, abdominal discomfort) as part of withdrawal, though these usually resolve within a few weeks.Paracetamol (acetaminophen): Overuse of paracetamol can irritate the stomach lining, but this is less likely if you\u2019re only taking it occasionally for migraines.3. Hormonal InfluencesYour delayed period and irregular cycles could be linked to hormonal fluctuations, which might also affect your gastrointestinal system. For example, progesterone levels can cause bloating, cramping, and changes in bowel habits.Stress and anxiety (which you mentioned) can disrupt your menstrual cycle and exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms.4. Food Intolerances or SensitivitiesCertain foods (e.g., dairy, gluten, or high-FODMAP foods) might trigger abdominal pain, bloating, or the sensation of needing to use the bathroom.Keeping a food diary to track what you eat and how you feel afterward could help identify potential triggers.5. Other Gastrointestinal ConditionsGastritis or Peptic Ulcers: These can cause stomach pain, especially after eating.Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO): This can cause bloating, gurgling, and changes in bowel habits.Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis can cause abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, but these are usually accompanied by other symptoms like blood in the stool or weight loss.What You Can Do:Dietary Adjustments:Continue avoiding spicy foods, sodas, and caffeine.Consider trying a low-FODMAP diet (under the guidance of a dietitian) to see if it helps.Stay hydrated and eat smaller, more frequent meals to reduce strain on your digestive system.Stress Management:Since stress and anxiety seem to worsen your symptoms, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.If anxiety attacks are frequent, consider speaking with a therapist or your doctor about additional support.Track Your Symptoms:Keep a diary of your symptoms, diet, and menstrual cycle to identify patterns or triggers.Medical Evaluation:If the pain persists or worsens, consult your doctor. They may recommend tests like:Blood tests (to check for inflammation, infections, or hormonal imbalances).Stool tests (to rule out infections or malabsorption).Imaging (e.g., ultrasound or endoscopy) if needed.When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention:If you experience severe pain, fever, vomiting, blood in your stool, or unexplained weight loss, seek medical care promptly, as these could indicate a more serious condition.It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve already made some dietary changes and are mindful of your symptoms. However, since this is a recurring issue, it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor to rule out any underlying conditions and ensure your treatment plan is optimized. Take care!"

        "question": "Gender: Female, Age: 9, Height: Idk tbh, Location: Head, How long ago: 1 week.So my co-workers daughter was just diagnosed with grey matter heterotopia. She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren\u2019t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about your co-worker's daughter. It's understandable that this is a very difficult time for her and her family. Grey matter heterotopia (GMH) is a neurological condition where clusters of grey matter (brain cells) are located in the wrong part of the brain, often due to a disruption during fetal development. It can cause seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological symptoms, but the severity varies widely from person to person.Here\u2019s some information that might help provide clarity and hope:What is Grey Matter Heterotopia?GMH is a type of neuronal migration disorder, meaning the brain cells didn\u2019t move to the correct location during early brain development.It\u2019s often diagnosed when someone has seizures or developmental delays, as in your co-worker\u2019s daughter\u2019s case.The condition can be isolated or associated with other genetic or developmental conditions.What Are the Options?While I\u2019m not a doctor, here are some general options that are often considered for managing GMH:Medication for Seizures:Anti-seizure medications (anticonvulsants) are typically the first line of treatment. Many people with GMH respond well to medication and can achieve good seizure control.If one medication doesn\u2019t work, doctors may try others or combinations of medications.Monitoring and Support:Regular follow-ups with a neurologist are important to monitor seizures, development, and overall health.Early intervention programs (speech therapy, occupational therapy, etc.) can help address developmental delays if they arise.Surgical Options (in some cases):If seizures are not controlled with medication and are significantly impacting quality of life, surgery might be considered. This could involve removing or disconnecting the abnormal brain tissue causing the seizures.However, surgery is only an option if the heterotopia is in a location that can be safely accessed.Genetic Testing:In some cases, genetic testing may be recommended to determine if the GMH is linked to a specific genetic condition. This can help guide treatment and provide information about the prognosis.Lifestyle and Support:A healthy lifestyle, including proper sleep, stress management, and avoiding seizure triggers, can help manage symptoms.Support groups for families dealing with epilepsy or neurological disorders can provide emotional support and practical advice.What Can You Do to Help?Offer Emotional Support: Your co-worker is likely feeling overwhelmed. Simply being there to listen and offer comfort can mean a lot.Share Reliable Resources: Point her to reputable organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) or Child Neurology Foundation (childneurologyfoundation.org) for more information and support.Help Brighten Their Day: Small gestures, like bringing her a coffee, offering to help with tasks, or even sharing a funny story, can make a big difference during a tough time.Reasons for HopeMany children with GMH lead full, happy lives with proper treatment and support.Advances in neurology and epilepsy treatment mean there are more options than ever before.Early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes.It\u2019s great that you\u2019re looking for ways to support your co-worker and her daughter. Even if the news feels overwhelming, knowing they have a supportive community around them can make a huge difference. Let them know they\u2019re not alone, and encourage them to take things one step at a time. Wishing them all the best as they navigate this journey."

After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens.

Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",

        "answer": "The sensations you're describing\u2014intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu followed by disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and confusion\u2014are not typical of ordinary d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and could potentially be related to a neurological phenomenon. Given your medical history (asthma, medications, and cannabis use) and the specific nature of these episodes, it\u2019s worth considering a few possibilities:1. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) or Focal SeizuresThe symptoms you describe (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and confusion) are classic features of focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures), which often originate in the temporal lobe. These seizures can occur without loss of consciousness and may be followed by a postictal period (the weird feeling afterward).Temporal lobe epilepsy is often associated with vivid dreams, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and intense emotional or sensory experiences.The fact that you could sometimes control the progression of these sensations as a child might suggest a neurological origin, as some people with focal seizures report being able to interrupt or modify their experience during the aura phase.Next Steps:Consider discussing these symptoms with a neurologist. They may recommend an electroencephalogram (EEG) to check for abnormal electrical activity in the brain, particularly in the temporal lobe.Keeping a detailed diary of these episodes (frequency, triggers, duration, and symptoms) can help with diagnosis.2. Medication Side Effects or InteractionsYour current medications (Wellbutrin SR, Vyvanse, Lexapro, montelukast, and spironolactone) are generally well-tolerated, but some can cause dizziness, confusion, or neurological symptoms in certain individuals.Wellbutrin (bupropion): Can lower the seizure threshold, especially in individuals with a predisposition to seizures.Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine): A stimulant that can cause dizziness, confusion, or anxiety in some people.Lexapro (escitalopram): Rarely, SSRIs can cause neurological symptoms like dizziness or confusion.Cannabis use: While cannabis is not typically associated with seizures, it can cause derealization, dizziness, or disorientation in some individuals, especially with frequent use.Next Steps:Review your medications and cannabis use with your prescribing doctor or psychiatrist to rule out any potential interactions or side effects.3. Derealization or DepersonalizationThe sensations you describe (feeling weird, disoriented, or overwhelmed) could also align with derealization (feeling detached from your surroundings) or depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself). These can occur due to anxiety, stress, or even as a side effect of medications or cannabis use.However, the intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the specific progression of symptoms make this less likely as the primary explanation.4. Migraine with AuraSome people experience neurological symptoms (e.g., d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, dizziness, confusion, or nausea) as part of a migraine aura, even without a headache. These symptoms can last for minutes to hours and may be followed by a postdrome phase (feeling off afterward).Next Steps:If you have a history of migraines or other migraine-like symptoms (e.g., visual disturbances, sensitivity to light or sound), this could be worth exploring with a doctor.5. Psychological FactorsStress, anxiety, or trauma can sometimes manifest as physical or neurological symptoms, including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, dizziness, or disorientation. However, the episodic and stereotyped nature of your symptoms suggests a more physiological cause.Recommendations:Consult a Neurologist: Given the episodic and stereotyped nature of your symptoms, a neurological evaluation is important to rule out focal seizures or other brain-related issues.Keep a Symptom Diary: Document the frequency, triggers, duration, and specifics of each episode to help your doctor identify patterns.Review Medications and Cannabis Use: Discuss your current medications and cannabis use with your doctor to rule out any potential contributors.Consider an EEG or MRI: If your doctor suspects seizures or another neurological condition, they may recommend imaging or an EEG to assess brain activity.Final Thoughts:While d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a common experience, the additional symptoms you describe (disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and confusion) are not typical and warrant further investigation. Temporal lobe epilepsy or focal seizures are a strong possibility, but other causes (e.g., medication side effects, migraines) should also be explored. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re paying attention to these symptoms\u2014early evaluation can help identify the cause and ensure appropriate management."

        "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible that your symptoms could be related to your GERD, hiatal hernia, or even the long-term use of PPIs, though the connection isn't entirely straightforward. Let\u2019s break this down:1. Hiatal Hernia and GERDA hiatal hernia can irritate the vagus nerve, which runs near the diaphragm and esophagus. The vagus nerve plays a key role in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.Weightlifting or intense exercise can increase intra-abdominal pressure, which might exacerbate a hiatal hernia and potentially stimulate the vagus nerve. This could lead to a phenomenon called vasovagal syncope, where the vagus nerve overreacts, causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to lightheadedness or fainting.2. Vagus Nerve and ExerciseThe vagus nerve can be sensitive to mechanical pressure or irritation, especially during activities like weightlifting that increase abdominal pressure. This could trigger a vasovagal response, causing dizziness or fainting.Additionally, straining during heavy lifting can cause a temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain (similar to the Valsalva maneuver), which might contribute to lightheadedness or passing out.3. PPIs and Potential Side EffectsLong-term PPI use has been associated with certain side effects, including magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia), which can cause muscle weakness, irregular heart rhythms, and even seizures in severe cases. Low magnesium levels could theoretically contribute to your symptoms, especially after exercise when electrolyte imbalances might be more pronounced.PPIs can also affect nutrient absorption (e.g., vitamin B12, iron), which could indirectly contribute to fatigue or neurological symptoms.4. Seizure-like EpisodesIf your episodes involve loss of consciousness with jerking movements, it\u2019s possible they could be mistaken for seizures. However, vasovagal syncope can sometimes cause brief convulsive movements, which might be confused with epilepsy.The fact that these episodes occur specifically after workouts suggests a potential link to physical exertion rather than a primary neurological condition like epilepsy.5. Next StepsReevaluate GERD and Hiatal Hernia: Discuss with your gastroenterologist whether your hiatal hernia could be contributing to vagus nerve irritation, especially during exercise. They might recommend further imaging or tests to assess the hernia\u2019s size and impact.Electrolyte and Nutrient Levels: Ask your doctor to check your magnesium, calcium, potassium, and vitamin B12 levels, as deficiencies could contribute to your symptoms.Monitor Exercise Intensity: Consider modifying your workout routine to avoid excessive straining or heavy lifting. Focus on exercises that don\u2019t dramatically increase intra-abdominal pressure.Vagus Nerve Evaluation: If vasovagal syncope is suspected, a cardiologist or neurologist might recommend additional tests, such as a Valsalva maneuver test or autonomic nervous system evaluation.6. Lifestyle AdjustmentsAvoid heavy meals before working out, as this can increase intra-abdominal pressure and exacerbate GERD.Stay hydrated and ensure adequate electrolyte intake, especially if you sweat heavily during exercise.Consider working with a physical therapist or trainer to adjust your weightlifting technique to minimize strain on your diaphragm and abdomen.ConclusionWhile the exact cause of your episodes isn\u2019t clear, the connection to exercise and your history of GERD and hiatal hernia suggests that vagus nerve irritation or vasovagal syncope could be playing a role. It\u2019s worth exploring this possibility further with your healthcare team, particularly focusing on the interplay between your hernia, GERD, and exercise."

        "question": "29F, height 165cm, weight 74kg, caucasian. I do not smoke or have regular dairy. Weekly alcohol consumption would be 2-7 standard drinks per week at most.  also regularly have lean meat and 3 veg for lunch and dinner and a fruit smoothie for breakfast. Current diagnoses: epilepsy, mild chronic pancreatitis Regular medications are: AM: 500mg Kepra, vitamins D+magnesium PM: 500mg Kepra, vitamin D+magnesium I am awaiting follow-up with a gastroenterologist about why my pancreas could be nibbling on itself (lypase has been found to be between 70-100 on multiple occasions). I have a history of treating my anxiety with alcohol and fast food but over the last 8 years or so (since my early 20's) I've gone to therapy and gotten it really well under control. I never had these symptoms before when I had unhealthy habits but over the last year my pancreas has not been having a good time. Every month or 2 I get these very specific pains that I now know is mild chronic pancreatitis. It's never brought on by a change in routine, it's always random.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you're managing several health conditions, including epilepsy and mild chronic pancreatitis, while maintaining a generally healthy lifestyle. Here are some key points and considerations based on the information you've provided:1. Chronic PancreatitisSymptoms: The recurring pain you describe is consistent with chronic pancreatitis. The randomness of the pain episodes, despite a stable routine, suggests that the condition may be influenced by factors other than diet or lifestyle, such as underlying anatomical or metabolic issues.Lipase Levels: Elevated lipase levels (70-100 U/L) indicate pancreatic inflammation. While your levels are not extremely high, they are above the normal range (typically 10-60 U/L), which warrants further investigation.Follow-Up: It\u2019s good that you\u2019re awaiting a follow-up with a gastroenterologist. They may recommend additional tests, such as imaging (CT, MRI, or endoscopic ultrasound) to assess the structure of your pancreas and rule out other causes like gallstones, autoimmune pancreatitis, or genetic factors.2. Epilepsy and MedicationsKeppra (Levetiracetam): You\u2019re on a standard dose of Keppra, which is effective for managing epilepsy. Ensure you stay consistent with your medication, as missed doses can increase the risk of seizures.Vitamin D and Magnesium: These supplements are beneficial, especially since vitamin D deficiency is common and magnesium can help with nerve function and muscle relaxation. However, excessive magnesium can sometimes cause gastrointestinal issues, so ensure you\u2019re not exceeding recommended doses.3. Diet and LifestyleAlcohol: Your current alcohol intake (2-7 standard drinks per week) is relatively low, but even moderate alcohol consumption can exacerbate pancreatitis. Consider reducing or eliminating alcohol entirely to see if it improves your symptoms.Diet: Your diet sounds balanced, with lean meat, vegetables, and fruit smoothies. However, for pancreatitis, a low-fat diet is often recommended to reduce the workload on the pancreas. You might consider reducing fat intake further and focusing on easily digestible foods.Hydration: Ensure you\u2019re staying well-hydrated, as dehydration can worsen pancreatic issues.4. Anxiety and Mental HealthIt\u2019s great that you\u2019ve made significant progress in managing your anxiety through therapy. Stress and anxiety can indirectly affect physical health, so continuing to prioritize mental health is important.5. Next StepsGastroenterologist Consultation: Be prepared to discuss your symptoms, diet, alcohol intake, and any family history of pancreatic or gastrointestinal issues. They may order additional tests or suggest dietary modifications.Pain Management: If the pain becomes more frequent or severe, ask your doctor about safe pain management options that won\u2019t interfere with your epilepsy or pancreatitis.Monitor Symptoms: Keep a symptom diary to track pain episodes, diet, alcohol intake, and any potential triggers. This can help identify patterns and guide treatment.6. Potential Red FlagsIf you experience severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), seek immediate medical attention, as these could indicate a more serious pancreatic issue.Overall, you\u2019re taking many positive steps to manage your health. The upcoming gastroenterologist appointment should provide more clarity and help tailor a plan to address your pancreatitis. In the meantime, continue to prioritize a healthy lifestyle and avoid potential triggers like alcohol and high-fat foods."
