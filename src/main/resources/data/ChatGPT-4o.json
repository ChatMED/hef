        "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you have been through a lot with all the tests and doctor visits. It's great that they have ruled out epilepsy as a cause for your seizures. It's possible that the dizziness and disorientation you are feeling while playing games could be related to eyestrain, as your neurologist mentioned.\n\nHere are a few tips that might help:\n1. Take regular breaks while playing games to rest your eyes and prevent eyestrain.\n2. Make sure you are sitting in a well-lit room and adjust the brightness of your screen to a comfortable level.\n3. Stay hydrated and take care of your overall health, as anxiety and dissociation can also contribute to feelings of dizziness and disorientation.\n4. Consider speaking to a therapist or counselor about your anxiety and dissociation issues. They may be able to provide you with coping mechanisms and support.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to follow up with your neurologist or seek a second opinion from a different doctor. It's always better to be cautious when it comes to your health."

        "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your description of the events and the medical tests that have been performed, it is possible that you may have epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures can manifest in different ways, including loss of consciousness, confusion, and uncontrolled movements.\n\nThe fact that you have experienced two episodes of sudden collapse and confusion in a relatively short period of time, despite having no previous history of seizures or medical conditions, raises the possibility of epilepsy. Additionally, the fact that you have experienced several potential triggers for seizures before and after these episodes further supports the possibility of epilepsy.\n\nThe fact that your neurologist has prescribed you Lamotrigine, an antiepileptic medication, also suggests that they suspect epilepsy as the underlying cause of your episodes.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your neurologist and continue taking your medication as prescribed. They may recommend further tests or adjustments to your treatment plan to better manage your condition. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to speak with your healthcare provider."

        "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is true that epilepsy is typically diagnosed after a person has had at least two unprovoked seizures. However, in some cases, a diagnosis of epilepsy may be made after just one seizure if the EEG results show abnormal electrical activity in the brain that is consistent with epilepsy.\n\nAn EEG is a test that measures the electrical activity in the brain. In people with epilepsy, the EEG often shows abnormal patterns of electrical activity, such as spikes or sharp waves. These abnormal patterns can help doctors determine if a person has epilepsy or another neurological condition.\n\nIt is important to discuss your concerns and questions with your husband's neurologist. It is possible that there may have been other factors or evidence that led the neurologist to diagnose epilepsy after just one seizure and abnormal EEG results. It is also important to get clarification on the specific findings from the EEG and how they relate to the diagnosis of epilepsy.\n\nIf you are still unsure about the diagnosis, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from another neurologist or epilepsy specialist. They can review your husband's test results and provide further insight into the diagnosis.\n\nOverall, it is important to gather as much information as possible and work closely with your husband's healthcare team to ensure he receives the most appropriate care and treatment for his condition."

        "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nIt is possible that the plasma donation center turned you away due to concerns about the potential risk of seizure activity during or after the donation process. While donating plasma itself does not typically pose a significant risk to individuals with epilepsy, there may be concerns about potential stress or changes in blood pressure that could trigger a seizure in some cases.\n\nIt is important to discuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider, who can provide more personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status. They may be able to provide more information about whether or not plasma donation is safe for you, and if there are any specific precautions you should take if you choose to donate.\n\nOverall, it is important for individuals with epilepsy to prioritize their health and well-being, and to work closely with their healthcare team to make informed decisions about activities that may have an impact on their condition."

        "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I\u2019ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I\u2019m seeing that I haven\u2019t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I\u2019m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I\u2019d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it\u2019s important to me to know when it\u2019s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's always important to be honest on medical forms, as it can impact the care you receive and the treatments that may be recommended for you. In your case, since you had surgery to remove the gliosis and part of your right hippocampus, and have been seizure-free since then, your history of epilepsy may not be relevant to your current health. However, it's still good to disclose this information to new healthcare providers just in case it might impact any potential treatments or medications in the future. If you're ever unsure about whether to disclose your history of epilepsy, it's always best to err on the side of caution and mention it to your healthcare provider."

        "question": "My partner (20M) has been having these \u2018seizure-like\u2019 behaviours for as long as he can remember (so assuming his whole life). There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The second part of his behaviour is less frequent, maybe once a week or less. These are more serious and resemble seizures. He will completely lose control of his body, falling to the ground, shaking and convulsing for around 1-2 minutes. He will be unresponsive during this time and will often come round with no memory of what has happened. These episodes seem to have more of a trigger, such as being overly stressed or overwhelmed.\n\nI am really concerned for his health and well-being, and I think it's important that he sees a doctor or neurologist as soon as possible. These behaviours could be indicative of a neurological condition such as epilepsy, or they could be a result of stress or other underlying issues. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan in place to help manage and improve his symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to support and reassure him, and try to create a safe environment for him to prevent any injuries during his episodes. Encourage him to keep a journal of when these behaviours occur, any triggers or patterns he notices, and any other symptoms he may be experiencing. This information can be really helpful for the doctor in determining the cause of his symptoms.\n\nOverall, it's important to take these behaviours seriously and seek medical help.

I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out.

I don\u2019t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it\u2019s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It\u2019s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn\u2019t the same feeling. I\u2019ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn\u2019t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area. At night when I try to sleep it sometimes it feels like my eyes and brain are about to move side to side\u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a box and someone is shaking it diagonally. Makes me dizzy as all hell and my body feels it too. That has happened a handful of times in my life in the past and I went years without it happening and it\u2019s back, and it\u2019s scary and feels horrible. Shaking my head hard helps stop it when I feel it coming on.Does what I\u2019m experiencing sound like focal seizure/epilepsy? I\u2019m really nervous about this. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s all because of the trazodone or if I had this since I was a kid (since I\u2019ve experienced that weird shaking in a box sensation multiple times through my life) and the trazodone made it all come to the surface?Meds I take: klonopin 1mg, vitamin d, probiotic, melatonin 2mg, trazodone 25mg.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is possible that what you are experiencing could be related to focal seizures or epilepsy, especially since you have a history of the sensation of shaking in a box. It is important to speak with your healthcare provider about these symptoms to determine if further evaluation or testing is needed. The medications you are taking, specifically trazodone, could potentially be contributing to or exacerbating these symptoms, so it is important to discuss this with your healthcare provider as well. They will be able to provide you with the necessary advice and guidance on how to best manage your symptoms."

        "answer": "It is possible that the neurologist used the term \"essentially normal\" to indicate that while there were no significant abnormalities detected on the EEG, there may have been some minor or subtle findings that are not considered clinically significant. This could also be used to convey that although the EEG did not show any clear abnormalities that would definitively point to epilepsy, there may still be some uncertainty or ambiguity in the diagnosis due to the complex nature of the presentations and symptoms experienced by the individual.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is likely that the reason individuals with epilepsy are not allowed to donate plasma or blood is due to the potential risk of having a seizure during the donation process. Seizures can be unpredictable and can pose a danger to both the donor and the staff administering the donation. Additionally, the medications you are taking for your epilepsy may also be a factor in the restriction, as they could potentially impact the quality or safety of the donated plasma.\n\nIf you are interested in donating plasma despite being epileptic, it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider or the donation center directly to discuss your specific situation and see if there are any possible accommodations that can be made. They may be able to provide more information on the reasons behind the restriction and any potential alternatives."

She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",

        "answer": "It sounds like your friend is going through a scary and difficult time, and it's important for her to continue to work with her healthcare providers to determine the cause of these episodes. It's good that her magnesium levels were low, as this can sometimes lead to seizures, confusion, and dizziness. Ensuring she is taking any prescribed supplements and following up with her doctors regularly is crucial.\n\nIn the meantime, it might be helpful for her to keep a detailed diary of her episodes, including the times they occur, any symptoms she experiences before and after, and any potential triggers or patterns she notices. This information can be valuable for her healthcare providers in identifying potential causes or contributing factors.\n\nEncourage her to prioritize self-care and rest, to stay hydrated, and to follow any other recommendations or treatments her healthcare providers have suggested.

Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is possible for lesions in the brain to shrink over time, as the brain has the ability to repair and regenerate itself to some extent. However, the presence of a lesion itself does not necessarily guarantee the occurrence of seizures. Seizures can be caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to brain lesions.\n\nGiven your history of substance abuse and subsequent psychosis, it is important to continue taking your medications as prescribed to manage your seizures. Abruptly stopping or missing doses of your medications can increase the risk of seizures. It is essential to follow up with your neurologist regularly to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nIf you have concerns about your current medication regimen or the presence of a shrinking lesion in your brain, it is recommended that you discuss these with your healthcare provider for a better understanding of your specific situation."

        "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying.

All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's difficult to say exactly what could be causing these episodes without more information and a complete medical evaluation. Passing out or having seizures after eating certain foods, like ice cream, can sometimes be related to specific allergies, sensitivities, or medical conditions. It's possible that your niece could be having a reaction to something in the ice cream, such as a food allergy or sensitivity.\n\nIt's also possible that the passing out episodes could be related to a neurological condition or other underlying health issue.

        "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",

        "answer": "It's great that you sought multiple opinions and went through various tests to try and figure out the cause of your episodes. It's always important to listen to your body and take precautions to prevent further episodes.\n\nGiven your history of GERD and a hiatal hernia, it's possible that there could be a connection between your symptoms and the pressure or strain placed on the vagus nerve during certain activities like pull-ups. The vagus nerve plays a role in regulating heart rate and blood pressure, so it's possible that the pressure from lifting weights could have triggered a response in your body leading to light-headedness and fainting.\n\nIt's also important to consider the potential effects of PPIs on nutrient absorption and overall health. PPIs can reduce the production of stomach acid, which can impact the absorption of certain nutrients like magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12. This could potentially contribute to symptoms of light-headedness or weakness.\n\nUltimately, it's important to continue working closely with your healthcare provider to monitor your symptoms and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. It's also important to continue following their advice to avoid activities that may trigger your symptoms and prioritize your overall health and well-being.\n\nIf you ever experience any new or concerning symptoms, be sure to reach out to your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance.

Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans.

        "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",

        "answer": "First of all, I want to commend you for reaching out for help and being honest about your substance use. It's important to understand that seeking medical advice is crucial in these situations, regardless of the circumstances that led to your symptoms.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is possible that the combination of substances you consumed, particularly the fluoxetine and alcohol, may have contributed to the symptoms you are experiencing. Myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" are often associated with SSRI discontinuation syndrome, which can occur when stopping or reducing the dosage of certain medications, including fluoxetine.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that seizures are not typically characterized by twitching episodes that occur when you are sitting or lying down. However, it is important to rule out any underlying neurological conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Given the persistent nature of your symptoms, I highly recommend seeking medical attention to undergo a thorough evaluation, including a neurological assessment and potentially an EEG to assess brain activity.\n\nIt is possible that your symptoms may gradually improve over time, but it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management plan.

What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information based on common knowledge.\n\nThe general cause of epilepsy can vary, but it is often due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It can be caused by genetics, brain injury, infections, or other medical conditions.\n\nTo ensure a speedy cure or preventions, it is important for your sister to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed by her doctor. It is also important for her to follow a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding triggers that may worsen her symptoms.\n\nWhen your sister is having an episode of epilepsy during sleep, it is important to stay calm and try to keep her safe by moving any nearby objects that she could potentially injure herself on. It may also be helpful to record the duration and symptoms of the episode to share with her doctor.\n\nTo reduce the risk of serious injuries from epilepsy, it is important for your sister to avoid activities that could put her at risk, such as swimming alone or standing near open flames. It may also be helpful for her to wear a medical alert bracelet so that others are aware of her condition in case of an emergency."

        "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": " It is possible that the weakness and trembling in your left shoulder and arm could be a result of hemiparesis, which is a condition that involves weakness on one side of the body. This condition can sometimes be a result of brain surgery, especially if the surgery was on the right side of the brain.\n\nIt is important to discuss your concerns with your neurologist or a physical therapist who can evaluate your strength and range of motion in your left shoulder and arm. They can provide you with a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options. This may include physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in your left shoulder and arm or other interventions to improve your strength and function.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard with weightlifting exercises that exacerbate your symptoms. It may be helpful to focus on lower weight and higher repetition exercises that target your left shoulder and arm to gradually build strength and stability.\n\nOverall, it is important to work closely with healthcare professionals to address your concerns and come up with a plan to improve your strength and function in your left shoulder and arm."

I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m not sure if they are related and I really don\u2019t know which road to go down.I\u2019ve had ruptured ovarian cysts consistently since I was 12. every time I ovulate. I\u2019ve been on birth control since I was 13 because of that. I have insanely painful periods and I know my hormones are out of wack but I\u2019ve never been diagnosed officially with PCOS or endometriosis but I think I could have either one. not sure.I got diagnosed with epilepsy last February after two grand mal seizures on the same day. coincidentally(?) I had just gotten off birth control to try and heal my body naturally. my seizures seem to align with my menstrual cycle. I\u2019m on Keppra and it\u2019s controlling my tonic clonic seizures but I have breakthrough absence seizures 3x a week. originally my first EEG only showed right temporal lobe seizures but my most recent EEG showed right and left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe seizures.while I was in the epilepsy monitoring unit last week for a 7 day EEG during a pretty intense grand mal seizure my heart rate hit 275 bpm. I\u2019ve always felt little heart flutters but this was intense. I have a Holter monitor now, and I was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. I\u2019m getting an ablation next week. the flutters happen after every seizure but sometimes just on their own without seizure activity.can someone please help me connect the dots, or point me in the direction of someone who can help? I\u2019m really up for any suggestions right now because I want to go back to my normal life. thank you!",

It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot and it's important to get to the bottom of what's going on.\n\nGiven the complexity of your medical history, it may be helpful to see a specialist who can help you connect the dots between your various conditions. A reproductive endocrinologist or a gynecologist who specializes in fertility issues may be able to provide insight into your ovarian cysts, painful periods, and potential hormonal imbalances.\n\nIn terms of your epilepsy, it's concerning that you are still experiencing breakthrough seizures despite being on medication. It may be beneficial to see an epilepsy specialist or neurologist who can further evaluate your seizure activity and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\nRegarding your supraventricular tachycardia, it's good that you are scheduled for an ablation procedure. This should hopefully help address the issue of your rapid heart rate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to work with a healthcare provider who can take a holistic approach to your care and look at how all of your conditions may be interconnected. Integrative medicine practitioners or functional medicine doctors may be able to help you address the underlying causes of your health issues and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\nOverall, it's important to advocate for yourself and seek out medical professionals who can help you navigate your complex medical history. Don't hesitate to seek second opinions or ask for referrals to specialists who may be able to provide further insight and support.

        "answer": "Mild cerebral hypoxia occurs when there is a slight decrease in the amount of oxygen reaching the brain, which can affect brain function and overall health. While severe cerebral hypoxia can be very serious and potentially life-threatening, mild cerebral hypoxia may not cause immediate or severe consequences.\n\nHowever, the fact that you are experiencing episodes of spasms and staring multiple times a day, along with abnormal brain waves indicating possible mild cerebral hypoxia, may be a cause for concern. It is important to work closely with your healthcare providers to monitor your symptoms and investigate further to determine the cause of these episodes.\n\nSeeing a cardiology specialist is a good step to take, as they may be able to investigate any potential heart-related issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. It is also important to continue ongoing monitoring and follow-up with your healthcare team to address any concerns and ensure appropriate management of your health.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to take regular breaks from sitting, especially when looking at a screen, to prevent potential triggers for your episodes. Make sure to stay hydrated, get regular exercise, and maintain a healthy lifestyle to support overall brain health.\n\nIf you have any concerns or notice any changes in your symptoms, be sure to contact your healthcare provider for further guidance and support."

Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs.

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your epilepsy and cancer journey. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider before considering taking psychedelics, especially if you have a history of epilepsy. \n\nSome research suggests that psychedelics may lower the seizure threshold in individuals with epilepsy, potentially increasing the risk of seizures. However, there is limited research on this topic, and individual responses to psychedelics can vary. \n\nIn terms of dose, some individuals report experiencing seizures with microdosing but not with higher doses. This could be due to the varying effects of different doses on the brain and neurotransmitter systems.

The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel...

These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening.

        "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Hello! I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've been facing with your epilepsy. It can definitely be frustrating not having a clear cause or solution. Have you considered getting a second opinion from another neurologist or seeking out a specialist in epilepsy treatment? They may be able to offer you different perspectives or treatment options that your current doctor hasn't considered.\n\nIn addition, it might be helpful to explore lifestyle changes that could potentially help manage your epilepsy, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding triggers like alcohol or stress, and keeping a seizure diary to track patterns and potential triggers.\n\nIt's also important to make sure you have a support system in place, whether it's friends, family, or a support group for people with epilepsy. It can be comforting to talk to others who understand what you're going through.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you have concerns or questions about your treatment or any new symptoms. They may be able to adjust your medication or suggest additional strategies to help manage your epilepsy.\n\nTake care and best of luck on your journey towards better health!"

        "question": "22F, 5\u20195, 173lb, whitehi there! weird thing happened last night and i\u2019m nervous and hoping someone might have some input for me. i recently started taking prozac (10mg) in conjunction with lamictal (125mg) (which i\u2019ve been on for about 6 weeks) for MDD. i\u2019ve had a huge decrease in appetite which has led to me forgetting to eat a lot. yesterday i ate very little - almost nothing, without realizing. i was smoking weed with my partner and i started to feel really unwell. i have a low tolerance so i didn\u2019t think much of it. i remember telling him i wanted to lay down, and next thing i knew i woke up to him holding me and saying my name over and over. he asked me a bunch of questions about my surroundings and personal information (address, birthday, etc.) to make sure i was aware and coherent. he said i was sitting there, mentioned i wanted to lay down, and then my body stiffened/seized up and i slid down the chair backwards until i was on the floor and he started trying to wake me up. he said in total, i was out for less than a minute, but he was worried i was having a seizure. while i was out, i was having what felt like a short lucid dream where i was rolling down a mountain, if that\u2019s important. when i came back to my senses, i was sweating a lot, and was nauseous. i laid on the floor for a little bit until i felt okay, and then went to bed. today i feel fine.i figured i just fainted bc i hadn\u2019t eaten and i was smoking, but i know serotonin syndrome can cause seizures so i\u2019m just feeling very anxious and wondering if i\u2019m worrying over nothing. i\u2019ve never fainted or had a seizure so i don\u2019t really know what either one feel like.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's definitely understandable that you're feeling anxious about what happened. It's possible that not eating and smoking weed could have contributed to you fainting, as both can lower blood pressure and affect your overall well-being. It's also important to consider the medications you're taking, as both Prozac and Lamictal can have side effects, including potentially causing seizures.\n\nGiven that you have never fainted or had a seizure before, it's important to discuss this episode with your healthcare provider. They can help determine if it was related to your medication or if it was more likely due to the combination of factors such as not eating and smoking weed. They may also want to adjust your medication dosage or schedule to prevent this from happening again.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to make sure you are eating regularly, especially when taking medications that can affect your appetite. If you continue to feel anxious or have any concerns about your health, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider for guidance."

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your struggles with epilepsy and the difficulties you've faced with medication changes. It sounds like there may have been some miscommunication or misunderstanding with your healthcare providers regarding your seizure types and medication management.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to need adjustments to their medications over time, as seizures can be unpredictable and sometimes require different approaches to control. It's possible that the lower dose of Lamotrigine and the switch from Keppra to Lamotrigine may not have been effective in managing your seizures, leading to the increase in seizure activity.\n\nI would recommend speaking with your neurologist about your recent experiences and concerns. It's important to work closely with your healthcare team to find the most effective medication regimen for you and to address any ongoing seizure activity.\n\nIt's also important to remember that managing epilepsy can be a process of trial and error, and it may take some time to find the right combination of medications that work best for you. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek additional medical opinions or support if needed.\n\nI hope things improve for you soon and that you are able to find a treatment plan that helps you better manage your epilepsy. Take care."

        "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",

        "answer": "I'm glad to hear that you are taking your health seriously and seeking medical attention after experiencing a seizure. Seizures can be caused by a variety of factors, not just epilepsy. It's important to follow up with your neurologist and continue with any recommended testing to determine the underlying cause of your seizure. \n\nAs for returning to your hobbies, it's always best to follow your doctor's recommendations. Depending on the cause of your seizure, it may be advisable to avoid activities that could potentially trigger another seizure, such as high-stress situations or activities that require intense focus and coordination. Your doctor will be able to provide you with specific guidance on when it's safe to resume your normal activities.\n\nIn the meantime, focus on taking care of yourself, getting plenty of rest, and staying hydrated. It's also important to prioritize your mental health during this time and reach out for support if needed.

        "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Anxiety and stress, in and of themselves, are not known to directly cause epilepsy or seizures. However, it is possible for individuals who are not predisposed to epilepsy or seizures to experience seizure-like symptoms as a result of extreme stress or anxiety. This phenomenon is known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or pseudo-seizures.\n\nPNES are psychological events that can closely resemble epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are thought to be a physical manifestation of emotional distress or trauma. It is important to note that although PNES are not caused by epilepsy, they are a serious condition that can greatly impact a person's quality of life and mental health.\n\nIf you are experiencing seizure-like symptoms, it is important to seek medical evaluation and treatment from a healthcare professional. They can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate care and support. It is also important to manage stress and anxiety through healthy coping mechanisms, such as therapy, relaxation techniques, exercise, and social support."

        "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

        "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given that your son has had a recent tonic-clonic seizure and is experiencing absent moments, it is understandable that you are feeling anxious about your upcoming trip to a remote location. It would be wise to prioritize your son's health and safety, especially since you are still awaiting a diagnosis and treatment options.\n\nIt may be best to cancel or postpone your trip until you have more information and guidance from the paediatrician. Seizures can be unpredictable and it is important to have access to medical assistance in case of an emergency. Being in a remote location with limited medical facilities could pose a risk to your son's health.\n\nWhile waiting for the paediatrician appointment, you can also take some steps to ensure your son's safety, such as avoiding activities that could trigger a seizure (e.g. lack of sleep, stress) and making sure he is not left alone in potentially dangerous situations.\n\nUltimately, the decision to cancel or proceed with your trip should be based on what you feel is best for your son's health and well-being. It may also be helpful to discuss your concerns with the paediatrician once you have the appointment."

        "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The next steps for you may involve further testing to determine the cause of the blood in your urine. Some possibilities could include a kidney stone, urinary tract infection, kidney disease, or other underlying health issues. Your doctor may recommend additional tests such as a kidney ultrasound, CT scan, or cystoscopy to further investigate the issue. It's important to follow up with your doctor as soon as possible to discuss these results and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and monitor for any new symptoms that may arise."

        "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is possible that your symptoms could be related to epilepsy, especially given your family history and the fact that you had a negative test for epilepsy when you were younger. However, there could be other explanations for your symptoms as well.\n\nGiven that you experienced shaking, vomiting, dizziness, coldness, and numbness after being exposed to bright and fast lights, it may be worth speaking with a doctor or neurologist about the possibility of photosensitive epilepsy. Photosensitive epilepsy is a form of epilepsy that is triggered by certain visual stimuli, such as flashing lights.\n\nIt's also worth considering other potential causes of your symptoms, such as a migraine or a reaction to the bright lights. Your hormone problems could also potentially be a factor.\n\nIt's important to seek medical advice if you continue to experience these symptoms, or if they worsen. A doctor will be able to evaluate your symptoms, perform any necessary tests, and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "First and foremost, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider about your concerns and the potential treatment options available to you. It sounds like your Chiari 1 malformation and associated symptoms are causing significant challenges in your daily life.\n\nAs for your questions:\n1. It's difficult to predict the lifespan of individuals with uncontrolled seizures, as it can vary depending on various factors. However, managing your seizures and seeking appropriate medical care can help improve your quality of life and potentially extend your lifespan.\n\n2. Spinal decompression surgery may be an option to relieve symptoms related to your Chiari 1 malformation and syrinx. Be sure to discuss the risks and benefits of this procedure with your healthcare provider to determine if it's the right choice for you.\n\n3. There is some evidence that surgery to correct Chiari malformations can help improve seizure control in some cases. Again, this is something you should discuss with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for you.\n\n4. SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is a rare but serious risk for individuals with epilepsy, particularly those with uncontrolled seizures. It's important to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your seizures and reduce your risk of SUDEP.\n\n5. In terms of what to do now, continue to prioritize your health and well-being by seeking medical care, following your treatment plan, and staying connected with your healthcare provider. It's also important to take care of your mental health during this challenging time, so consider reaching out for support from a therapist or counselor.\n\nRemember that you are not alone in facing these challenges, and there are resources and support available to help you navigate your healthcare journey. Take things one step at a time and focus on taking care of yourself."

        "answer": "First of all, I want to commend you for being proactive and concerned about your mom's health. It's important to be aware of any changes in her memory and seek out information and support.\n\nAlthough there may not be a direct correlation between tonic-clonic seizures and memory decline, it's still possible for epilepsy to impact cognitive function. Seizures can affect the brain in various ways, depending on the type and frequency of seizures. It's possible that the repeated seizure activity over the years has had an impact on your mom's temporal lobe, which could potentially contribute to memory issues.\n\nIt's important to have your mom evaluated by a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy. They can conduct tests such as EEGs, MRIs, and cognitive assessments to better understand the extent of any cognitive impairment and determine the best course of action.\n\nIn terms of how to make your mom feel loved and comfortable, it's important to be patient, understanding, and supportive. Encourage her to continue with her medication and treatment plan, and try to create a calm and stress-free environment for her. It might also be helpful to create routines and reminders to help with memory tasks.\n\nWhile it's natural to have concerns and questions, try to take things one step at a time and focus on supporting your mom and advocating for her well-being. Remember that you're not alone, and there are resources and support groups available for caregivers of individuals with epilepsy and cognitive issues.

He diagnosed me with absence seizures but the problem is I\u2019ve never forgotten a seizure or lost consciousness. Now I\u2019m realising that what he\u2019s called my \u2018motor tics\u2019 could be seizures as well. Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I\u2019m off my meds.

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse.

He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is concerning to hear that your son has been experiencing tremors since he was a baby and recently started closing his eyes and shaking his head. While it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis without a thorough evaluation by a medical professional, there are several possibilities that could explain these symptoms.\n\nOne possibility is that your son could be experiencing a type of seizure called absence seizures, which are characterized by brief episodes of staring off into space or making repetitive movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures typically last for a few seconds and may not be as noticeable as other types of seizures.\n\nAnother possibility is that your son could be experiencing involuntary movements known as tics, which are sudden, repetitive muscle movements or vocalizations. Tics are common in children and are often associated with conditions such as Tourette syndrome.\n\nTeething is also a possibility, as discomfort from teething can sometimes cause children to exhibit unusual movements or behaviors. However, teething typically does not cause the type of repetitive shaking movements you described.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your son's neurologist to discuss his symptoms and determine the appropriate course of action. The neurologist may recommend further testing, such as an EEG or MRI, to help determine the cause of his symptoms and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, keeping a journal of your son's symptoms, including when they occur and any triggers or patterns you notice, can be helpful for the neurologist in making a diagnosis."

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",

        "answer": "I would recommend discussing your concerns with your psychiatrist. It's great that you have a good relationship with your psychiatrist and that she trusts you to do your own research, but it's always important to consult with a medical professional about potential drug interactions and risks. It may be worth considering alternatives to Trazodone or adjusting your current medication regimen to reduce the risk of potential side effects like seizures. Your psychiatrist can work with you to find a solution that addresses your insomnia and anxiety while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.

        "question": "I have been diagnosed with Ped Mal seizures since I was young. It has been triggered at times due to various reasons however those reasons have never been gaming. I ran into a game that gave a warning for Photosensitive epilepsy for its intense flashing however I play many games that have intense flashing but haven't had a episode. I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great to hear that you haven't had any seizure episodes since starting the medication. While you may have successfully played games with intense flashing in the past without any issues, it's important to remember that each person's triggers for seizures can be different. It's always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.\n\nIf a game specifically warns about the potential for photosensitive epilepsy due to its intense flashing, it's probably best to avoid playing that particular game. Even if you've been fine with similar games in the past, there's always a risk that this particular game could trigger a seizure.\n\nIt might be a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider or neurologist about your concerns regarding playing this game. They can provide you with personalized advice and guidance on whether it's safe for you to play, based on your individual circumstances and medical history.\n\nOverall, it's important to prioritize your health and safety above all else. As much as it may be tempting to try out the game, it's not worth risking a potential seizure. Always listen to your body and follow the guidelines set by your healthcare provider."

        "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's important to consult with a healthcare professional about your symptoms, as they may be able to provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. It's possible that your symptoms could be related to epilepsy, especially given your family history of seizures. It's better to be cautious and get evaluated by a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy sleep schedule and avoid excessive alcohol consumption to see if that helps reduce the frequency of these spells."

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "answer": "deficiency. \n\nBased on the symptoms you described, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any potential medical issues. Focal seizures can manifest in various ways, including the symptoms of confusion, disorganized thoughts, and repetitive behaviors that you mentioned. It is not possible to fake or make up medical symptoms, but it is important to be honest and open with your healthcare provider about your experiences.\n\nGiven your history of anxiety, depression, hyperhidrosis, and medication use, it is essential to consider the potential interactions between your medications and any new symptoms you may be experiencing. Additionally, the association between your symptoms and triggers such as fatigue, certain foods, or stress should be carefully evaluated.\n\nKeeping a detailed diary of your symptoms, triggers, and any potential warning signs before an episode may help you and your healthcare provider better understand the situation. This can also assist in determining whether these episodes are related to migraine aura or focal seizures.\n\nIt is recommended that you schedule an appointment with a neurologist or epileptologist for a thorough evaluation and further testing, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor and assess brain activity. It's essential to prioritize your health and seek medical attention to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan."

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your recent diagnosis and struggles with your current treatment plan. It's frustrating when your healthcare provider isn't open to discussing potential treatment options with you. It might be helpful to seek a second opinion from another neurologist who may be more willing to discuss the use of 4-AP or other medication options for your condition.\n\nIn the meantime, you can continue to do your own research on 4-AP and other potential treatments for EA2. It's important to be informed about your condition and the various treatment options available to you. You may also want to consider reaching out to patient advocacy groups or online forums for support and information from others who have experience with EA2.\n\nI understand the challenges of navigating insurance and finding affordable care options. It might be worth exploring if there are any clinical trials or research studies for EA2 treatment that you could potentially participate in. These studies often provide access to cutting-edge treatments and may be covered by the study sponsor.\n\nOverall, it's important to advocate for yourself and your healthcare needs. Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek second opinions, and explore all available options for managing your condition. Best of luck on your journey to finding the right treatment plan for you."

        "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",

My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow.

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

        "answer": "I am so sorry to hear about your fiance's condition. Status epilepticus is a very serious and life-threatening condition, and it sounds like the medical team is doing everything they can to try to control her seizures. It is not uncommon for patients with SRSE to be put into a medically induced coma in order to try to break the cycle of seizures.\n\nIt is difficult to say what the long-term outcome will be for your fiance, as every case is unique. It is possible for patients to recover and regain normal mental functioning after a prolonged period of seizures, but it can be a slow and difficult process. It is important to continue to support her and to stay in close contact with her medical team for updates on her condition.\n\nI would recommend asking her doctors about any experimental treatments or clinical trials that may be available for her condition. It is also important to make sure she is receiving the best possible care and to advocate for her needs.\n\nI wish you and your fiance all the best during this difficult time. Do not hesitate to reach out for support and information as you navigate this challenging situation."

        "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone refers to an enlargement of the brain ventricle due to loss of brain tissue, typically as a result of injury or disease. \n\nT-weighted high-signal gliosis refers to an abnormal increase in the number of glial cells in the brain, often seen as a response to injury or inflammation.\n\nAbnormalities involving the right hippocampus could indicate structural or functional issues with that particular part of the brain, which is involved in memory and learning.\n\nAssociated regional atrophy refers to a loss of brain tissue in a specific area, in this case, the dorsal right thalamus.\n\nPeriventricular white matter is a region of the brain located around the ventricles that contains nerve fibers. Damage to this area could be indicative of underlying issues related to the epilepsy. \n\nThese terms all point towards potential sources of the epileptic seizures and may provide insight into the underlying causes of your condition. It's important to discuss these findings with your neurologist to better understand how they may be affecting your epilepsy and potential treatment options."

I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",

        "answer": "It sounds like you are dealing with a complex and concerning array of symptoms. It's important to continue advocating for yourself and seeking answers from your healthcare providers. A neuro-ophthalmologist may be able to provide further insight into the cause of your eye symptoms. Additionally, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from another neurologist or specialist to explore other potential diagnoses or treatment options. Keep track of your symptoms and any changes you notice, and communicate these clearly with your healthcare team. Stay proactive in your healthcare journey and don't hesitate to ask for further testing or referrals if needed. Wishing you the best in finding a resolution to your health concerns."

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am not a medical professional, but based on the information you have provided, it does seem possible that the Keppra was helping to control the epilepsy symptoms and by removing it, the hallucinations have returned. It is also possible that the hallucinations could be a manifestation of the PNES rather than directly related to the epilepsy. \n\nIt is important to discuss these concerns with your wife's healthcare providers as soon as possible. They will be able to provide the most accurate information and guidance on how to proceed. It may be necessary to explore different treatment options or medications to address both the epilepsy and PNES symptoms. \n\nIn the meantime, it is important to ensure that your wife is receiving appropriate support and care for her condition. Encourage open communication with her healthcare providers and continue to advocate for her needs. It may also be helpful for you to seek support for yourself as caring for a loved one with complex medical issues can be challenging. \n\nTake care and best of luck on your wife's journey to better health."

        "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is understandable to feel hesitant about increasing the dosage of your son's medication if he is already responding well. However, it is important to remember that epilepsy is a complex neurological condition and finding the right dosage of medication for each individual can be a process of trial and error.\n\nThe neurologist may be recommending an increase in dosage to ensure that your son's seizures remain under control in the long term. It is possible that the current dosage may not be fully preventing seizures or that your son's body may build up a tolerance to the medication over time.\n\nIt is important to trust in your neurologist's expertise and judgment, as they have the experience and knowledge to make these decisions based on your son's specific medical needs. If you have concerns or questions about the dosage increase, it is always a good idea to discuss them openly with your healthcare provider.

Swelling of lymph nodes is a common side effect of vaccinations, as they are a normal part of the immune response to the vaccine. In most cases, this swelling is temporary and resolves on its own.\n\nHowever, it is always important to mention any new symptoms or concerns to your healthcare provider, especially given your medical history and recent antibiotic use. Your doctor will be able to assess the lump and determine if any further investigation or treatment is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to worry too much and focus on taking care of yourself.

Additionally, I am curious how likely it is I would have died from consuming that much Keppra and if a death from keppra would be painful.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is important to note that taking a large amount of any medication, including Keppra, can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. In your case, consuming 42 grams of Keppra is a significant overdose, as the typical daily dose for epilepsy treatment is around 1-3 grams. The fact that you vomited and fell asleep afterwards could have been your body's way of trying to expel the excess medication. \n\nIt is difficult to predict the specific long-term health effects that may result from this single overdose. However, possible complications could include kidney or liver damage, as these organs are responsible for metabolizing and excreting medications from the body. In terms of brain damage, Keppra is primarily used to treat seizures and is not known to directly cause brain damage in overdose situations.\n\nIn terms of the likelihood of death from consuming 42 grams of Keppra, it is difficult to say without specific details about your overall health, metabolism, and other factors. Keppra overdoses are relatively rare and there is limited information available on the toxic dose that could result in death. However, it is important to seek medical attention immediately if you or someone you know ingests a large amount of any medication.\n\nAs for whether a death from Keppra overdose would be painful, it is likely that any overdose resulting in death would be accompanied by severe symptoms such as seizures, respiratory depression, and cardiac complications, which could indeed be painful. It is crucial to avoid taking excessive amounts of medications and to always follow prescribed dosages to prevent potentially dangerous consequences. If you have any concerns about the effects of your overdose, it is recommended that you speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance."

In the picture you see two on my left side, there can be another one on the left tip and the same can be mirrored on the right side. The most I had at the same time were 3 of these. They are painful, especially on contact (when eating); it's a burning sensation most of the time. They start small, get bigger and then develop a white \"ring\" instead of the red (in the photo), after this state the tongue gets white and the whole mouth has an unpleasant taste. But I would actually say I have good oral hygiene. Could this be related to one of my diseases, or could it be a side effect or something completely unrelated? I've already asked one of my doctors but he had no idea what this could be (out of his field). Which doctor would you suggest visiting, a dermatologist? I'm hoping to find someone here to help me out. I would be thankful for any ideas about what this might be, how to reduce the pain (except for standard painkillers) or to prevent it completely.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the discomfort you've been experiencing with the red patches on your tongue. Given the range of medications you're on and the complexity of your medical history, it's important to consider various factors that could be contributing to this issue.\n\nOne possibility is that the patches on your tongue could be related to one of your existing conditions or medications. For example, oral manifestations are known to occur in autoimmune diseases like SLE. It's also possible that the patches could be a side effect of one of your medications, particularly since you're on a combination of drugs that may interact with each other.\n\nGiven the nature of your symptoms and the fact that your current doctor was unable to provide a definitive answer, it would be a good idea to consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist. In this case, a dermatologist or an oral medicine specialist would be the most appropriate healthcare provider to consult regarding your tongue condition. They have expertise in diagnosing and treating various oral health issues, including those that may be related to systemic diseases or medications.\n\nIn the meantime, to help reduce the pain and discomfort of the red patches on your tongue, you may consider using a soothing mouthwash or oral gel specifically designed for mouth sores. It's also essential to maintain good oral hygiene practices and to avoid any potential triggers, such as spicy or acidic foods, that may exacerbate the symptoms. Keeping a food diary can help identify any potential triggers and guide you in making dietary modifications.\n\nOverall, it's essential to address this concern with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan to manage this issue effectively. I hope you find relief soon and get the answers you need."

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",

        "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your husband's recent seizure and the results of his MRI. Encephalomalacia and gliosis are common findings following a lesionectomy, as they represent areas of scar tissue and inflammation where the surgery took place. This is a normal part of the healing process and can sometimes be seen on MRI scans.\n\nThe presence of encephalomalacia and gliosis near the resection site does not necessarily mean that your husband will need another surgery. It could indicate that there is some ongoing irritation or inflammation in the area that may need to be managed with medication. Your neurologist will be able to provide more insight into the significance of these findings and recommend appropriate treatment options.\n\nIt's important to remember that every case is unique, and treatment decisions should be made based on your husband's individual circumstances and needs. It's understandable to be anxious about what the future holds, but try to take things one step at a time and trust in the expertise of your healthcare team.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to support your husband and follow any recommendations from his neurologist. Keeping a seizure diary and monitoring any changes in his symptoms can also be helpful in guiding treatment decisions. Stay strong and take care."

Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a seizure but it\u2019s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it\u2019s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d.

        "answer": "Synesthesia is a real neurological phenomenon where one sensory perception triggers another unrelated sensation. It is not pseudoscience and is recognized by the scientific community. In your case, it is possible that the controlled epilepsy has somehow triggered these sensations, but without more information, it is difficult to say for sure.\n\nIt is important that you continue to discuss these sensations with your neurologist and possibly see a mental health professional to ensure that there are no underlying mental health issues manifesting. It is good that you are aware of these sensations and are willing to seek help if needed.\n\nOverall, it is essential to stay proactive in managing your health and continue to communicate openly with your healthcare providers about any changes or concerns you may have."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "First of all, I want to assure you that it is common for MRI reports to have findings that may sound concerning but are actually quite common and may not always indicate a serious issue. In your case, the MRI report indicates that there are a few small areas of abnormality in the white matter of the brain on the right side. These areas show up as punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality.\n\nThe impression suggests that these findings may be related to microvascular ischemic changes, which are tiny changes in the blood vessels that supply the brain. This can sometimes happen with age and may be a result of conditions like atherosclerosis or high blood pressure. The report also mentions that demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis, cannot be completely ruled out based on these findings.\n\nIt is important to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider, as they will be able to provide more context and advice based on your medical history, symptoms, and overall health. They may recommend further testing or monitoring to better understand the significance of these findings and to determine the best course of action moving forward.

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you have been managing your epilepsy well with the help of Lamictal, but you have experienced some breakthrough seizures recently. It's possible that the decrease in blood levels of Lamictal could be contributing to your seizures, as you mentioned that changing to newer bottles seemed to improve your symptoms.\n\nBased on your experiences, it may be a good idea to follow your neurologist's advice and switch to the newer bottles with a longer expiration date. While it's true that medications can still be effective past their expiration date, there may be slight variations in potency that could impact your treatment.\n\nAs for the change in dosage form from 200mg XR to 300mg XR, this should not significantly impact your blood levels as long as you are taking the prescribed dose. The extended-release formulation is designed to release the medication over a longer period of time, so the slight difference in dosage should not cause any issues.\n\nIt's important to discuss these concerns with your neurologist, as they can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current symptoms. They may recommend changes to your medication regimen or suggest other strategies to help manage your epilepsy more effectively."

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",

        "answer": "I understand your concerns and skepticism about the explanation given by the neurologist. It is always important to trust your instincts and seek further opinions or information if needed. \n\nWhile it is true that some babies can experience seizures due to various reasons, including lack of oxygen during birth or other medical conditions, it is still important to thoroughly investigate the cause of the seizures in this specific case. It is not common for a baby to experience seizures three days after birth due to the mother being hungry, cold, or scared during delivery. \n\nI would recommend discussing your concerns with the family and encouraging them to seek a second opinion or further medical evaluation if necessary. It is important to ensure the safety and well-being of the baby, and getting a thorough understanding of the situation is crucial in this case. \n\nUltimately, trust your instincts and seek additional information or support if needed.

        "answer": "Based on the symptoms described, it is possible that the individual may have a rare autoimmune disorder such as Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) or Systemic Vasculitis. These conditions can present with a combination of neurological symptoms, low potassium, anemia, positive ANA, GFR fluctuations, blood clotting issues, vision disturbances, joint swelling, and other systemic manifestations. It may be beneficial for the individual to seek a second opinion from a rheumatologist or hematologist specializing in autoimmune disorders for further evaluation and management. Further testing for specific antibodies associated with APS or Systemic Vasculitis may be warranted to confirm a diagnosis."

        "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your mum's recent struggles with absent seizures. It's important to remember that epilepsy management can be a complex process and sometimes adjustments to medication or additional treatments may be necessary. Here are some suggestions that may help improve your mum's situation:\n\n1. Consult with a neurologist specializing in epilepsy: It might be beneficial for your mum to see a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy to get a second opinion on her current treatment plan and explore other possible medication options.\n\n2. Keep a seizure diary: Keeping a detailed record of when the absent seizures occur, any triggers, and their duration can help identify patterns and potential triggers. This information can be valuable for healthcare providers when evaluating treatment options.\n\n3. Explore alternative treatments: In addition to medication, there are other treatments such as dietary changes, relaxation techniques, and neurofeedback therapy that may help with seizure control. It's essential to discuss these options with healthcare professionals before implementing them.\n\n4. Create a safe environment: Given that your mum has been accidentally injuring herself during absent seizures, it's important to ensure her safety at all times. Removing sharp objects, installing padding on furniture, and ensuring someone is always around to supervise her can help prevent injuries.\n\n5. Seek support: Dealing with epilepsy can be challenging, both for the individual and their loved ones. Joining support groups or connecting with others who have experience with epilepsy can provide valuable emotional support and coping strategies.\n\nIt's great that your mum will be seeing a psychologist in the New Year as her mental health and emotional well-being are essential components of overall epilepsy management. Remember to stay patient and persistent in finding the right treatment approach for your mum. Wishing you and your mum all the best in finding solutions to improve her quality of life."

        "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It\u2019s interesting that you have these intense vinegar cravings every few months. It\u2019s possible that these cravings could be related to a nutrient deficiency, but it\u2019s hard to say for sure without further information. Some research suggests that cravings for certain foods, like vinegar or other acidic foods, could be related to a need for specific nutrients like magnesium, potassium, or vitamin C. However, it\u2019s always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and advice.\n\nGiven your existing medical issues and medications, it\u2019s important to discuss these cravings with your healthcare provider to rule out any potential underlying health concerns. They may be able to offer insight or suggest further testing to determine if there\u2019s a specific nutrient deficiency or other reason behind your cravings.\n\nIn the meantime, if these cravings are not negatively impacting your health or daily life, it may be okay to indulge in moderation. Just be mindful of your overall dietary balance and make sure you\u2019re getting a variety of nutrients from your meals and snacks. And if you find yourself experiencing these intense cravings more frequently or if they start to impact your health, definitely reach out to your healthcare provider for further guidance."

I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don\u2019t feel quite normal at the moment and I\u2019m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it\u2019s my first ever post on Reddit and I\u2019m just very confused about what\u2019s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible that the tiredness and dizziness you're experiencing could be side effects of the medication. While Keppra is generally a well-tolerated medication, some people may experience certain side effects over time. It's important to speak with your doctor about any new symptoms you're experiencing, as they may need to adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication.\n\nIt's also important to consider other factors that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as stress, poor sleep quality, or other health conditions. Keeping a journal of your symptoms and discussing them with your doctor can help determine the underlying cause and develop a plan to address them.\n\nOverall, it's not likely that Keppra would suddenly stop working after 3-4 years of use, but it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider to rule out any potential concerns. Be sure to mention any changes in your symptoms, as well as your concerns about the medication's effectiveness."

        "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "First and foremost, it's important to follow the guidance of your healthcare provider when it comes to weaning off Keppra. It sounds like you are already in communication with the neurologist who prescribed the medication, which is a good first step.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to gradually taper off Keppra rather than stopping it abruptly. This can help reduce the risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms or a return of seizures. Your neurologist should be able to provide you with a specific tapering schedule based on your individual circumstances.\n\nRegarding the risk of having another seizure after coming off Keppra, it's important to remember that your previous seizures were likely triggered by the eclampsia and high blood pressure, rather than being related to epilepsy. Since your blood pressure is now under control and the eclampsia has stabilized, it is less likely that you are at risk for a repeat seizure.\n\nHowever, it's always best to err on the side of caution and continue to follow the advice of your healthcare provider. If you have concerns about caring for your newborn while coming off Keppra, be sure to express these to your neurologist so they can provide you with the necessary support and guidance.\n\nIt's understandable to feel anxious about coming off medication, especially when caring for a newborn. Remember to prioritize your own health and well-being, and don't hesitate to seek support from healthcare professionals, family, or friends during this transition period."

        "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",

        "answer": "It sounds like you have been through a lot with your health concerns and I'm sorry you are having to deal with all of these issues. It is understandable that you are feeling scared and overwhelmed.\n\nTo address your questions:\n\n1. It is possible that your symptoms could be due to a vascular issue such as a dissection or TIA, rather than seizures. Both dissections and TIAs can sometimes cause symptoms that mimic seizures, such as the electric shock sensation you described. It is important for your medical team to continue investigating to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\n2. Seizures can sometimes be a complication of a dissection or TIA, but it is not the most common presentation. It is important for your doctors to carefully evaluate your symptoms to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n\n3. It is not uncommon for seizure medications to have side effects such as brain fog and other issues. It is important to communicate with your healthcare team about how you are feeling on the medication so they can adjust as needed. It is also possible that you may not need to be on seizure medications long-term, depending on the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\n4. It is possible to develop epilepsy at any age, so it is important for your doctors to continue monitoring and evaluating your symptoms to determine the best course of treatment for you.\n\nI hope this information is helpful and I wish you all the best in your journey to better health."

In the future, you may want to discuss with your doctor a plan for scheduling appointments and obtaining prescription refills in a timely manner to prevent any interruptions in your medication regimen.\n\nIf you are unable to schedule an appointment before your prescription runs out, it is important to contact your doctor\u2019s office to discuss the situation and see if there is a way to expedite the process. You may also want to ask your pharmacist if there are any options for obtaining a temporary supply of medication while you wait for your appointment.\n\nOverall, it is essential to advocate for your own health and well-being in situations like this. If you continue to experience difficulties in obtaining your medication, you may want to consider seeking a second opinion or discussing your concerns with a patient advocate or healthcare administrator."

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your recent diagnosis and the challenges you are facing with your memory and concentration. It's important to follow the treatment plan prescribed by your neurologist and give it some time to see if there are any improvements in your symptoms.\n\nIt's difficult to predict whether the damage to your short-term memory is reversible or not. Everyone's condition is unique and may respond differently to treatment. It's important to continue working with your healthcare team to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is different from epilepsy. It's important to discuss any concerns you have about future potential complications with your healthcare provider.\n\nIn the meantime, it may be helpful to explore memory enhancement techniques and strategies to help cope with memory and concentration difficulties. This could include things like creating lists, using reminder apps, and practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques to help reduce stress and improve focus.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself and seek support from loved ones or a counselor if needed. Stay in communication with your healthcare team and don't hesitate to ask any questions or voice any concerns you may have. Stay positive and keep working towards better health and well-being."

They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder.

I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn\u2019t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can\u2019t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure.

It\u2019s probably about a year that this situation while i am trying to sleep happens. Wold really love to have an EEG bit when i went to the neurologist a year ago he only diagnosed me with anxiety combined with elements of OCD. He did some reflex/eyesight tests and all came back with no neurological deficit. I\u2019d get an EEG but i am literally such a hypochondriac that my parents are concerned and i just went through blood tests and i don\u2019t want to worry them again!

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety and possibly panic attacks. Deja vu, dream flashbacks, body vibrations, buzzing sensations, and racing heart are all common symptoms of anxiety. It is also common for anxiety to manifest itself as a fear of serious medical conditions such as brain tumors or epilepsy.\n\nIt is important to remember that anxiety can cause physical symptoms that mimic serious medical conditions, but that does not mean you actually have those conditions. It is also common for anxiety to worsen when trying to sleep, leading to difficulties falling asleep and intrusive thoughts.\n\nIt is recommended that you seek help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist, to help you manage your anxiety. They can provide you with coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy, to help you manage your symptoms. It may also be helpful to talk to your parents about your concerns and seek their support in seeking treatment.\n\nWhile an EEG may provide reassurance, it is important to address the underlying anxiety that is causing your symptoms. Remember that you are not alone in experiencing anxiety and there is help available to support you through this difficult time."

I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow.

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your recent diagnosis of epilepsy and the impact it has had on your daily life. It can definitely be frustrating not having a clear answer as to what may be causing your seizures. It sounds like you've already undergone a lot of testing and evaluations to try and identify a potential cause, which is a good start.\n\nEpilepsy can have various causes, including genetics, head injuries, brain infections, brain tumors, and other neurological conditions. In some cases, the cause of epilepsy may not be clear, which is referred to as idiopathic epilepsy.\n\nGiven your complex medical history and medication regimen, it's possible that one of your preexisting conditions or medications could be a contributing factor to your seizures. It's important to continue working closely with your healthcare providers, including neurologists, to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nIn addition, lifestyle factors such as stress, lack of sleep, and substance use (including vaping and smoking weed) can also potentially trigger seizures in some individuals with epilepsy. It may be helpful to discuss these factors with your healthcare providers and explore ways to manage them effectively.\n\nOverall, managing epilepsy requires a comprehensive approach that may include medication management, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare team. It's important to stay proactive in managing your condition and seeking support from healthcare professionals and loved ones.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you all the best in managing your epilepsy and overall health.

Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

The build-up of toxins in the blood can affect brain function and lead to seizures. Going off Xifaxan, which is commonly used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, could potentially contribute to the return of seizures in your father. It is important to discuss this with his healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.\n\nIt is also concerning that your father is experiencing frequent seizures and other symptoms related to his liver disease.

Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment.

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

        "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "As a future doctor, it is important to consider differential diagnoses when evaluating cognitive impairment in a patient. In the case of your mother, it is important to rule out other potential medical or psychiatric conditions that could mimic symptoms of dementia. \n\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and clock drawing test are commonly used screening tools for dementia. The MMSE assesses various cognitive functions such as orientation, memory, attention, language, and visuospatial abilities. The clock drawing test evaluates executive functioning and visuospatial skills. These tests can help provide a baseline assessment of cognitive function and aid in identifying potential cognitive deficits that may be indicative of dementia. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that these screening tests are not diagnostic on their own and should be used in conjunction with a thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing to rule out other potential causes of cognitive impairment. Additionally, consulting with a neurologist or geriatric psychiatrist for further evaluation and assessment may be warranted in cases where a definitive diagnosis is needed. \n\nUltimately, it is important to approach the evaluation and management of cognitive impairment in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner to ensure the best possible care for your mother."

It feels more neurological, if that makes sense.My body will feel like it's shaking on the inside, almost like it's vibrating. Usually when I'm tired.I have urge incontinence probably due to years of battling constipation. Must admit, I think it's getting better as it's not as frequently happening as it was.My left nostril will drip or run snot sometimes without me even realizing it (newer symptom) My primary doctor said it's probably just post nasal drip and prescribed me nasal spray twice a day. It does help dry it out but if I miss even one time, my husband will point out it running down.Recently switched neurologist and had a EEG done which I had an episode though it showed on the test and the nurse helped me through it, it registered as not a seizure or he said it didn't convince him that it was though the nurse clearly saw it.  At times when I'm feeling off I'm rushed with rapid heart beat, shakiness, and I can't read (everything looks to be in another language). At this point I feel confused, scared, angry, and rushed. Happens a lot when I have decisions to make. Restaurants, retail store, airport, etc.I get brain fog a lot but as long as I take my nuvigil I do a lot better.Here's why I'm posting... I can hear everything while having an episode, though sometimes when I repeat back what was happening while I have a seizure it's not all the way correct. I can't talk during it. My eyes roll back. The last one I shook some, which doesn't usually happens. I've had times where my hands cripple up (rarely). I usually feel a \"drooping\" or pulling in my bottom lip when things start and a complete lack of ability to use my muscles. They feel really heavy. I tend to stare right beforehand. The second to last episode I felt a pulling sensation, like someone was turning my head towards the left. When it ended, I head was facing left.My neurologist is putting me on Vimpat. I was taking Xyrem for ten years but last year I switched to ambien because my snoring got really bad.Current medication: Ambien 5mg Nuvigil 250mg I have an IUD I'll be starting Vimpat 100mgWasn't very active in my 20's Started working out in my 30's Past year in a half I have focused on strength training and cardio 5-6 times a week.",

        "question": "An MRI with Neuroquant showed these normative percentiles: Hippocampal Occupancy Score \u2013 32 Hippocampi \u2013 72 Superior Lateral Ventricles \u2013 94 Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74 The hippocampal volume seems normal but the hippocampal occupancy score is very low. What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward. My information: 24F, 110 pounds, conditions: epilepsy, history of COVID, history of vaccine reaction, medications: Trileptal, location of problem: brain, duration: 9 months",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am not a medical professional, but based on the information provided, a low hippocampal occupancy score can indicate atrophy or damage to the hippocampus, which is a critical brain region for memory and emotional regulation. Given your symptoms of memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression, it is possible that the changes in your hippocampal occupancy score may be contributing to these issues.\n\nThe fact that you have a history of epilepsy, COVID, vaccine reaction, and past use of CBD oil with negative effects could all be contributing factors to the changes in your brain. It is important to discuss these findings with a neurologist or a healthcare provider who can provide further evaluation and management.\n\nIn terms of prognosis, it is difficult to determine without a full evaluation, but addressing the potential underlying causes and optimizing treatment for your conditions may help improve your symptoms. It is important to continue working with your healthcare team to monitor and address any changes in your condition."

        "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination.

You may want to consider reaching out to local health authorities or vaccine adverse event reporting systems to report her experiences and seek guidance.\n\nIn the meantime, it may also be helpful for your girlfriend to keep a detailed journal of her symptoms, including triggers, timing, and any accompanying symptoms, to help medical professionals better understand the pattern of her condition.\n\nAdditionally, reaching out to support groups for individuals experiencing post-vaccination complications or rare health conditions may provide you both with a sense of community and resources for navigating this challenging situation.\n\nPlease know that you are not alone in this, and it is essential to continue advocating for your girlfriend's health and well-being. Stay strong, and I hope that you will find the answers and support you need to improve her quality of life."

        "question": "I\u2019m a 23 year old female. I have recently been getting very dizzy, my body gets hot and seeing stars until my vision disappears completely and I can\u2019t see at all and it doesn\u2019t go away until I lay down or sit. I have never had a problem like this ever but it\u2019s starting to interfere with my life because I\u2019m always having to sit. I\u2019m 5\u201d3 and I weigh around a 100 pounds. My weight does fluctuate a lot (+ or - 5 pounds every week) I try to eat healthy but I also sometimes can\u2019t get myself to eat because I feel anxiety and my heart starts beating weird. I also have epilepsy and I am on Keppra and have been on it for almost 3 years so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem but I try to take it on time, I take 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don\u2019t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time. I add a lot of salt on my food, I eat a lot of olives and a lot of pickles, sometimes I will individually season spoonfuls or food before putting them in my mouth because it\u2019s what tastes good to me (if that is of any significance)And I do drink alcohol about 3 times a week",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's important to see a doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause of your dizziness and vision loss. This could be related to a variety of factors, including your epilepsy medication, your fluctuating weight, or possibly an underlying health issue. It's possible that your salt intake could be contributing to your symptoms, as excessive sodium can lead to dehydration and other health complications. Additionally, anxiety and irregular heartbeats could also be contributing factors.\n\nIt's important to receive a thorough medical evaluation to determine the root cause of your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend changes to your medication, diet, or lifestyle to help manage your symptoms. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, eat regular meals, and reduce your alcohol consumption to see if that helps alleviate your symptoms. Take care of yourself and prioritize your health."

        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some information based on what I know. Chiropractic treatment and acupuncture are alternative approaches that some people with epilepsy have tried, but their effectiveness in treating epilepsy is not scientifically proven. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider before trying any new treatments to ensure they are safe and appropriate for you.\n\nSome other options you may consider discussing with your specialist are different medications, dietary supplements, or dietary therapies such as the ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet. Additionally, there are non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) that are being researched for their potential benefits in treating epilepsy. \n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to work closely with your healthcare team to find the right treatment plan for you. They will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information and recommendations based on your specific situation."

I've always had intense headaches post ECT and during the first session I had intense deja vu experiences 2-10 times per day, this after about 1,5 months lowered to 3 times per week but up to 10 times a day. With this I developed difficulties placing people I've recently met, when I had gotten to know a face something in me just told me that I had known them since long. This time around, everyone I meet I recognise. Yesterday I was hours away from my hometown, and somehow I only met people I knew...but no one said hello...Anyone know information about this occurrence and whether it's a neurological concern or just a temporary side effect? My ECT-nurse had never heard of it before.Info: Male, 24 y/o, Caucasian, mucho depressed, no medications only ECT.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's definitely concerning that you are experiencing such intense cognitive side effects after receiving ECT. While headaches are a common side effect of ECT, the intense deja vu experiences and difficulty recognizing people you have recently met are not typical side effects. It's possible that these symptoms may be related to the ECT treatments, but it's important to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider.\n\nIt's also possible that these symptoms could be related to a neurological issue or another underlying condition that may need to be addressed. I would recommend seeking further evaluation from a neurologist or another specialist to determine the cause of these symptoms and to determine the best course of action.\n\nIn the meantime, be sure to communicate your concerns with your ECT-nurse and healthcare provider so they can help monitor your symptoms and provide appropriate care. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being, so don't hesitate to seek additional medical attention if needed."

        "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like your daughter's episodes are quite concerning and could potentially be a sign of a more serious underlying issue. While it's always a good idea to consider anxiety and stress as potential triggers for sleep disturbances, the specific nature of these episodes may warrant further investigation.\n\nGiven that these episodes started suddenly after a trip and a UTI, it may be worth discussing these symptoms with your daughter's healthcare provider. It's possible that there could be a neurological or sleep disorder at play, especially if these episodes continue to occur.\n\nSome possible conditions to consider could include sleep disorders such as parasomnias (e.g., sleepwalking, night terrors) or even seizure disorders. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider, possibly a pediatric neurologist, may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of these episodes.\n\nIn the meantime, it may be helpful to keep a detailed log of your daughter's episodes, including any potential triggers, frequency, and any other relevant information. This information can be valuable in helping healthcare providers better understand the nature of these episodes and come up with an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nOverall, if you have any concerns about your daughter's sleep disturbances, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance."

        "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with your depression despite taking citalopram. It is possible for SSRIs like citalopram to initially worsen symptoms of depression before improvements are seen. It's important to talk to your GP before making any changes to your medication, as abruptly stopping citalopram can lead to withdrawal symptoms and potentially worsen your symptoms.\n\nWhen you do speak with your GP, you can discuss your concerns about citalopram and explore other possible antidepressant options. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is sometimes used for depression and migraines, but it may not be the best option for you given your current medications and symptoms.\n\nYour GP can give you guidance on which antidepressant might be a good fit for you, taking into consideration your current medications and medical history. They may also be able to provide support and additional resources to help manage your depression.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to reach out for support if you're feeling suicidal or overwhelmed. You can contact a mental health helpline or seek help from a therapist or counselor. Take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health during this time."

We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you are facing with your son's health. It is completely understandable that you are feeling anxious and worried about the possibility of another seizure. It is important to remember that epilepsy can be unpredictable, but with the right medication and management, many individuals are able to live fulfilling lives with minimal seizures.\n\nThe likelihood of your son having a breakthrough seizure can vary depending on his individual case and medical history. It is important to work closely with his pediatric neurologist and epilepsy specialist to monitor his condition and adjust his medication as needed. They will be able to provide more specific information about the likelihood of future seizures and the best ways to manage them.\n\nIt is also important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. It is natural to feel overwhelmed and stressed when caring for a child with complex medical needs, but it is important to find ways to manage your anxiety and find support. Consider reaching out to a therapist or support group for parents of children with epilepsy.\n\nIn terms of letting your son be a kid and allowing him to have privacy, it is important to find a balance between keeping him safe and allowing him to explore and experience the world. It is okay to take precautions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, but try to find ways to gradually reintroduce activities and experiences that are important for his development and happiness.\n\nOverall, communication with your son's medical team, prioritizing your own mental health, and finding a balance between safety and independence are key in navigating the challenges of caring for a child with epilepsy. Remember that you are doing the best you can for your son, and it is okay to ask for help and support when needed."

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is possible for someone to feel a seizure happening inside their head, as seizures can manifest in various ways depending on the individual and the type of seizure. Some people may experience sensations such as tingling, pressure, or a sense of disorientation in their head before a seizure spreads to other parts of the body. \n\nNot all seizures show up on an EEG because the brain activity during a seizure can be localized and may not always be detected by the electrodes on the scalp. Additionally, some types of seizures, such as absence seizures, may not produce significant changes in brain activity that are detectable on an EEG.\n\nIt is also possible for someone to not notice or feel a seizure happening but later experience symptoms or sensations that could be related to a seizure. This could be due to various factors such as the type of seizure, the individual's awareness or consciousness during the seizure, and other underlying medical conditions.\n\nI recommend consulting with a healthcare provider or neurologist for further information and guidance on seizures and their effects.

What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

        "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can try to provide some information based on what you have shared. \n\nChiari malformations are structural defects in the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that controls balance. While it is possible for someone to have both epilepsy and a Chiari malformation, it is important to note that they are considered separate conditions with different causes. \n\nIn some cases, Chiari malformations can cause symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, and balance problems. However, not all individuals with Chiari malformations will have symptoms or require treatment. \n\nIt is possible that the Chiari malformation was present before your son was diagnosed with epilepsy, and it was only discovered during the MRI in February. It may be worth discussing your concerns about the potential relationship between the Chiari malformation and epilepsy with your son's healthcare provider. They will be able to provide more information and guidance based on your son's specific medical history and needs. \n\nIt is important to continue working closely with your son's healthcare team to monitor his epilepsy and Chiari malformation and to ensure he is receiving appropriate treatment and support."

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you have been through a lot with trying to figure out the cause of your double vision episodes. It's frustrating when you have seen multiple doctors and still don't have a clear answer. \n\nGiven your history of minor concussions and the fact that the double vision episodes started after a benzo overdose, it may be worth considering seeing a neurologist again. They may be able to conduct more specialized tests or imaging to further investigate any possible brain injury or neurological issues that could be causing your symptoms. \n\nIn the meantime, keeping track of your symptoms, triggers, and any changes in your vision can be helpful for the doctor to have a more complete picture of what you are experiencing. It's also important to continue following up with your primary care doctor and any specialists to monitor your overall health and address any new symptoms that may arise. \n\nOverall, it's important to advocate for yourself and seek out the care and support you need to address your concerns and find answers. Don't hesitate to seek out medical help if your symptoms worsen or if you have any new symptoms that concern you. I hope you are able to find some answers and relief soon."

        "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I recommend consulting with a medical professional or physical therapist to discuss your brother's specific needs and find the best solution for his situation. They may be able to recommend a type of walker or mobility aid that can help support him and prevent falls, or provide guidance on possible adjustments to existing equipment to make it more secure.\n\nIn terms of specific products, there are a variety of mobility aids available on the market that can provide added support and stability during walks. These can include rollators with built-in seats or harness systems for added security. You may also want to look into products specifically designed for individuals with conditions such as epilepsy or balance issues.\n\nUltimately, safety should be the top priority, so it's essential to find a solution that can effectively support your brother's weight and provide the necessary protection in case of a fall."

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your wife's difficult situation. It's understandable that you're feeling worried and concerned about her health. It sounds like her doctors have been proactive in investigating her symptoms and adjusting her medication accordingly.\n\nIt's important to continue to communicate with her healthcare providers about any new or unusual symptoms she may be experiencing. It's possible that the itching and other symptoms she's experiencing could be related to her medication or could be a sign of another underlying issue. Multiple sclerosis is a possibility, but it would be best to discuss this with her doctors and possibly consider further testing or evaluation if necessary.\n\nIn terms of her risk of having seizures again, it's difficult to predict with certainty. Seizure disorders can be complex and vary from person to person. It's important for her to continue taking her medication as prescribed and to follow up with her healthcare providers regularly to monitor her condition.\n\nIn the meantime, try to support your wife and encourage her to rest and take care of herself as best as she can. Remember to take care of yourself as well, as caring for a loved one during a challenging time can be emotionally taxing. Don't hesitate to reach out for support or additional guidance if needed."

        "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you may be experiencing a type of neurological phenomenon called an aura. Auras are sensory disturbances that can occur before a migraine or as a standalone experience. They can include symptoms such as tingling sensations, visual disturbances, and changes in perception. It's important to note that auras can vary widely from person to person and may not always be recognized as related to migraines.\n\nIf you continue to experience these sensations, it may be a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to explore potential treatment options. Keep track of when these episodes occur and any possible triggers that may be associated with them. This information can be helpful in identifying patterns and potential causes.\n\nIn the meantime, try to stay calm and rest if needed during these episodes. Stay hydrated and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle to help manage any potential triggers. Take care of yourself and reach out for support if needed."

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum.

        "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",

It's also important to prioritize self-care and stress management techniques to help reduce the frequency or severity of these episodes.\n\nI hope you are able to find some answers and relief soon.

        "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's important to talk to your psychiatrist about any side effects you are experiencing with the Vyvanse. They may be able to adjust your dosage or suggest a different medication that might work better for you. In the meantime, you can try some things to help alleviate the air hunger feeling. \n\nOne thing you can try is practicing deep breathing exercises. This can help you feel like you are getting more air with each breath. You can also try taking slow, deep breaths through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth. \n\nAnother thing that might help is staying hydrated. Drinking water regularly throughout the day can help with respiratory function and may alleviate the air hunger feeling.\n\nIt's also important to make sure you are getting enough sleep and taking care of your overall health. Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and practicing stress-reducing activities like meditation or yoga can all help improve your overall well-being.\n\nRemember, it's important to communicate openly with your healthcare providers about any side effects you are experiencing. They are there to help you find the best treatment plan for you."

It happened again last week and sometimes I do feel a bit drowsy or weird but haven't had a full on focal seizure again.What I experienced was:Nausea I saw an aura, or like static? on my right eye that then turned into colors.   My limbs went cold I had a deja vu sensation, like I started to think things I hadn't thought of in two years? I don't know how to explain it I lost all peripheral vision on my right eye for a good while.Speaking was difficult Almost lost consciousness (in 2020 I did lose consciousness and moved my eyes from side to side very rapidly and my face went droopy last time). Back then I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything. Since it never happened again I didn't go see a neurologist but the other day it happened twice so I immediately booked an appointment.",

        "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you have been dealing with a range of symptoms for several years, potentially related to food intolerances and anxiety. It may be helpful to keep a food diary to track which foods seem to trigger your symptoms, and consider discussing this with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to explore potential food sensitivities or allergies. \n\nAdditionally, given your history of AIWS, depersonalization, and panic attacks, it may be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional to address any underlying anxiety or stress that could be contributing to your symptoms. They can help you develop coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your anxiety and improve your overall well-being. \n\nIt's also important to continue monitoring your symptoms and discussing them with your healthcare provider, as they can help rule out any potential underlying medical conditions and provide appropriate treatment and support. Take care of yourself and prioritize your health and well-being."

I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is common for people to experience side effects from anti-seizure medications, including feeling foggy or drunk-like. It is important to talk to your doctor about any side effects you are experiencing. They may be able to adjust your dosage or try a different medication that works better for you.\n\nIn terms of when to take your medication, it is recommended to take Keppra at the same time each day to help maintain a consistent level of the drug in your system. It is generally ok to take Keppra with or without food, but if you find that taking it with food helps lessen the side effects, then that is fine to do. \n\nAs for taking it before bed, some people find that taking anti-seizure medications at night helps them better tolerate the side effects as they sleep through them. However, it is important to consult with your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.\n\nOverall, it is important to communicate openly with your healthcare provider about any side effects you are experiencing so they can help find the best treatment plan for you."

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

        "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

        "answer": "I am not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information about radiation exposure from CT scans. CT scans do expose patients to ionizing radiation, which can increase the risk of cancer in the long term. The actual risk depends on a variety of factors including the amount of radiation received, the age of the patient, and the specific body part being scanned. \n\nIt's difficult to directly compare your radiation exposure to other groups such as radiation workers, patients receiving radiation therapy, pilots, or survivors of erratic radiation exposure. Each of these groups has different levels of exposure and radiation sensitivity. In general, the risk of cancer from a few CT scans is considered low, especially if the scans were medically necessary for your diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIt's important to discuss any concerns you have about radiation exposure with your healthcare provider. They can help assess your individual risk and provide guidance on next steps. It's also important to focus on your recovery and health moving forward. Try to stay positive and take care of yourself. Remember, worrying about the past won't change anything \u2013 focus on the present and your future wellness."

        "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve in the body and plays a crucial role in the functioning of many organs in the body. It is responsible for controlling the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest and digest functions in the body. Stimulation of the vagus nerve has been shown to have various positive effects on health, including improving digestion, lowering blood pressure, reducing anxiety, and promoting overall well-being.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that stimulating the vagus nerve can indeed have these positive effects. Methods of stimulating the vagus nerve include deep breathing, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, and devices that deliver electrical stimulation to the nerve.\n\nWhile the benefits of vagus nerve stimulation are supported by research, it is important to note that it may not work for everyone and should not be considered a cure-all for all health issues. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any new treatment or therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may view the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve as exaggerated or \"bullshit,\" there is scientific evidence to support its positive effects on health. It may be worth exploring as a complementary therapy for various health conditions, but it is important to approach it with caution and consult with a healthcare provider."

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your symptoms and history, it does sound like temporal lobe epilepsy could be a possible explanation for your seizures. It's great that you have been proactive in researching and gathering information to better understand your condition. It's important to continue working with your neurologists to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, it may be helpful to keep track of your seizures and any triggers or patterns you notice. It's also important to make sure you are taking care of your overall health and well-being. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to discuss them with your healthcare providers. Best of luck on your journey towards better health."

        "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great that you have an appointment with a hematologist scheduled in June to further investigate your elevated eosinophil levels. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are typically involved in the body's immune response to parasites and allergens. However, in your case, it seems that there is no known cause for the elevated levels.\n\nGiven your medical history of epilepsy and the medications you are currently taking, it's possible that these medications may be contributing to the elevation in eosinophils. It's important to discuss this with your hematologist and neurologist to determine the possible link between your medications and the elevated levels.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to worry too much and focus on staying healthy and managing your epilepsy effectively. Keep track of any new symptoms or changes in your health and discuss them with your healthcare providers.\n\nOnce you have more information from your hematologist, you will have a better understanding of what may be causing the elevated eosinophil levels and what steps can be taken to address it. Stay proactive in your healthcare and continue to communicate openly with your healthcare team. \n\nTake care and best of luck with your upcoming appointment!"

        "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible that these \"flashes\" you're experiencing could be a form of epilepsy, specifically a type of focal seizure called a simple partial seizure. Simple partial seizures can cause various sensory experiences, such as ringing in the ears, visual distortions, or sudden feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider other potential causes for these experiences, such as migraines, anxiety, or even just normal variations in brain activity. Since your doctor doesn't seem concerned about it, it may be helpful to keep track of when these episodes occur, what triggers them, and any other symptoms you may experience during or after the \"flash\" to provide more information for a potential future discussion with your healthcare provider. \n\nIf you are still curious or concerned about these experiences, it might be worthwhile to seek a second opinion from a different doctor or a specialist, such as a neurologist, who may be able to provide more insight and potentially recommend further testing or evaluation. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to potential neurological issues."

I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about all the health challenges you are facing. It's definitely important to gather as much information as you can to better understand how these conditions may be interconnected.\n\n1) In terms of the connection between inflammation and epilepsy, there have been studies that suggest inflammation can play a role in the development and progression of epilepsy. Inflammatory processes in the brain can potentially trigger seizures, and there is also evidence showing that anti-inflammatory treatments can have a positive impact on epilepsy control. I would recommend speaking with your healthcare provider or a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy to learn more about the specific relationship between inflammation and epilepsy in your case.\n\n2) As for the connection between cysts and inflammation, there is some research suggesting that chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of certain types of cysts. For example, inflammation in the pancreas can lead to pancreatic cysts, and inflammation in the ovaries can lead to ovarian cysts. It's possible that the cysts throughout your body could be related to the chronic inflammation you are experiencing. I would recommend discussing this with your healthcare provider to see if further investigation or treatment may be necessary.\n\nIt's important to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your conditions and explore potential connections between them. Stay proactive and informed in your health journey, and don't hesitate to ask questions and seek additional information. Take care and best of luck on your healing journey."

        "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues.

My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions.

Absence seizures, for example, are considered a type of generalized seizure that usually lasts for a few seconds to half a minute and may not involve convulsions. \n\nIt\u2019s best to discuss your symptoms and concerns with a healthcare provider who can provide a thorough evaluation and potentially refer you to a neurologist for further assessment. They may also recommend additional tests or monitoring to help make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, try to focus on managing stress, getting enough sleep, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle as these factors can impact seizure activity. Remember that seeking professional medical advice is key in understanding and addressing your symptoms."

        "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great that you are proactive about your health and seeking medical advice. Folate and ferritin deficiencies can be caused by a variety of factors, not just poor diet. Some possible reasons for these deficiencies could include malabsorption issues, certain medications, genetic factors, or underlying health conditions. It's important to follow up with your doctor to determine the underlying cause of your deficiencies and to come up with a treatment plan.\n\nAs for the connection between folate and iron deficiency, they can sometimes coexist because both nutrients are essential for the production of red blood cells. If you are deficient in one, it can affect the production and functioning of red blood cells, which can lead to symptoms like fatigue and pale skin.\n\nIn terms of your epilepsy, it's best to discuss any concerns with your doctor. While there isn't a direct link between folate and ferritin deficiencies and epilepsy, it's always good to keep your healthcare providers informed about any changes in your health status. They can help determine if there are any potential interactions between your epilepsy medication and your nutrient deficiencies.\n\nOverall, it's important to continue to eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and follow any recommendations from your healthcare provider to address your deficiencies. Take care of yourself and continue to prioritize your health."

        "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information:\n\n1. It's possible for an EEG to show abnormal activity even after a seizure has occurred, as the brain's electrical signals may still be affected. It's not necessarily indicative of his usual brain activity.\n\n2. The abnormal EEG itself is unlikely to have affected his growth and mental development. It's more a reflection of the brain's activity during that particular test.\n\n3. It's always good to discuss with the doctors if you have concerns about underlying causes and whether an MRI is necessary to rule out any other issues.\n\n4. Every person reacts differently to medications, including Depakote. Some common side effects include behavior changes, hair loss, and liver toxicity. It's important to have regular check-ups with the doctor to monitor any potential side effects and adjust treatment if needed.\n\n5. It's best to discuss alternative treatment options like CBD with the neurologist before making any changes to the prescribed medication. They will have the expertise to advise on the best course of action for your son's condition.\n\n6. Getting a second or third opinion can be helpful in gaining more perspectives on the diagnosis and treatment plan. You can consider showing the EEG results to other neurologists for their input.\n\nRemember to always consult with medical professionals for personalized advice and treatment options for your son's condition."

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your accident and the ongoing pain you're experiencing. It's good that you've sought medical attention and are taking steps to manage your pain. Since you don't have the resources to see a doctor or get an x-ray right now, I would recommend continuing to take the prescribed anti-inflammatory steroids and using the menthol patches and analgesic cream for pain relief.\n\nIn terms of lung-related issues such as bruising or pleurisy, it's difficult to diagnose without a proper medical evaluation. However, if you are experiencing pressure around your heart and left lung, it's important to monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if they worsen or if you develop any new symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or coughing up blood.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to take care of yourself and rest as much as possible. Try to avoid any activities or movements that worsen your pain, and continue to use the pain relief methods recommended by your doctor. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for advice. Take care and I hope you feel better soon."

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",

        "answer": "I am sorry to hear about your girlfriend's medical condition. It sounds like she experienced a very serious and complex situation with her seizures.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is possible that the head to head movement your girlfriend exhibited could have been a type of seizure activity. The uncontrolled seizures, prolonged seizure activity, and abnormal EEG findings suggest that she may have been experiencing status epilepticus or a form of refractory epilepsy.\n\nGiven the extensive testing and treatments she has undergone, including the use of multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) like phenytoin, levetiracetam, and sodium valproate, along with prednisone and IVIG for brain inflammation, it seems like her medical team is doing their best to manage her condition. The addition of Vimpat may be necessary to help better control her seizures.\n\nIt is important to continue working closely with her healthcare providers and neurologist to monitor her condition and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan. It may also be helpful to seek a second opinion or consult with a specialist in epileptology to ensure she is receiving the best care possible.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to definitively determine the cause of her seizures without more information or a thorough examination. However, it is clear that she has a complex and challenging medical history, and ongoing support and medical care will be crucial in managing her condition effectively."

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart.

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up.

        "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

It's important to advocate for your mother and continue to seek answers and help from medical professionals.\n\nIn terms of possible causes for her symptoms, it's important to consider a few things. Firstly, the combination of medications she is on could be contributing to her cognitive decline. It's worth discussing this with her doctor and possibly getting a second opinion. It's also important to consider other underlying conditions that could be causing her symptoms, such as a neurological disorder or cognitive decline.\n\nWhen going to the doctor, it would be helpful to bring a detailed list of her symptoms, when they started, and any patterns you have noticed. It would also be helpful to bring a list of all the medications she is currently taking, including dosages and frequency. Additionally, bringing up the possibility of Alzheimer's and discussing the family history could be important. \n\nIt's also important to ensure that she is getting regular check-ups and monitoring her overall health. If she is not already, it may be helpful to have her see a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nIt's understandable that you are feeling anxious and scared about the future, but it's important to take care of yourself as well. It may be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor to help you manage your anxiety and fears. Remember that it's okay to focus on your own well-being while also supporting your mother.\n\nI wish you and your family strength and hope for answers and improvement in your mother's health."

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible that the valproic acid was affecting your daughter's cognitive and social abilities in some way. Valproic acid is known to have various side effects, including cognitive impairment and potentially affecting mood. It's also possible that the medication was dulling her senses or affecting her overall cognitive functioning in some way.\n\nIt's not uncommon for medications to have unexpected effects on individuals, especially when dealing with complex conditions like epilepsy and developmental disorders. It's also possible that as your daughter has grown and developed, her brain chemistry and response to medications have changed.\n\nIt's great to hear that your daughter has shown improvements in her communication and social skills since discontinuing the valproic acid. It's possible that the medication was actually hindering her progress in these areas. However, it's important to continue monitoring her behavior and working closely with her healthcare providers to ensure that she is receiving the appropriate care and support she needs. If you have concerns about her mood swings or any other behavioral changes, it's important to discuss them with her neurologist or another healthcare provider."

I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can try to provide some information based on the language used in the letter. \"Spike and wave discharges\" are abnormal electrical activities in the brain that are often associated with epilepsy. The fact that these discharges were noted in the right frontotemporal and central regions of your brain may indicate a specific area where the abnormal activity is occurring.\n\nIt's important to note that experiencing spike and wave discharges does not necessarily mean that a seizure will occur during the recording. It's possible to have abnormal electrical activity in the brain without outwardly visible symptoms.\n\nI would recommend following up with your neurologist to discuss the results of the EEG and any potential implications for your treatment or management of your partial seizures. They will be able to provide more specific information and guidance based on your individual situation."

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

It sounds like you are in a difficult situation, but there may be some options available to you.\n\nFirst, regarding your eligibility for medical insurance, it might be worth looking into Medi-Cal, which is California's Medicaid program. This program provides free or low-cost health coverage to low-income individuals and families. You can visit the Covered California website to see if you qualify or contact a local enrollment specialist for assistance.\n\nAs for Medicare, it is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities. If you have a disability that prevents you from working, you may be eligible for Medicare. It would be best to consult with a healthcare professional or a social worker to determine your eligibility and the necessary documentation required.\n\nRegarding the $5000 bill from the ER visit, it may be worth reaching out to the hospital's financial assistance department to see if they have any charity care programs or payment plans available to help reduce or eliminate the cost. They may be able to work with you to find a solution that fits your current financial situation.\n\nAdditionally, reaching out to a county worker or a social worker for assistance with navigating the healthcare system and accessing resources may be beneficial. They may be able to provide guidance on available programs and options for your specific situation.\n\nIt is important to prioritize your health and seek the necessary medical care, even if it feels overwhelming.

        "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",

        "answer": "It sounds like you are experiencing a complex medical situation and it is important that you discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider. Non-epileptic seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), can be triggered by psychological stress or trauma and may present with symptoms similar to epilepsy. It is possible for someone experiencing PNES to have an aura before the seizure, as the brain can still generate similar sensations. However, a thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider, potentially including a neurologist or epilepsy specialist, is needed to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. Being aware of the possibility of PNES and discussing it with your healthcare provider can help in getting the proper diagnosis and management. Remember to keep track of your symptoms, triggers, and any changes in your condition to provide your healthcare provider with a clear picture of what is happening."

Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3.

Given your history of epilepsy and the seizures you experienced as a child, it would be advisable to consult with a neurologist to better understand the long-term consequences of these seizures and determine if they may be contributing to your current symptoms.\n\nA comprehensive evaluation by a neuropsychologist could also be beneficial in determining the extent to which your difficulties may be related to PTSD or potential cognitive deficits resulting from your seizure history. Neuropsychological testing can help identify specific areas of cognitive impairment and provide recommendations for treatment and support.\n\nIn terms of the stellate ganglion block for PTSD, it may be worth discussing this option with a pain management specialist at the pain center. They can provide more information on the procedure and how it could potentially help with your PTSD symptoms.\n\nUltimately, a multidisciplinary approach involving collaboration between a neurologist, neuropsychologist, and pain management specialist may be most beneficial in addressing your complex medical history and current symptoms. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being, so don't hesitate to seek out the appropriate medical professionals to help you navigate these challenges."

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question.My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures.My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic EpilepsyDrugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 1000mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed.Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety.",

        "answer": "I am not a doctor, but it is always important to consult with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen, especially when considering starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT can potentially interact with certain medications, including anti-epileptic drugs like Depakote and Keppra, which can affect their effectiveness.\n\nYour healthcare provider will be able to determine if there are any potential interactions between your epilepsy medications and HRT, and provide guidance on how to proceed. It is important to discuss your concerns about the potential increase in seizures with your healthcare provider so they can provide you with the best possible care and recommendations.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to keep a seizure diary to track any changes in seizure activity, triggers, and medication effects, which can provide valuable information for your healthcare provider to assess your condition and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan."

        "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",

        "answer": "It sounds like you are going through a very difficult time. It's important to remember that everyone's experience with epilepsy can be different and it is possible for the condition to change over time. It's also not uncommon for epilepsy to be difficult to diagnose and treat.\n\nGiven your worsening symptoms, it may be a good idea to seek a second opinion from a different doctor or to consider seeing a specialist in epilepsy. They may be able to offer different treatment options or provide a fresh perspective on your diagnosis.\n\nIn addition to seeking medical help, it may also be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor to help you cope with the emotional impact of your condition. It's important to take care of your mental health as well as your physical health.\n\nRemember that you are not alone in this and there are resources and support available to help you through this challenging time.

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",

        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing fainting episodes and the frustration you're feeling with your doctors not providing a clear answer. It sounds like you've been through a lot and have been proactively managing your health with the advice given to you.\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and the fact that they seem to be worsening, it's a good idea to consult with a neurologist to explore other possible causes beyond just the cardiac aspect. It's possible that your fainting episodes could be related to temporal lobe epilepsy or hormonal imbalances, as you mentioned. \n\nIn the meantime, continue to track your symptoms, triggers, and any patterns you notice. This information can be helpful in providing more insights to your neurologist. It's also important to prioritize your safety, especially during episodes, by making sure you are in a safe position and letting someone know when you are feeling unwell.\n\nIt's understandable to feel frustrated and anxious while waiting for your appointment, but try to stay positive and continue to advocate for yourself. Keep an open line of communication with your healthcare providers and express any concerns or new symptoms that arise. \n\nI hope you can find some comfort and answers soon.

I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went..

        "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "First of all, it's great that you have already seen multiple specialists to rule out any serious conditions that could be causing your fainting episodes. Since they have not found any specific medical reasons for your fainting, it's possible that it could be related to a vasovagal response, which is a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure that can lead to fainting. This can be triggered by a variety of factors, including dehydration, heat, stress, and lack of blood flow to the brain.\n\nIn terms of prevention, it sounds like you are already taking some good steps like wearing compression socks, avoiding coffee and alcohol, and staying hydrated. Eating salty snacks or meals leading up to and during the flight can also help maintain your blood pressure. It might also be helpful to bring some sugary snacks or drinks with you on the flight to quickly boost your blood sugar if you start feeling dizzy.\n\nIn addition, it could be beneficial to try practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage any anxiety you may have about flying. Anxiety and stress can exacerbate fainting episodes, so finding ways to stay calm and relaxed during the flight could be helpful.\n\nLastly, if you continue to experience fainting episodes, it may be worth discussing with your doctor the possibility of getting a tilt table test or a Holter monitor to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure during a fainting episode. This could help provide more insight into what may be triggering your fainting episodes and potentially lead to more targeted treatment options.\n\nOverall, it's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself during flights, especially during long-haul flights where you may be more susceptible to fainting. Hopefully, with some additional preventative measures and self-care strategies, you can enjoy your upcoming flight with minimal anxiety and worry about fainting."

        "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",

        "answer": "It's possible that there could be a connection between your epilepsy and changes in energy levels, as well as potential underlying health issues such as autoimmune disease or leaky gut. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional who specializes in epilepsy and possibly a nutritionist or holistic practitioner to explore these possibilities further. Keep advocating for yourself and seeking answers that make sense to you, even if others may not immediately understand or validate your experiences. Your health and well-being are worth the effort to uncover any potential connections and address them appropriately."

Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be?

        "question": "30 AFAB, 158cm/61kg, hispanic, Symptoms: lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods. flu-ish [see below] since a month ago.Diagnoses: Epilepsy, ADHD, Endometriosis, 5cm ovarian cyst, migrainesMedications: Lamotrigine 225mg, Ibuprofen for endometriosis pain, very occasional Concerta, haven't used it for a few months, melatonin over the summer (stopped it about two months ago)Others: Drink 1-2 drinks monthly, Slowly stopping smoking down from 6 to 1-2 per day and 1 light snus, last two days have started taking Vitamin D and I have been using a therapy lamp for 20 min every morning for the last two weeks. Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are a few red flags that you should watch out for:\n\n1. Increasing lightheadedness and fatigue: If these symptoms persist or worsen, it could be a sign of anemia or other underlying health issues, such as thyroid problems.\n\n2. Darker urine: This could indicate dehydration or liver issues. If your urine remains consistently dark despite increased water intake, it could be a sign of a more serious problem.\n\n3. Changes in menstrual cycle: Lighter periods and spotting could be a sign of hormonal imbalances or other gynecological issues, especially given your history of endometriosis and ovarian cysts.\n\n4. Increasing ovarian pain: If the pain in your ovary is getting worse and is accompanied by other symptoms like nausea and increased hunger, it's important to have it checked out by a healthcare provider to rule out any complications from the cyst.\n\n5. Recurrent flu-like symptoms: Constantly feeling like you are catching a flu, along with frequent cold symptoms, could be a sign of a weakened immune system or underlying infection.\n\nGiven your family history of cancer and the fact that several of your symptoms are concerning, it would be best to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your concerns and undergo further evaluation. It's important to listen to your body and seek medical attention when needed, especially when dealing with ongoing health issues like epilepsy, endometriosis, and migraines. Take care of yourself and prioritize your health."

        "question": "I\u2019m (40F) 5ft 8, 164lbs, caucasian. Medications: Lamotrigine and Sertraline Health conditions: ADHD, Tourette\u2019s, epilepsy and severe degenerative disc disease. I don\u2019t have a current issue but every time I\u2019ve had surgery I wake up completely full of beans, even when I\u2019ve just woken up in recovery. I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can\u2019t stop giggling. I don\u2019t feel sick at all and always want water and food immediately. Drs/nurses etc have commented it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even have surgery, but I\u2019ve never asked if there\u2019s a reason why. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I\u2019ve never been told I\u2019m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you may have a unique response to anesthesia and pain medications, which could be related to your underlying health conditions and medications you are taking. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to metabolize drugs differently, resulting in varying responses to anesthesia and pain medications.\n\nYour heightened energy and lack of pain sensitivity after surgery could possibly be due to the effects of the anesthesia or pain medications on your neurotransmitter levels. It's also possible that your body processes these medications differently, leading to a faster recovery and reduced pain sensation.\n\nIt's important to communicate your experiences with your healthcare providers before any future surgeries so they can adjust your anesthesia and pain management plan accordingly. They may also consider alternative medications or dosage adjustments based on your unique response.\n\nIt's always a good idea to discuss any concerns or unusual responses to medications with your healthcare provider to ensure you receive the best care possible."

        "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through all of this. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of different symptoms and it can be really frustrating when they all seem to be happening at once. It's possible that the stomach pain and discomfort you're experiencing could be related to your medication, changes in your diet, or even stress and anxiety.\n\nIt's always a good idea to talk to your doctor about any new or worsening symptoms, especially if they're affecting your daily life. They can help you determine the cause of your stomach issues and recommend the best course of action. In the meantime, continue to avoid triggers like spicy foods and caffeine, and try to manage your stress and anxiety as best you can.\n\nAs for your late period, irregular periods can be common for some individuals, but it's also worth mentioning to your doctor, especially if it's causing you concern. They can help determine if there may be an underlying medical reason for the irregularity.\n\nOverall, taking care of your physical and mental health is important, so don't hesitate to reach out for support and guidance. Take care of yourself and I hope you start feeling better soon."

        "question": "Gender: Female, Age: 9, Height: Idk tbh, Location: Head, How long ago: 1 week.So my co-workers daughter was just diagnosed with grey matter heterotopia. She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren\u2019t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your co-worker's daughter's diagnosis. Grey matter heterotopia is a rare neurological condition where a person's brain develops abnormal clusters of grey matter in the wrong location. It can cause seizures and other neurological issues.\n\nTreatment options for grey matter heterotopia typically include medications to control seizures, and in some cases, surgery may be recommended to remove the abnormal tissue. It's important for your co-worker to consult with the doctor and discuss the best treatment plan for her daughter.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important for your co-worker to know that she is not alone in this journey. There are support groups and resources available for families dealing with similar conditions, where they can find guidance, comfort, and information.\n\nIt's wonderful that you want to support your co-worker during this difficult time. Simply being there to listen, offering a shoulder to lean on, and showing your care and compassion can make a big difference. Your presence and support can bring some light into their lives during this challenging period."

        "question": "25F, 200lb, 5\u20194, asthma, current medications wellbutrin SR, vyvanse, lexapro, montelukast, spironolactone. i do not drink any alcohol, use cannabis 5-7x a weekOccasionally, I will have an intense sensation of deja vu, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as disoriented. It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you may be experiencing a type of aura, which can be a symptom of certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy or migraines. Auras are often described as feelings of deja vu, disorientation, dizziness, confusion, and nausea, and can sometimes be followed by other symptoms, such as headaches or fatigue.\n\nGiven your history of asthma and current medications, it may be worth discussing these symptoms with a healthcare provider to rule out any potential underlying medical issues. They may recommend further evaluation, such as neurological testing or imaging, to determine the cause of these episodes.\n\nIn the meantime, keeping a journal of when these episodes occur, any triggers or patterns you notice, and any other symptoms you experience may help provide valuable information for your healthcare provider. It's always important to prioritize your health and seek professional medical advice if you have any concerns or unusual symptoms."

        "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It is possible that the weight lifting and strain on the body during workouts could be affecting the vagus nerve, which plays a role in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. In individuals with GERD and a hiatal hernia, there may be additional pressure on the vagus nerve due to the positioning of the stomach and esophagus.\n\nWhen the vagus nerve is affected, it can lead to symptoms such as lightheadedness, fainting, and potentially seizure-like episodes. It is important to discuss this possibility with your healthcare provider and explore potential strategies to alleviate strain on the vagus nerve during workouts, such as modifying the intensity or type of exercise, ensuring proper hydration, and maintaining stability during weight lifting.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to consider alternative treatments or lifestyle changes to manage your GERD and decrease reliance on long-term PPI use, as these medications may also have potential side effects that can impact neurological symptoms. It is important to work closely with your healthcare team to address your symptoms and determine the best course of action for managing your condition."

Current diagnoses: epilepsy, mild chronic pancreatitis Regular medications are: AM: 500mg Kepra, vitamins D+magnesium PM: 500mg Kepra, vitamin D+magnesium I am awaiting follow-up with a gastroenterologist about why my pancreas could be nibbling on itself (lypase has been found to be between 70-100 on multiple occasions). I have a history of treating my anxiety with alcohol and fast food but over the last 8 years or so (since my early 20's) I've gone to therapy and gotten it really well under control. I never had these symptoms before when I had unhealthy habits but over the last year my pancreas has not been having a good time. Every month or 2 I get these very specific pains that I now know is mild chronic pancreatitis. It's never brought on by a change in routine, it's always random.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of mild chronic pancreatitis and the fact that you are awaiting follow-up with a gastroenterologist, it's important to continue to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and management of your condition. It's also important to continue managing your anxiety in a healthy way, such as through therapy and other coping mechanisms.\n\nIn terms of your diet and lifestyle, it's great that you have made positive changes over the years to improve your overall health. It's important to continue to follow a healthy diet, such as incorporating lean meats and vegetables into your meals and choosing nutritious options like fruit smoothies for breakfast. Limiting your alcohol consumption is also important, as alcohol can exacerbate pancreatitis.\n\nMake sure to take your medications as prescribed and discuss any concerns or questions with your healthcare provider. Keep track of any symptoms you experience and discuss them with your healthcare provider during your follow-up appointments. It's important to stay proactive in managing your health and working with your healthcare team to address any concerns or issues that may arise."
