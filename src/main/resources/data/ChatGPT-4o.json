        "answer": "The first-line treatment for a mild depressive episode in patients with both epilepsy and depression includes **psychotherapy** (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** like sertraline or citalopram, which have a lower risk of worsening seizures. Avoid antidepressants that lower the seizure threshold, such as bupropion. Managing epilepsy properly also helps improve mood.**References:**1. Kanner AM, et al.
