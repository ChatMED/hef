First, confirm both diagnoses! Treatment usually involves a combination of **antidepressants** (SSRIs/SNRIs, cautiously started), and **antipsychotics** (often atypical, like quetiapine or risperidone) to address both depression *and* psychosis. **Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)** need careful review \u2013 some can worsen depression. **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)** is highly effective and often preferred, as it impacts both conditions with fewer drug interactions. \n\nEssentially, we balance mood *and* seizure control.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nPsychotic depression means someone experiences both severe depression *and* breaks with reality (hallucinations/delusions). Epilepsy adds a layer of complexity because some seizure/epilepsy medications can influence mood, and some depression/psychosis medications can potentially lower the seizure threshold (make seizures more likely).
