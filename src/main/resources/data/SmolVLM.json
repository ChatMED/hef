But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",

    "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",

    "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nThe information you have provided is not sufficient to diagnose epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed based on the presence of two or more seizures, which are defined as a sudden onset of a seizure that lasts for more than a few minutes, or a seizure that causes a loss of consciousness or a change in the normal state of awareness. A seizure can be caused by a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, stroke, head injury, brain tumors, and infections.\n\nAn EEG (electroencephalogram) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain. It is used to diagnose epilepsy, as well as other conditions such as brain tumors, infections, and stroke. An EEG can detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain that is not visible on a standard brain scan.\n\nAn MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It is used to diagnose conditions such as brain tumors, infections, and stroke.\n\nIf your husband has been diagnosed with epilepsy, it is important to understand that epilepsy is a chronic condition that can be managed with medication. It is not a life-threatening condition, but it can be difficult to manage.\n\nIf you have any further questions about epilepsy or your husband's condition, please feel free to ask."

    "question": "My partner (20M) has been having these \u2018seizure-like\u2019 behaviours for as long as he can remember (so assuming his whole life). There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",

It is a seizure-like event where he will get very stiff and his body will be completely still for a few seconds, and his eyes will be completely closed.

He is not on any medication and has no other medical issues.\n\nI am worried about this as it is concerning and i don\u2019t know what it is. I am also worried about the fact that he doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s doing it and doesn\u2019t understand why people are upset when he does it. I am also worried about the fact that he doesn\u2019t understand why he does it and doesn\u2019t know how to stop it.

    "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out.

Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a \u2018we\u2019re worried you may have a seizure while donating\u2019 kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it\u2019s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn\u2019t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can\u2019t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",

    "question": "My friend is 19 and pregnant. She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",

Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",

In the morning I take the 200mg pill with my breakfast fine, but when I take the 500mg tablet after dinner, I swallow the tablet with water like in the morning, I'm coughing up the water and the pill is getting lodged in my throat. This has been happening every other day in the last 2 weeks.I'm coughing up phelgmn and I've tried warm water to force the pill down as it is a enteric-coated pill, which reacts with water straight away. The longer the pill stays in my throat, it scrapes my throat and blood comes out with my spit. My throat is sore afterwards which takes two days to recover. I have to take my Epilepsy pills for life.I'm afraid to keep taking the 500ml tablets in the evening, as I keep having this reaction.Should I take 5 of the 200mg pills instead to make up the 1000mg required in the evening which are easier to swallow or do something else?I'm going to speak to my pharmacist and GP tomorrow morning as well about it.",

It started with me just getting vertigo in 2019 and it went away with medication but came back within a week and i got chest pains and went to see a cardiologist and everything was okay. I was then sent to a neurologist and they finally diagnosed me with epilepsy but I don't have seizures. for awhile though i was having episodes of \"falling into the ground\" feelings and if i was in the car it would feel like i was falling back. I would just get odd feelings like that. i was told i basically have micro seizures. there's times where i get dizzy and don't feel good or just don't feel right and im guessing it could just be depersonalization but I'm honestly not sure. l've been now struggling with a migraine for over a month now and i had a mri done that came out normal and im having another one and a mra done tomorrow to see if something looks off.

    "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",

    "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",

I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",

    "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",

    "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",

    "question": "My little sister, age 12, was diagnosed with epilepsy for the last 1 year. She has been taking necessary medications for its cure and prevention. However, she has been ill for the last few days and we ran a few tests waiting to get reports tomorrow. It's 3am now and she has been acting and moving her body weirdly while sleeping for the last hour, we're suspecting she's having nocturnal epilepsy. Moreover, she has been telling us she feels tremor in her stomach for the past 3 days. It would be really nice if anyone could answer the following questions    What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?    What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",

    "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this?

    "question": "I\u2019m a 22 year old female and I have quite a track sheet of medical issues. I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m not sure if they are related and I really don\u2019t know which road to go down.I\u2019ve had ruptured ovarian cysts consistently since I was 12. every time I ovulate. I\u2019ve been on birth control since I was 13 because of that. I have insanely painful periods and I know my hormones are out of wack but I\u2019ve never been diagnosed officially with PCOS or endometriosis but I think I could have either one. not sure.I got diagnosed with epilepsy last February after two grand mal seizures on the same day. coincidentally(?) I had just gotten off birth control to try and heal my body naturally. my seizures seem to align with my menstrual cycle. I\u2019m on Keppra and it\u2019s controlling my tonic clonic seizures but I have breakthrough absence seizures 3x a week. originally my first EEG only showed right temporal lobe seizures but my most recent EEG showed right and left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe seizures.while I was in the epilepsy monitoring unit last week for a 7 day EEG during a pretty intense grand mal seizure my heart rate hit 275 bpm. I\u2019ve always felt little heart flutters but this was intense. I have a Holter monitor now, and I was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. I\u2019m getting an ablation next week. the flutters happen after every seizure but sometimes just on their own without seizure activity.can someone please help me connect the dots, or point me in the direction of someone who can help?

Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",

    "question": "Currently on no medications, BW is normal other than some minor indication of anemia and malnourishment (low folate, hemotacrit, hemoglobin, vitamin d, sodium) high albumin.Family history of a wide variety of mental health conditions as well as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycistic kidneys.Began approximately 4 years ago. Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs. Also have had gastrointestinal issues which i\u2019m not sure if they are relevant or not: nausea and stomach pain after eating anything. Have had some issues with UTI\u2019s. All doctors I have visited have told me there is nothing wrong and make me feel as if they just believe i\u2019m looking for free pills(or a hypochrondiac) but I am still having these issues so i\u2019m not sure where to go from here. pls help",

I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",

    "answer": "\nHi,\n\nI am not a doctor, but I can tell you that this sounds like a seizure. It is possible that you have a condition called \"benign essential blepharospasm\", which is a type of epilepsy that affects the muscles around the eyes.\n\nI would recommend talking to your doctor about your symptoms and getting a referral to a neurologist. The neurologist can perform a thorough evaluation and determine if you have a seizure disorder. If you do have a seizure disorder, there are treatments available that can help you manage your symptoms.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

Currently taking : Lamictal 400mg Fluoxetine 10mg Omeprazole 40mg Gabapentin 300mg 3x day as needed Vitamin D DX : Bipolar type 2 Social phobia (not sure exactly how my psych phrased it) Anxiety Abdominal epilepsy Acid reflux Tobacco (on/off), marijuana use, almost never drink or use any other drugs. I will do my best to be brief. I have had serious mental health issues since I was a child. First suicide attempt was at 7. Institutionalized at 15 for suicidal ideation, and have had therapy since then. I restarted medications at 21. I have had a lot of bad experiences with medical professionals. Very abusive docs when institutionalized. My last doctor told me to treat my bipolar disorder with a multivitamin. The doctor before prescribed me an anti depressant, had a manic episode, then changed to lamictal 100mg. He also called me a drug seeker because I wanted muscle relaxers to treat a weird medical episode that was causing severe neck pain. This turned out to be abdominal epilepsy. I have used urgent cares on rare occasion to get antibiotics, etc. But I haven't had a pcp since I was 20. How can I find a PCP that is comfortable working with mental health patients? What do I need to have done to get on track? I am aware that I am extremely high risk for suicide, between bipolar, loss of a sibling to suicide, childhood sexual abuse. I feel it's more important than ever to get a grip on my physical health so I can have a long life with my wife and my parents, and live to take care of them in their golden years. Currently see a therapist and a psych for med management. I'm also working with my therapist now to work through my problems with seeking medical care. Any other questions I am happy to ask.",

    "question": "Age: 21 Sex: Female (But I go by He/Him) Height: 5'3 Weight: 106lbsOver the past few months I've been seeing a psychiatrist and she's put me on numerous pills. The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been.

    "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",

    "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",

    "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",

My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had.

    "question": "I am not a doctor, but I know my body and I am no fool. I also try to avoid going to the doctor unless necessary, so I try to make sure I have to go before I do. My doctors tend to mark me up to either being a hypochondriac or having drug seeking behaviour.For example: I have very severe epilepsy, and the Keppra I am on is no longer working; I am having multiple seizures in a row every month along with, almost constant myoclonic jerks in my legs. I asked my doctor to please change me from the Keppra about 6 months ago, when it first started showing signs of no longer working. Last month I had 9 focal-to-generalized seizures without becoming aware between them.In short, pharmaceutical companies tell me to ask my doctor about certain meds, but when I do, they blow me off.Bonus Question: What do you recommend for these seizures? They are almost always triggered by hormones, stress level, and being asleep.Thanks in advance!",

    "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",

    "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

    "question": "Not sure if this is allowed- (20F/medical MJ patient/white) I've been trying to get this figured out for YEARS now, no one takes me seriously. Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",

    "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

    "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy\u2014frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",

    "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",

    "question": "i\u2019m currently living with my mom 60F who has had epilepsy for the past 30-ish years. i\u2019ve noticed her memory is declining, especially in the past year or so. it\u2019s not to the point where there could be any sort of formal diagnosis given but it\u2019s starting to concern me. i\u2019ve done some research into the correlation between epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s (or dementia in general) and from what i\u2019ve gathered the strongest correlation is between focal epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s due to the damage to the temporal lobe. my mom has tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) and i\u2019ve been trying to find information on how much her seizures affect the temporal lobe, but i can\u2019t find much and i think that\u2019s partially due to the lack of research. i don\u2019t know who to ask or talk to about this. i don\u2019t want to scare my mom but i\u2019ve scoured google trying to find more information but i can\u2019t seem to find anything. i just have so many questions\u2026is 60 too early to tell? once her memory starts to decline, how long does she have still being lucid? do grand mal seizures damage the temporal lobe in the same way focal seizures do? if that is what\u2019s happening, how do i make her feel loved and comfortable? examples of her memory issues: forgetting what she\u2019s talking about mid sentence (a lot). forgetting the names of people/places/things that she knows well. misplacing/forgetting objects fairly frequently, etc. i don\u2019t except anyone to know all the answers, but any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.EDIT: i understand with age there\u2019s usually going to be some forgetfulness, but this seems excessive to me. i\u2019m obviously not a professional, just a paranoid daughter, but my father is older and his memory is far better. also, more background: 60F, 5\u20192, 120lbs, past history of estrogen binding cancer (has had double mastectomy + hysterectomy); she fractured her neck following a seizure in 2017? i\u2019m not sure which vertebre, but she\u2019s made a full recovery. also she\u2019s had her left? hip replaced and currently suffers with nerve pain. on my maternal side, there\u2019s a lot of history of mental illness (including: BP-1 & 2, schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, major depression, BPD, ASPD, anxiety & panic disorders & some substance abuse - mostly heroin and meth) my mom is only formally diagnosed with clinical depression, and is on medication for both the epilepsy as well as depression. medications include lexapro & lamotrigine (she also briefly was using \"speed\" which she swears wasn\u2019t meth but there\u2019s a good chance it was)",

There were white spots on my brain but maybe that was migraines.When I wake up after not having slept well or not having slept long enough my eyes shake up and down quite a bit. It lasts for a few minutes until I'm up and moving around. Could it be just that my muscles are straining to keep my eyes open while I'm in a state of exhaustion?

He diagnosed me with absence seizures but the problem is I\u2019ve never forgotten a seizure or lost consciousness. Now I\u2019m realising that what he\u2019s called my \u2018motor tics\u2019 could be seizures as well. Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I\u2019m off my meds. But the past week I haven\u2019t really been sleeping and I\u2019ve had the flu and I\u2019ve been unable to twitch and it\u2019s like the feeling is building up in the back of my head and its getting really uncomfortable and making it sometimes hard to breathe. Sometimes painful. The feeling is completely involuntary, kind of like a sneeze, and it feels like when you can\u2019t sneeze. What should I do? My neurologist doesn\u2019t listen to me. I have a GP appointment in 2 days, should I talk to her about it?",

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse. So uh\u2026 yeah.Thoughts? Feelings? I briefly caught part of it on video, but have no idea how to post that here.I greatly appreciate any input.",

    "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nThe tremors in your son are likely to be due to a condition called \"benign essential tremor.\" This is a common neurological disorder that affects the way the brain controls movement. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence, but it can also begin in adulthood. The tremors are usually mild and do not interfere with daily activities.\n\nThe shaking of the head and eyes is not normal. It could be a sign of a different condition, such as a migraine or a seizure. If the tremors are severe or if they are accompanied by other symptoms, it is best to consult a neurologist for a proper diagnosis.\n\nBenign essential tremor is a common neurological disorder that affects the way the brain controls movement.

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",

    "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",

I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",

    "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with EA2 after an unexpected hospital stay. Of course I have been researching the condition, and came across 4-AP. I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won\u2019t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn\u2019t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",

    "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ? I feel flooded by these emotions, I cry.Then it took like 15 minutes to come back to normal, I am in a very confused state and go back to sleep.Any idea what was that ?",

    "question": "(20F) 5\u20193\u201d 134lbs Drink/Smoke occasionally, every other day Zyrtec, south asianThis has been a daily issue for ~ a decade. I sleep and wake up about the same times. I pee 2-4 times in the night even if I don\u2019t drink after 9:30pm.Sometimes I can feel myself \u201cshutting down\u201d, or falling asleep and my body starting to paralyze. I hear crazy noises (exploding head syndrome). Mostly 1-3 times i am in a dream and cannot move my body at all. Feels like a magnet is preventing me from moving my head left to right. I\u2019m crying and screaming to lift a finger.It is so exhausting. I wake up fatigued and usually anxious. My brain fools me into thinking I\u2019m free the first time, but then I\u2019m paralyzed again. This is normal dreams + nightmares.I have major depression and anxiety. I heard that epilepsy can make you feel paralyzed in your sleep, and have trouble with memory. I have short-term memory loss past few years. I never have bruises or anything though. Please help!",

    "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",

    "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",

    "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",

I could feel a very tender lump right where the occipital lymph node is (thanks google!) I did palpate it a lot, and it is extremely painful today. I was also up all night with an awful migraine (first one in months since I started Aimovig) and it spread to my entire head and it was 8/10 pain. I do not have a fever. My headache is better when upright and has gotten a bit better throughout the day but the very painful bulge is still there. It also hurts at rest in that area. I felt lethargic and drained this morning.Took a covid test. Negative. Worried I have an infection or something but no fever? I have a big, painful and possible infected spit of cystic acne on my right cheek. Not sure if related.I\u2019ve also been having bad muscular pain on the right side of my shoulder after packing and lifting boxes, it kept me up thursday night. But it got better-ish. Not sure if it\u2019s related. Kinda feels worse today.Should I be concerned? It hurts to turn my head/move my head at alland I know that if I lie down my headache would return. If i even brush the lymph node it hurts so much. Was hard to brush my hair.Any insight appreciated.

    "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",

    "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can\u2019t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can\u2019t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it\u2019s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can\u2019t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",

I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

    "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",

    "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",

    "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",

    "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",

Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",

This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",

    "question": "A few years back while In the military I had a freak accident until it stopped being that and continued to occur day after day. After some months I was diagnosed with epilepsy.In the beginning I was having 1-3 seizures a day while 2-4 of those were grand mal seizures a month. Medications didn\u2019t work and just seemed to make everything worse so my neurologist made the decision to not give me medications after having tried 5 of them.It\u2019s been a few years now and nowadays I get anywhere from 2-5? Every 4months and about 2 or 3 of those are grand mal seizures. A significant decrease but still ongoing. We never found a cause for the seizures.Well I\u2019m asking because a few months back I started noticing a few things that started worrying me. For example,    a few years back and at the beginning of this I used to be \u201csmart\u201d as in I could write any word no matter how big or small but in recent months I\u2019ve noticed I have a really hard time writing, as in spelling out words. I used to full on turn on autocorrect on my phone but nowadays I find myself almost completely depending on my phones autocorrect and looking up word spellings when even my phone can\u2019t tell what I\u2019m trying to say.    with writing again, for some reason I find myself forgetting or I don\u2019t know, not using simple words such as \u201cthe\u201d \u201cof\u201d \u201cto\u201d \u201cand\u201d \u201cfrom\u201d etc. or sometimes mistaking one word for another when there\u2019s no connection between the two    same thing as above but with speech. I never had any speed impediment or any speech disorder prior but now I find myself getting \u201cstuck\u201d while trying to say a word. It\u2019s to the point where it\u2019ll happen at least once with every full sentence I try to speak. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ll see it happening and I\u2019ll try to say the word again and I won\u2019t be able to, I\u2019ll need to dramatically slow down my speech and literally say it in segments    dramatic increase in repeatedly forgetting. I\u2019ll forget my keys, go back and get them, get there and forget what I was going to get or sometimes I\u2019ll forget I forgot.

In the picture you see two on my left side, there can be another one on the left tip and the same can be mirrored on the right side. The most I had at the same time were 3 of these. They are painful, especially on contact (when eating); it's a burning sensation most of the time. They start small, get bigger and then develop a white \"ring\" instead of the red (in the photo), after this state the tongue gets white and the whole mouth has an unpleasant taste. But I would actually say I have good oral hygiene. Could this be related to one of my diseases, or could it be a side effect or something completely unrelated? I've already asked one of my doctors but he had no idea what this could be (out of his field). Which doctor would you suggest visiting, a dermatologist? I'm hoping to find someone here to help me out. I would be thankful for any ideas about what this might be, how to reduce the pain (except for standard painkillers) or to prevent it completely.

    "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",

    "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",

    "question": "42 F Lamictal, cymbalta, singulair, levothyroxine, Pepcid, ambien 200lbs (significant weight gain in 3 years after injury to cervical spine - unable to run like I used to so I\u2019m confident that is the main reason why) 3-4 drinks per year, past prescription drug use (all prescribed but over used/abused) no addictive medications for almost 2 years besides ambien but now I\u2019m very careful. Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a seizure but it\u2019s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it\u2019s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. Thanks to all the doctors who visit this sub and offer help!",

    "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

    "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",

    "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",

    "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing. Could that be something that is going on? I was just curious! This doesn\u2019t really negatively impact my life, it just causes me to get some weird looks sometimes.Details: 23F, 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs, Caucasian, acid cravings, existing medical issues (Migraines, IST, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation), medications (verapamil and singulair), no drugs, sparingly drink, no smoking.",

    "question": " I\u2019m 19F about 5\u20193\u201d not sure about my weight but quite small from the UK.So, in the past, I\u2019ve had what I believe to be 3 tonic-clonic seizures. I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don\u2019t feel quite normal at the moment and I\u2019m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it\u2019s my first ever post on Reddit and I\u2019m just very confused about what\u2019s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",

    "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",

    "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",

I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress.

    "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nThe text is a description of an unusual event that took place in a university setting. The main character, a 60-year-old mathematics docent, was in the process of teaching a class when he suddenly froze, made a strange facial expression, and began laughing. This behavior was unusual and lasted for 15 seconds. After the incident, the docent lost consciousness for 5-7 minutes, and there was blood in his mouth and on his ear. He was disoriented and did not understand much of what was happening around him.\n\nThe description of the incident suggests that the docent may have had a stroke or a seizure. A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, causing brain damage. A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including loss of consciousness.\n\nThe unusual laughter that the docent displayed before the incident could be a result of the stroke or a seizure. The sudden change in facial expression and behavior could be due to the altered state of consciousness caused by the stroke or seizure. The loss of consciousness and the blood in the mouth and ear are also consistent with the effects of a stroke or seizure.\n\nThe description of the incident is detailed and provides a clear account of the events that took place. The account is also consistent with the symptoms and effects of a stroke or seizure.\n\nIn conclusion, the description of the incident suggests that the docent may have had a stroke or a seizure. The unusual laughter, loss of consciousness, and blood in the mouth and ear are consistent with the effects of a stroke or seizure."

    "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines.

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",

I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder.

    "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3\u2019s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",

I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started. I\u2019m really just making a post to gather more insight and experiences from doctors and other people as well. If anyone has any insight as to what could be causing this, it would be much appreciated. This diagnosis has kinda knocked me on my ass, as I can\u2019t drive for 6 months after my last seizure. While I\u2019m glad my scans/tests were unremarkable, I wish I had gotten some sort of answer.",

    "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

    "question": "19F 167cm 59kg chinese in UK // \"passing out\" under certain conditions, suspected focal epilepsy?? duration: 3+ years?? (no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",

    "question": "Male 6months old no medical conditions, no medicine being taken. Approx 20lbs healthy baby boyMy son was sleeping and woke up screaming I went to soothe him and he couldn\u2019t be consoled for what seemed like forever. I tried waking him up from what seemed like a nightmare but he wouldn\u2019t wake finally he woke up and stopped screaming. He became unresponsive but with eyes open. He looked lethargic and wouldn\u2019t respond to stimulation. Then shook a little bit 3 times and went back to normal. Was this a seizure? Should I take him to the hospital or have his doctor look into it at his physical?Thank you for any responseUpdate: baby went to the doctor today they will be doing an EEG to be on the safe side.",

    "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

    "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",

    "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",

    "question": "36F 145 pounds 5'8 Started having issues with everything in my early to mid20s I'll list everything just in caseDIAGNOSED: Epilepsy - diagnosed in 2007 Narcolepsy with Cataplexy - diagnosed in 2009 Raynaud's with Erythermalagia - diagnosed 2016Other symptoms: Pins and needles in stomach, face, eyes, extremities, head -not all at once -this can occur at random times -sometimes while I work out, having sex (which can also cause my fingers or lips to stiffen and I have to wait for them to work itself out) sitting on the toilet, or laying down (which only happens to my stomach) Every blue moon, I'll have muscle spasms feeling like they are steming from my spine after I've laid down. It feels more neurological, if that makes sense.My body will feel like it's shaking on the inside, almost like it's vibrating. Usually when I'm tired.I have urge incontinence probably due to years of battling constipation. Must admit, I think it's getting better as it's not as frequently happening as it was.My left nostril will drip or run snot sometimes without me even realizing it (newer symptom) My primary doctor said it's probably just post nasal drip and prescribed me nasal spray twice a day. It does help dry it out but if I miss even one time, my husband will point out it running down.Recently switched neurologist and had a EEG done which I had an episode though it showed on the test and the nurse helped me through it, it registered as not a seizure or he said it didn't convince him that it was though the nurse clearly saw it.  At times when I'm feeling off I'm rushed with rapid heart beat, shakiness, and I can't read (everything looks to be in another language). At this point I feel confused, scared, angry, and rushed. Happens a lot when I have decisions to make. Restaurants, retail store, airport, etc.I get brain fog a lot but as long as I take my nuvigil I do a lot better.Here's why I'm posting... I can hear everything while having an episode, though sometimes when I repeat back what was happening while I have a seizure it's not all the way correct. I can't talk during it. My eyes roll back. The last one I shook some, which doesn't usually happens. I've had times where my hands cripple up (rarely). I usually feel a \"drooping\" or pulling in my bottom lip when things start and a complete lack of ability to use my muscles. They feel really heavy. I tend to stare right beforehand. The second to last episode I felt a pulling sensation, like someone was turning my head towards the left. When it ended, I head was facing left.My neurologist is putting me on Vimpat. I was taking Xyrem for ten years but last year I switched to ambien because my snoring got really bad.Current medication: Ambien 5mg Nuvigil 250mg I have an IUD I'll be starting Vimpat 100mgWasn't very active in my 20's Started working out in my 30's Past year in a half I have focused on strength training and cardio 5-6 times a week.",

    "question": "An MRI with Neuroquant showed these normative percentiles: Hippocampal Occupancy Score \u2013 32 Hippocampi \u2013 72 Superior Lateral Ventricles \u2013 94 Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74 The hippocampal volume seems normal but the hippocampal occupancy score is very low. What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward.

    "answer": "\nThe image is a text-based description of a person's health issues. The person is experiencing symptoms such as numbness in arms and legs, extreme fatigue, muscle spasms, and heat intolerance. They have been diagnosed with low testosterone and are being treated with testosterone replacement therapy. The person is also being referred to an endocrinologist and is currently undergoing a test replacement therapy.\n\nThe person's symptoms are consistent with those of rhabdomyolysis and extreme heat intolerance. Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in which muscle cells break down, releasing myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin is a protein that can cause kidney damage. Extreme heat intolerance is a condition in which a person feels cold in warm weather or has difficulty tolerating heat.\n\nThe person's symptoms could be related to a number of conditions, including rhabdomyolysis, extreme heat intolerance, and Lyme disease. Rhabdomyolysis is a possible cause of the person's symptoms, as it can cause muscle damage and release myoglobin into the bloodstream. Extreme heat intolerance could also be a contributing factor, as it can cause the person's body to overheat and lead to muscle damage. Lyme disease is a possible cause of the person's symptoms, as it can cause muscle and joint pain.\n\nThe person's symptoms could be managed with a combination of treatments, including medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. The person should also be monitored closely by their healthcare provider to ensure that their symptoms are not getting worse.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's symptoms could be related to rhabdomyolysis, extreme heat intolerance, or Lyme disease. They should consult with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment."

    "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",

    "question": "For a bit longer than a year, I've got random cramps in my sleep, I don't have any memories from that event afterwards and I also don't know what happens while it happens (seemingly like still being asleep). The only person that has observed the seizures/attacks is my girlfriend.Also I only get those cramps/seizures/attacks at night in my sleep and I know that I don't have photosensitive epilepsy.She furthermore described the attacks and mentioned that I seem to have trouble breathing and I seem to make weird noises.I was at a neurologist and he prescribed me Antelepsin at first and then Levetiracetam (up to now), which are both a medical substance that I have to take before going to bed. It does help, but it doesn't cure my state.I'm smoking tobacco on a daily basis, drink alcohol sometimes, smoking cannabis on weekends, and very rarely I take LSD in moderate dosages.As of yet I didn't get a real Diagnose, so I wanted to ask the reddit community, because why not giving it a shot right?I really hope someone can help me, mostly because I don't want to cause any more trouble and anxiety to my girlfriend.",

    "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",

    "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",

    "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",

    "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",

We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too?

    "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

    "question": "Female, 40, has a history of seizures but not since 2011, after surgery,  Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",

    "answer": "\nThe answer is: No, you cannot feel a seizure in your head."

    "question": "Hey all, I am a 30 yo white male. I am currently 270 pounds and 5'9. Active and fairly healthy. Meds: Keppra (1000mg x2 daily, Prozac 40mg 1x Daily, Clonazepam .5mg x2 daily, Meloxicam 15mg 1x daily, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin C Supplements) I had mono when i was 17 that developed into GBS. I had weakness, druken gate, and slurred speech and my main symptoms. Symptoms resolved in approx. 6 months and i was going back to normal. Shortly there after i started with seizures, one in November 2009, again in February 2010. I have been on Keppra since and been seizure free. I also have auto immune disease. One diagnosed, Hidradenitis Supperativa (doing well), and one undiagnosed. The undiagnosed one is more recently been bothering me.. i have Episcleritis and joint pain.. High ESR and CRP in the blood. I am worried about covid and want the vax but am afraid because i had a neurological reaction to the flu shot after my GBS. My Neurologist is insisting i get the vax and im talking to my Rheumi tomorrow. Is there anybody who can give me insight on what i should consider? Thank you!",

    "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

    "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nThe relationship between Chiari malformation and epilepsy is complex and not always straightforward. While the two conditions are often associated with each other, it is not always clear whether one condition causes the other. In your son's case, it is possible that the Chiari malformation is causing his epilepsy.\n\nChiari malformation is a condition in which the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination, is pushed down into the spinal cord. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, and difficulty walking. In some cases, it can also cause seizures.\n\nThe relationship between Chiari malformation and epilepsy is not always clear, but it is possible that the Chiari malformation is causing your son's epilepsy. The medication he is taking, Keppra, is often used to treat seizures caused by brain tumors or other conditions. It is possible that the medication is helping to control his seizures, but it is also possible that the Chiari malformation is causing his seizures.\n\nIt is important to note that the relationship between Chiari malformation and epilepsy is not always clear, and it is not always possible to determine whether one condition is causing the other. If your son's seizures continue to be a problem, it is important to talk to his doctor about other treatment options."

    "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",

    "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",

    "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam.

    "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours.

    "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",

    "question": "Hi. I just wanna have some guidance in advance if someone can help me :(This hadn't happened to me since March 2020. It happened again last week and sometimes I do feel a bit drowsy or weird but haven't had a full on focal seizure again.What I experienced was:Nausea I saw an aura, or like static? on my right eye that then turned into colors.   My limbs went cold I had a deja vu sensation, like I started to think things I hadn't thought of in two years? I don't know how to explain it I lost all peripheral vision on my right eye for a good while.Speaking was difficult Almost lost consciousness (in 2020 I did lose consciousness and moved my eyes from side to side very rapidly and my face went droopy last time). Back then I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything. Since it never happened again I didn't go see a neurologist but the other day it happened twice so I immediately booked an appointment.",

    "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",

    "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",

    "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

    "answer": "\nI\u2019m not sure if this is related to the CVST or if it\u2019s just stress. I\u2019m also not sure if the epilepsy is related to the CVST or if it\u2019s just stress."

    "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

    "question": "Does radiation necrosis heal? 31 female 155 lbs Diagnosed w/ Brain AVM & 2 aneurysms 2009. - 3 gamma knife treatments in 2019. edications: Topamax, Trileptal, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Clonidine, Vyvanse, Vitamin D, Folic Acid & had Kyleena IUD replaced February 16th. - important because vision symptoms started could be coincidence. Shortly after I had my new iud put in I started having issues with my left eye, vision became blurry\u201dish\u201d on and off. For the next 3 weeks I Had slow thought processing during the time & some confusion. - Hard time finding words. I also had some \u201cleft neglect\u201d symptoms but that\u2019s normal for me when I get migraines because my left side goes numb so I related all of this to stress & the migraines until I started having muscle twitching in my left hand & wrist. - I started to improve end of March but My vision is still off sometimes & I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be. I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me? No one has ever told me I had radiation necrosis. I guess I was always under the assumption my brain would heal itself after my radiation\u2026 but 4 years later it just seems to be getting worse. Does radiation necrosis heal/is it dangerous? Could this just be swelling? Did is progress fast from January 2022-April 2023? 4.. Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as a ischemic stroke? What is FLAIR hyperintensity? Those are just questions off the top of my head. I don\u2019t see a dr until June and google is not my friend.",

    "question": "Sex: M Age 48 Weight 235lbs Height: 6ft 2\" non smoker, non drinker epilepsy since birth, had his hemispheres separated about 15 years ago. Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",

    "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",

    "answer": "\nThe person is experiencing a combination of symptoms that could be related to a seizure or other neurological issues. They describe feeling lightheaded, dizzy, and experiencing a sudden gush or surge of chemicals in their brain. They also mention experiencing jerking and twitching in their body, which could be a sign of a seizure. Additionally, they mention having trouble sleeping and waking up with their body jerking, which could be a result of the seizures.\n\nTo diagnose and treat these symptoms, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional. They can perform a thorough evaluation, including a physical examination, medical history, and potentially imaging tests or blood tests to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. Based on the findings, the healthcare provider can recommend appropriate treatment options, such as medication, lifestyle changes, or further diagnostic tests.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's symptoms could be related to a seizure or other neurological issues. It is crucial to seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment."

    "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",

    "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",

    "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nNo, you should not be worried. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The stun gun is a non-lethal weapon that uses electricity to incapacitate an individual. It is not designed to cause harm or damage to the brain. Therefore, it is unlikely that the stun gun will cause any damage to your brain or bring back your epilepsy."

    "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........

    "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds. Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger.

    "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",

    "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",

    "question": "My current age is 31. Height: 5'7\" Weight: 140 lbs. I have been having convulsive seizures almost every month since I turned 26. These seizures almost exclusively occur within an hour of waking up. I walk around the house for up to half an hour, burning up. Could stress be a trigger for these episodes? I also have times where I get euphoric and nauseous, but they never last very long.Basically, what I want to know is, what is going on in my head. Is this temporal lobe epilepsy? Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",

However I started reading about it, there were some concerns reported last month that it may cause Neurological disorder and muscle paralysis.So as a someone who is treating from mild epilepsy (occurred to me only 4 times and usually my diagnosis are good) for about 6 years , should I be concerned about it ? also if I have the chance to take AstraZeneca should I do it ?Would appreciate your response because I can't reach to my Dr. at the moment",

    "question": "I\u2019m (19M) 6 foot 2, 74kg. I\u2019m on clobasam and tegratol for my epilepsy . Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don\u2019t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It\u2019s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit!

    "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",

    "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",

    "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",

    "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nThe answer is:\n\nPrimary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It means that the diagnosis is made after all other possible causes of the seizures have been ruled out. In this case, the doctor has ruled out any underlying medical condition that could be causing the seizures, such as a brain tumor or infection.\n\nThe abnormal EEG is likely due to the medication he is taking, Depakote. Depakote is a medication that is used to treat epilepsy. It can cause side effects, such as hair loss and liver toxicity. However, these side effects are rare and can be managed with the help of a doctor.\n\nThe doctor has decided to continue with the Depakote treatment for now. However, it is important to monitor the child's condition closely and to seek a second opinion if necessary. The child's growth and mental development should not be affected by the seizures, as long as they are properly treated.\n\nIn conclusion, the child's abnormal EEG is likely due to the medication he is taking, Depakote. It is important to monitor the child's condition closely and to seek a second opinion if necessary. The child's growth and mental development should not be affected by the seizures, as long as they are properly treated."

    "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nNo, this does not sound like a seizure. It is possible that you had a seizure, but it is more likely that you were experiencing a sleep paralysis episode. Sleep paralysis is a common experience that can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, sleep deprivation, and certain medications. It is not a cause for concern, and it is not a sign of epilepsy."

    "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",

    "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",

    "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "\nHi there! I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing seizures. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for your seizures. Here are some things you can do to help manage your seizures:\n\n1. Talk to your doctor: Schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your symptoms and get a proper diagnosis. They can order tests and imaging to determine if you have epilepsy.\n\n2. Follow your treatment plan: If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, your doctor will likely prescribe medication to help control your seizures. It's important to take your medication exactly as prescribed and to follow your doctor's instructions for managing your seizures.\n\n3. Educate yourself: It's important to educate yourself about epilepsy and your treatment plan. This can help you better understand your condition and how to manage it.\n\n4. Connect with others: Talking to others who have experienced seizures can be helpful. You can find support groups and online communities to connect with others who have had similar experiences.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

    "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",

    "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

    "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",

    "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",

    "answer": "\nThe EEG was recorded in a 12 channel system."

    "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

    "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",

    "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",

    "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m in a hurricane. And sometimes I feel like I can control the feeling. Like if I ask myself a yes or no question. Bunch of times.. when an answers right the hurricane feeling will get much heavier. I have no clue how to explain it but this morning I felt like there was a \u201cmagnet\u201d moving my had to my forehead. The thing is my hand couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t actually move Bc I was laying on it but it was like in my imagination. It feels like my brain is zipped up. I sometimes think I can hear it.

    "question": "24F In less than a month, 5\u20194\u201d, 114 lb, white. Marina, and occasional Tylenol. 9 months Postpartum, Arthritis, Depression, and Anxiety. No other drugs, or conditions. I\u2019ve been having seizure like things for about 4 months, the Dr\u2019s are confused by the full list of the symptoms, but believe they are seizures. It started with dizziness 6 months ago. So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG\u2019s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I\u2019m scared.. I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I\u2019m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn\u2019t have any \u201cepisodes\u201d yesterday, but couldn\u2019t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I\u2019m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr\u2019s that they might not be considering as an option.",

    "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",

    "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",

    "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",

    "question": " Female, 20, 5\"7\", 250lbs, CaucasianNo drug use, no current medication,For the past 6 years I've been having what I think is sleep paralysis fits, the symptoms are like this:I have a weird feeling before sleeping, I can't describe it but when i feel it i know i'm gonna fall into sleep paralysis. then I can't move anything, i'm aware of of my surroundings, scary ominous aura, and sometimes theres this loud ringing, like so loud I feel it in my head pulsing, then pain in my body like fingers being pushed in my sides, and even i sometimes feel my body...buzzing? or shaking fast i dont know if its happening IRL or just in my sleep, or a part of my brain feels like electricity, its usually painful, but there was one time it felt...kinda not bad...like a brain massage, then it went down my back. I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",

    "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",

    "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",

    "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",

    "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",

I Have since had an EEG that said i had no Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. I've not had these smells for a few weeks in the last 2 weeks i have started to notice eye floaters that follow where my eye goes only in sunlight. I have also noticed Bright flashing lights from the outter right corner of my eye. Some less worrying symptoms i have had. Sometimes 1 ear will get a high pitch noise that starts loud and fades out Muscle twitching hadaches sometimes. nothing severe Lightheadedness that may be related to anxiety/ or my low iron Sometimes cant think of the word i was thinking of or lose train of thought. Feel like im staring through what im looking at, kinda get daydreamy i guess? Also i do have a front tooth that is decaying / has a hole between the front and front right I have Severe anxiety and depression; and have been through a period of very high stress the last 3 months after breaking up with my long term partner.

    "question": "30 AFAB, 158cm/61kg, hispanic, Symptoms: lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods. flu-ish [see below] since a month ago.Diagnoses: Epilepsy, ADHD, Endometriosis, 5cm ovarian cyst, migrainesMedications: Lamotrigine 225mg, Ibuprofen for endometriosis pain, very occasional Concerta, haven't used it for a few months, melatonin over the summer (stopped it about two months ago)Others: Drink 1-2 drinks monthly, Slowly stopping smoking down from 6 to 1-2 per day and 1 light snus, last two days have started taking Vitamin D and I have been using a therapy lamp for 20 min every morning for the last two weeks. Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

I don\u2019t have a current issue but every time I\u2019ve had surgery I wake up completely full of beans, even when I\u2019ve just woken up in recovery. I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can\u2019t stop giggling. I don\u2019t feel sick at all and always want water and food immediately. Drs/nurses etc have commented it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even have surgery, but I\u2019ve never asked if there\u2019s a reason why. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I\u2019ve never been told I\u2019m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",

    "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",

    "question": "Gender: Female, Age: 9, Height: Idk tbh, Location: Head, How long ago: 1 week.So my co-workers daughter was just diagnosed with grey matter heterotopia. She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren\u2019t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",

It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",

    "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs.
