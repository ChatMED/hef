        "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned, especially given your recent seizure and ongoing symptoms.  While your neurologists have ruled out epilepsy based on extensive testing,  your persistent dizziness and disorientation after gaming warrants further investigation.  The fact that it's happening even with shorter screen time now suggests it's not solely eyestrain.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n* **Return to your neurologist:**  Your symptoms, even if not directly related to epilepsy, need to be addressed.  Explain the ongoing dizziness and disorientation specifically linked to gaming, even after short periods.  The fact that it started after your seizure and is persistent is significant.  They may want to consider other possibilities, such as:\n    * **Vestibular issues:** Problems with your inner ear responsible for balance could cause dizziness.  A referral to an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) doctor could help diagnose this.\n    * **Post-ictal symptoms:** Even if the initial seizure wasn't epileptic, there's a possibility that some lingering effects are contributing to your symptoms.  This needs careful discussion with your neurologist.\n    * **Medication side effects (beyond the initial seizure):**  While they attribute the seizure to medication, the current symptoms might be related to other aspects of your anxiety medication or its withdrawal.  Discuss this specifically with your neurologist, possibly considering a medication change or adjustment.\n    * **Anxiety and dissociation exacerbation:** The anxiety and dissociation you mention could significantly worsen your perception of dizziness and disorientation.  A therapist specializing in anxiety and dissociation could provide coping mechanisms and address the root causes.\n\n\n* **Detailed symptom tracking:**  Keep a detailed diary of your gaming sessions, noting:\n    * Length of gameplay\n    * Time of day\n    * Specific symptoms (type of dizziness, disorientation level, duration)\n    * Any other factors (stress level, sleep quality, food intake)\n    * Your anxiety/dissociation levels before, during, and after gaming.\n\n\n* **Consult an ophthalmologist:**  While eyestrain is a possibility, rule out other eye-related problems that could cause dizziness.\n\n\n* **Consider a different approach to gaming:**  Experiment with shorter gaming sessions, taking frequent breaks, ensuring proper lighting and posture.  If the symptoms are significantly linked to gaming, limiting your gameplay until you get a clearer diagnosis may be necessary.\n\n\n**It's crucial to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**  The information above is for informational purposes only and should not replace the advice of your healthcare providers.  Your persistent symptoms warrant further evaluation by your neurologist and potentially other specialists.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask detailed questions until you feel your concerns are fully addressed.\n"

        "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your description, it's impossible to definitively say whether you have epilepsy.  While you've experienced two episodes of loss of consciousness with associated symptoms (collapse, confusion, post-ictal state), the diagnostic criteria for epilepsy are more complex than just two events.  The fact that extensive neurological testing (EEG, MRI, CT scans) after the second event came back normal significantly weakens the case for epilepsy.\n\nHere's why your situation is complicated and requires further professional evaluation:\n\n* **Lack of Clear Seizure Characteristics:** Your episodes don't perfectly align with classic seizure descriptions.  While the second event involved a scream and collapse, it lacked the characteristic jerking movements or other motor manifestations often associated with seizures. The first event is even less clear.\n\n* **Negative Neurological Tests:**  The consistently normal results from your EEG, MRI, and CT scans are highly significant.  These tests are designed to detect abnormalities in brain structure and electrical activity that are often present in epilepsy.  Their negative results suggest no clear underlying neurological cause for your collapses.\n\n* **Possible Alternative Explanations:**  Several factors could explain your collapses, including:\n\n    * **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a common cause of fainting, triggered by various factors like dehydration, stress, sudden emotional upset, or even standing for long periods. Your first episode, occurring in cold water after a lack of sleep and alcohol consumption, fits this profile.\n    * **Sleep Deprivation and Alcohol/Substance Use:** Both lack of sleep and alcohol/cannabis use can significantly lower your seizure threshold even if you don't have epilepsy.  Your episodes occurred after periods of sleep deprivation and substance use.\n    * **Other Underlying Conditions:** Although your tests were negative, it's important to consider that rarer conditions might not be picked up by standard testing.\n\n* **Lamotrigine Prescription:** The prescription of Lamotrigine suggests the neurologist considered the possibility of epilepsy, but it's also used in other conditions.  The dosage is relatively low.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\nYou *absolutely* need to discuss your concerns with your neurologist.  The fact that you've had two episodes, even without clear seizure activity, warrants further investigation. They can:\n\n* Review your case history in detail.\n* Consider additional testing if needed (e.g., tilt-table test to assess for vasovagal syncope).\n* Adjust your Lamotrigine treatment if necessary.\n* Discuss potential alternative diagnoses.\n\n\nDo not self-diagnose or self-treat.  It's crucial to rely on a medical professional's expertise to determine the cause of your collapses and receive appropriate management.  Your experiences are concerning and require a thorough medical evaluation.\n"

        "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused and concerned.  The information you've read about epilepsy diagnosis needing two seizures is a simplification, and the reality is more nuanced. While two unprovoked seizures are often considered the diagnostic threshold, a single seizure *can* lead to an epilepsy diagnosis under certain circumstances.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why your husband's situation might lead to an epilepsy diagnosis despite having only one seizure:\n\n* **EEG findings:**  The EEG is not just looking for \"abnormal\" activity.  It's looking for specific patterns of electrical activity that are characteristic of epilepsy.  These patterns can include:\n    * **Epileptiform discharges:** These are distinct bursts of abnormal electrical activity that are highly suggestive of epilepsy.  They can take various forms (spikes, sharp waves, spike-and-wave complexes) and their location on the EEG can help pinpoint the area of the brain involved.\n    * **Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs):** These are abnormal discharges seen *between* seizures. Their presence significantly increases the likelihood of epilepsy, even if a person hasn't had more than one seizure.  Finding IEDs on an EEG is a strong indicator.\n    * **Patterns consistent with the type of seizure:** The EEG might show patterns associated with tonic-clonic seizures, further supporting the epilepsy diagnosis.\n\n* **The \"two-seizure rule\" is a guideline, not an absolute:** The two-seizure rule is a practical guideline based on statistics.  Most people who have one seizure will not have another.  However,  some individuals have a significantly higher risk of recurrence after a single seizure, and that risk is assessed based on several factors, including:\n    * **The type of seizure:** Tonic-clonic seizures have a higher risk of recurrence than some other seizure types.\n    * **EEG findings:** As mentioned above, IEDs drastically increase the chances of further seizures.\n    * **Neuroimaging (MRI):**  Structural abnormalities in the brain detected by MRI can indicate an underlying cause for seizures and increase the risk of recurrence.  This is why the MRI is important.\n    * **Other medical history:**  Certain conditions or injuries can increase seizure risk.\n\n* **Neurologist's judgment:**  Experienced neurologists consider all these factors when making a diagnosis.  Your husband's neurologist, having reviewed his EEG, likely saw evidence strongly suggestive of epilepsy, even with only one seizure.  The age factor you mentioned is relevant in terms of prognosis and likelihood of recurrence, but it doesn't negate the findings of an abnormal EEG showing epileptiform activity.\n\n**What questions to ask your neurologist:**\n\nYou have every right to ask clarifying questions.  Here are some suggestions:\n\n* \"Can you explain the specific findings on my husband's EEG that led you to diagnose epilepsy?  What type of epileptiform discharges were observed, and where in the brain were they located?\"\n* \"What is the risk of further seizures given the EEG findings and the type of seizure he experienced?  How does this risk compare to the general population with a single seizure?\"\n* \"What is the rationale for starting medication now, even with only one seizure?  What are the potential benefits and risks of the medication you're recommending?\"\n* \"What are the different types of epilepsy, and how does his diagnosis fit into those categories? What is the long term prognosis?\"\n* \"What is the likelihood that the diagnosis is a misdiagnosis? If the medication doesn't stop any future seizures, what is the next step?\"\n* \"When will the MRI results be available, and how will they affect the treatment plan?\"\n\nBy asking these specific questions, you'll gain a better understanding of the basis for the diagnosis and feel more confident in the treatment plan.  Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you remain uncertain.\n\n\nRemember, getting a diagnosis of epilepsy can be emotionally challenging.  It's crucial to be your husband's advocate and to actively participate in understanding his condition and treatment.\n"

        "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "There isn't a universal \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to whether someone with epilepsy can donate plasma.  The reason you were turned away likely stems from the plasma donation center's specific eligibility criteria, which often exceed minimum regulatory requirements for safety.  These criteria vary by center and are designed to protect both the donor and the recipients of the plasma.\n\nHere's why a plasma center might disqualify someone with epilepsy, even with well-controlled seizures:\n\n* **Seizure Control and Medication:** While your seizures are infrequent and you're on medication, the center may be concerned about the potential for a seizure during the donation process.  Even a controlled seizure could lead to injury or disruption of the procedure.  The fact that you're on lamotrigine is important, but the *frequency and severity* of your seizures (even in the past) are key factors considered.  Some centers have strict timeframes from a seizure before allowing donation (e.g., 6 months, 1 year seizure-free).  The medication itself might not be a disqualifier, but its effectiveness in preventing seizures is.\n\n* **Underlying Causes:**  Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with other underlying conditions that might affect plasma quality or safety. Although your epilepsy is well controlled, the center might require additional information or medical clearance to rule out any potential risks.\n\n* **Center-Specific Policies:** Plasma donation centers have their own internal guidelines that might be stricter than the minimum regulatory requirements.  These policies often prioritize safety and consistency.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Contact the Plasma Center Directly:**  The best approach is to contact the specific plasma donation center where you were turned away and ask for a detailed explanation of their rejection.  They should be able to provide you with their written eligibility criteria.\n\n2. **Consult Your Neurologist:** Discuss your desire to donate plasma with your neurologist. They can provide you with a medical assessment of your suitability and potentially provide documentation that supports your ability to safely donate.  A letter from your doctor stating your epilepsy is well-controlled might help convince the plasma center.\n\n3. **Explore Different Centers:**  Policies can vary between different plasma donation centers.  If one center rejects you, try another.  Be upfront about your epilepsy and be prepared to provide documentation.\n\n\nIn summary, while your epilepsy might not automatically disqualify you, the frequency of your seizures and the policies of the specific plasma donation center are the determining factors.  Open communication with both the center and your neurologist is crucial.\n"

        "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I\u2019ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I\u2019m seeing that I haven\u2019t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I\u2019m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I\u2019d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it\u2019s important to me to know when it\u2019s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated with constantly having to explain your past epilepsy. While you're right to be honest, the *relevance* of your past diagnosis depends heavily on the context.  It's not inherently irrelevant, but its significance diminishes greatly given your long seizure-free period following successful surgery.\n\nHere's a breakdown to help you decide when disclosure is necessary:\n\n**When it's VERY relevant:**\n\n* **Neurological Consultations:**  Any doctor specializing in the brain (neurologist, neurosurgeon) will *absolutely* need to know your history.  Even though you're seizure-free, your past surgery and potential residual effects could be important.  They may want to review your medical records to fully understand your brain's structure and function.\n* **Certain Medications:** Some medications can interact with the brain in ways that might trigger seizures in susceptible individuals, even if it's been years since their last episode.  Your doctor will need this information to assess potential risks.\n* **Head Injuries:**  If you experience a head injury, your history of epilepsy is crucial because it increases your risk of post-traumatic seizures.\n* **Surgery (outside the brain):** Some surgeries involve general anesthesia, which, while rare, can have a theoretical link to seizure induction in individuals with a history.  It may require extra precautions.\n* **Research Studies:** If you participate in a research study involving the brain or nervous system, they need complete medical history.\n\n**When it's likely relevant (but may require less detailed explanation):**\n\n* **Primary Care Physician:**  Your PCP should know your history, but a simple \"past history of epilepsy, successfully treated with surgery and seizure-free for many years\" may suffice.\n* **Gynecology/Obstetrics:**  Hormonal changes during pregnancy can sometimes influence seizure activity, so it might be relevant to discuss, though again, your long seizure-free history minimizes the concern.\n* **Dentistry:**  Mostly relevant if procedures involve sedation.\n\n**When it's likely *not* highly relevant (but still honest disclosure is best):**\n\n* **General medical checkups (non-neurology related):**  You can mention it briefly, but focus on the fact you've been seizure-free for many years and haven't had any issues.\n* **Most forms for insurance or employment:**  Unless the job directly involves neurological health or operating heavy machinery, it's unlikely to be a major factor.  However, always err on the side of full disclosure to avoid potential complications later.\n\n\n**Regarding your Driver's License:**  DMV regulations vary by location, but the initial suspension makes sense given your history.  The doctor's note confirming your long-term seizure freedom should permanently resolve this.\n\n**In summary:**  Always be honest.  However, the level of detail you provide should depend on the context.  A concise summary emphasizing your long-term seizure-free status after surgery is often sufficient unless dealing with a neurologist or similar specialists.  Consider keeping a brief, prepared statement to efficiently explain your situation.  If in doubt, err on the side of providing more information.\n"

        "question": "27 years old male Non smoker 73 kg 180 cm No other chronic illnessFor the past decade, I've been dealing with two distinct issues.- The first involves zigzag flashes across my field of vision, which are then followed by a mild headache lasting about an hour.- The second is an abrupt sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or dream recall that leaves me feeling anxious and uncertain about my own memories.Both of these \"auras\" typically last around 20 minutes. I haven't sought treatment yet since these episodes occur infrequently\u2014sometimes just once a year or once every few months.I'm unsure if what I'm experiencing is related to epilepsy or migraines?If anyone has had similar experiences, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible to diagnose your condition based solely on your description.  The zigzag flashes (scintillating scotoma) and headache strongly suggest migraine with aura. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dream recall, while less common with migraines, are also possible associated symptoms, and some people experience altered perception of time or reality as part of an aura.  However,  it could potentially be related to other conditions.\n\nThe infrequent nature of the episodes makes it harder to pinpoint a cause, but that doesn't diminish the importance of seeking professional medical attention.  While infrequent, these symptoms warrant a consultation with a neurologist.  \n\n**Here's why you should see a neurologist:**\n\n* **Differential Diagnosis:**  A neurologist can perform a neurological examination and possibly order tests (like an EEG or MRI) to rule out other conditions that could mimic these symptoms, such as:\n    * **Epilepsy:** While less likely given the description,  some types of epilepsy can present with auras that include visual disturbances and altered consciousness.\n    * **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or other neurological events:** Although less probable given the lack of other symptoms, ruling this out is crucial.\n    * **Other neurological conditions:** Less common possibilities exist that a neurologist can evaluate.\n\n* **Treatment and Prevention:**  Even if it's determined to be migraine, a neurologist can help develop a management plan, which might include preventive medication to reduce the frequency of episodes.\n\n* **Accurate Diagnosis:** Only a medical professional can provide a definitive diagnosis. Self-diagnosing can be dangerous and delay appropriate treatment.\n\n\n**In short:** While your description points towards migraine with aura,  it's crucial to consult a neurologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.  Don't wait until the episodes become more frequent or severe.  Schedule an appointment as soon as possible.\n"

There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019.

The fact that these behaviors have been present his whole life, coupled with the described facial expressions and body vibrations,  suggests a neurological condition that requires professional diagnosis.\n\nHere's why a medical evaluation is urgent:\n\n* **Unexplained neurological symptoms:**  The involuntary movements, facial expressions, and body vibrations could indicate a variety of neurological conditions, some of which require immediate treatment.  Delaying diagnosis could lead to complications or prevent timely intervention.\n\n* **Differentiation from seizures:** While you've used the term \"seizure-like,\" the description doesn't perfectly align with typical seizure characteristics.  A doctor can perform tests to determine if these are actually seizures (epileptic or non-epileptic), or if they represent another neurological issue, such as a tic disorder (like Tourette's Syndrome), a movement disorder (like myoclonus or dystonia), or something else entirely.\n\n* **Impact on daily life:** The frequency of these episodes significantly impacts his daily life, leading to social awkwardness and negative interactions.  Accurate diagnosis and potential treatment could dramatically improve his quality of life.\n\n\n**What to tell the doctor:**\n\nWhen you schedule the appointment, provide the doctor with a detailed description of both sets of behaviors, including:\n\n* **Frequency:** How often do each of these events occur?\n* **Duration:** How long do each of these events last?\n* **Triggers:** Are there any identifiable triggers for either behavior?

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The reason your seizures seem tied to tiredness isn't fully understood, but several factors related to sleep deprivation and fatigue could be contributing to the increased neuronal excitability that leads to seizures in your case:\n\n* **Neurotransmitter Imbalance:**  Sleep deprivation disrupts the delicate balance of neurotransmitters in your brain.  Neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow neurons to communicate.  An imbalance, especially involving excitatory neurotransmitters (like glutamate) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (like GABA), can make neurons more likely to fire uncontrollably, leading to a seizure.  When you're tired, this imbalance may be more pronounced than when you're alert and well-rested.\n\n* **Reduced Inhibitory Function:**  Insufficient sleep can weaken the function of inhibitory neurons, those that normally prevent excessive neuronal firing.  This reduced inhibition makes it easier for excitatory signals to overwhelm the system and trigger a seizure.\n\n* **Ion Channel Dysfunction:**  Sleep deprivation may affect the functioning of ion channels in neurons. These channels control the flow of ions (electrically charged particles) into and out of neurons, essential for generating electrical signals.  Dysfunction in these channels can make neurons hyperexcitable.\n\n* **Metabolic Changes:**  Sleep deprivation leads to metabolic changes in the brain.  These changes can affect the energy supply to neurons and their ability to function normally.  A lack of sufficient energy could destabilize neuronal activity and increase the risk of seizures.\n\n* **Stress and Cortisol:**  Fatigue often accompanies stress.  Stress hormones, like cortisol, can influence neuronal excitability and potentially lower the seizure threshold.  This effect is amplified when you're already sleep-deprived.\n\n* **Underlying Conditions:** It's crucial to remember that sleep-related seizures might indicate an underlying neurological condition that's exacerbated by fatigue.  This isn't to say that the fatigue *causes* the condition, but that it lowers the threshold for seizure activity.\n\n\n**It's absolutely vital to discuss this with your neurologist.** They can conduct further investigations, such as EEG (electroencephalogram) monitoring, to better understand the pattern of your seizures and identify any underlying conditions.  They can then recommend appropriate treatment strategies, possibly including medication to manage your seizures and improve your sleep hygiene.  Don't rely on online information for diagnosis or treatment; professional medical advice is essential.\n"

        "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out. I was also having some breakthrough seizures in my sleep.Current meds: escitalopram 15mg q24 (recent increase) lacosamide 200mg q12 gabapentin 400mg q8-12 buspirone 5mg q12 (new) tizanidine 2-4mg before bed celecoxib 100mg q12-24 Vyvanse 30mg as needed (which I did quit for a while to see if it was the culprit.

        "answer": "This is a serious situation requiring immediate and comprehensive attention.  Your experience following the procedure was traumatic and likely exacerbated your pre-existing conditions. The anesthesiologist's actions were negligent and potentially caused significant harm.  The lack of adequate follow-up care from your neurologist is also concerning.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key issues and potential next steps:\n\n**1. Medical Concerns:**\n\n* **The Propofol Incident:** This needs to be thoroughly investigated.  The fact that you experienced a cluster of seizures after being administered propofol, a medication you know causes you seizures, is a major red flag.  Your report against the anesthesiologist should be pursued vigorously.  Gather all your medical records related to this incident and the subsequent events.  Consider consulting a medical malpractice attorney.\n* **Sleep Disturbances (3-3:30 am awakening):** This is a very specific time, suggesting a potential underlying circadian rhythm disruption or other neurological issue.  Your neurologist needs to thoroughly investigate this, considering the possibility of post-traumatic epilepsy or other neurological complications related to the propofol-induced seizure cluster.  A sleep study may be necessary.\n* **Breakthrough Seizures:** This is a serious concern.  Your current medication regimen may not be adequately controlling your seizures.  Your neurologist needs to adjust your medication, potentially adding or changing anti-seizure medications, and possibly consider further neurological testing (EEG, MRI).\n* **Mental Health Deterioration:** The extreme anxiety, panic attacks, aggression, and mood swings are likely a direct consequence of the traumatic experience, exacerbated by your pre-existing conditions.  Your current mental health facility needs to develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing PTSD, anxiety, and depression. This could involve trauma-focused therapy (like EMDR or prolonged exposure therapy), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and potentially medication adjustments.\n\n**2. Immediate Actions:**\n\n* **Contact Your Neurologist Again:**  Demand a thorough review of your case, including the propofol incident and your current symptoms.  If they are still unresponsive, seek a second opinion from a different neurologist specializing in epilepsy and/or post-traumatic epilepsy.\n* **Follow Up on the Anesthesiologist Report:**  Actively pursue the outcome of your report.  If you haven't received a response, follow up with the relevant authorities.\n* **Mental Health Treatment:**  Work closely with your mental health facility to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses both your PTSD and your other mental health challenges.  Be open and honest about your symptoms and concerns.\n* **Sleep Study:**  Request a sleep study to investigate the cause of your specific sleep disturbances.\n* **Legal Counsel:** Consult with a medical malpractice attorney to discuss your options regarding the anesthesiologist's negligence.\n\n**3.  Long-Term Considerations:**\n\n* **Advocacy:**  Be your own advocate.  Keep detailed records of all appointments, medications, symptoms, and communications with healthcare providers.\n* **Support System:** Lean on your partner and other support systems for emotional support and practical assistance.\n* **Self-Care:** Prioritize self-care activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as mindfulness, meditation, gentle exercise, and spending time in nature.  Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can exacerbate anxiety and sleep disturbances.\n\n\nThis situation is complex and requires a multi-disciplinary approach.  Don't give up; persistent advocacy for yourself is crucial to getting the care you deserve and regaining your life. The possibility of inpatient hospitalization or IOP should be seriously considered if your condition doesn't improve with intensified outpatient care.  The sooner you get the proper medical and legal help, the better your chances for recovery.\n"

        "question": "I have 2 conditions(?) i want to mention, the second being (in my opinion) more severe than the first.the first is something ive noticed more recently. im not sure how long its been going on. i got an apple watch in december, which is the first heart rate tracking device ive owned. ive been using it to occasionally measure my heartrate, and ive noticed that my resting heart rate lies anywhere from 20-50 or 60 bpm lower than my standing heart rate. for a while, immediately upon standing i would become dizzy and my vision would fade a little, and i would see spots. this usually clears up after around 10 seconds 20 seconds at the most. ive seen a lot of resources about pots but i dont and have never fainted or started sweating due to standing the second is something i can give a lot more details on. ive been calling these \"blackouts\" but thats not medically accurate. it usually starts with me feeling unusually sick for a bit, then suddenly, the sickness symptoms will instantly disappear and my hearing will muffle greatly, and my ears will start ringing, but the ringing is also muffled. then, my field of vision will begin to tunnel, gradually getting smaller and smaller, until it becomes completely black, at which point i lose all recollection of what im doing, im basically acting without being conscious.these started when i was 8 and have happened every few years or so since, with them gradually getting worse and worse. the first time it happened, it was just slight lightheadedness and nausea, then muffled hearing and my vision partially tunneling, but not going all the way. this more recent time a little less than 2 years ago, however, i felt extremely nauseous, i felt extremely cold yet i was sweating profusely, i think i might have had a headache too i cant fully remember. i felt like i was gonna die before the \"blackout\" even started and the muffled hearing started. when i fully blacked out and lost consciousness (while still controlling my body, like a zombie in a sense), i have no idea how long i was out for, and i only was brought back to reality when i felt water hit my foot after i knocked over a pitcher.ive done a lot of research on this specifically and the closest thing ive found has been transient ischemic attacks. im not fully sure if this is a tia though, especially because i cant recall weakness in one side of my body at any time during one of these, but that might be because my memory during these events isnt really the best. additionally, my moms biological mom had several strokes before dying of another stroke, which could make me more predisposed to strokes, but again im not entirely sure. ive also gotten results for certain types of epilepsy, but i never looked too deep into them so that may not be validthe reason i bring these two afflictions up together is because maybe im missing something? maybe these are both signs of a rare illness or something? maybe theyre two different things that are co morbid? they may have nothing to do with each other at all though, i just want to include anything i can think of some other things i have are a heat sensitivity (not sure if this is the correct term, but basically i just get really really hot for no reason and cant cool off until i put cold water on my body), as well as sweating a lot, like ill be cold and still sweating. not sure if these have anything to do with the above but im adding it here just in case.if you have any questions feel free to ask, theres something i may have forgotten to add here. also im sorry about the length, i have a tendency to explain things with a lot more words than are needed",

        "answer": "You've described two concerning conditions, and it's wise to seek medical attention to get a proper diagnosis.  Your detailed descriptions are helpful.  Let's break them down:\n\n**Condition 1: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) possibility:**\n\nThe symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, and visual disturbances upon standing, resolving within seconds, strongly suggest a possible case of POTS.  The significant difference between your resting and standing heart rates further supports this.  While you haven't experienced fainting or excessive sweating (classic POTS symptoms), many people with POTS have a milder presentation.  The absence of these symptoms doesn't rule out POTS.\n\n**Condition 2: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or other neurological event possibility:**\n\nYour description of the \"blackouts\" is much more serious.  The sudden onset of nausea, muffled hearing, visual changes culminating in loss of consciousness, and the post-event amnesia are all highly concerning. While TIAs are a possibility, the lack of focal neurological deficits (like weakness on one side) makes it less likely, but certainly not impossible.  Other possibilities include:\n\n* **Syncope (fainting):** This could be the underlying cause of the \"blackouts,\" and it has several potential causes.\n* **Epilepsy:**  As you mentioned, some forms of epilepsy can present with similar symptoms, especially absence seizures or complex partial seizures.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  There are various rare neurological conditions that could cause these episodes.\n\n\n**Heat Sensitivity and Excessive Sweating:**\n\nThese symptoms are common with several conditions, including POTS, certain autonomic nervous system disorders, and even some endocrine issues.  They could be related to either of your primary concerns or entirely separate.\n\n\n**Important Next Steps:**\n\n1. **See a doctor immediately:**  Don't delay. Your description of the \"blackouts\" warrants urgent medical attention.  Your family history of strokes also adds to the urgency.\n2. **Comprehensive medical evaluation:**  This should include:\n    * **Detailed medical history:**  Including family history.\n    * **Physical examination:** To assess your neurological function, cardiovascular system, and overall health.\n    * **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** To check your heart rhythm.\n    * **Tilt-table test:** This is a key test for diagnosing POTS.\n    * **Neurological examination:**  To rule out neurological causes for the \"blackouts.\"\n    * **Blood tests:** To check for various underlying conditions.\n    * **Neuroimaging (MRI or CT scan):**  Possibly to rule out structural brain abnormalities.\n\n3. **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the frequency, duration, and specific symptoms of both the postural dizziness and the \"blackouts.\"  This information will be invaluable for your doctor.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that I cannot diagnose medical conditions. The information above is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  Seeking professional medical help is the only way to determine the cause of your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.  Your symptoms are potentially serious, so prompt medical evaluation is essential.\n"

        "question": "18M 72kg/160lbs 180cm healthy non-smoker and non-drinker. My blood pressure normally around 55/110 and my mother has epilepsy. I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your description, it's **highly unlikely** that what you experienced was an epileptic seizure.  Several factors point away from epilepsy:\n\n* **Low Blood Pressure:** Your blood pressure of 55/110 is significantly low.  This is a much more likely explanation for your fainting episode.  Fainting (syncope) often involves a temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain.  The hyperventilation likely contributed to this by causing a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in your blood, leading to vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). Standing up quickly after hyperventilation exacerbates this.\n\n* **Provoked Event:**  Your fainting was directly preceded by hyperventilation and standing up.  Epileptic seizures are usually unprovoked, although stress or sleep deprivation can be triggers.  The clear precipitating event in your case makes a seizure less probable.\n\n* **The Dream:** While some people report having brief dreams or sensations during seizures, the fact that you had a little dream suggests a more gradual loss of consciousness, consistent with syncope.  Seizures often involve a complete loss of awareness without any dream recall.\n\n* **Post-ictal Phase:**  The \"foggy\" feeling you describe is less consistent with a seizure's post-ictal phase (the period after a seizure where confusion and disorientation are common). Post-ictal phases are usually more pronounced and longer-lasting.  The fogginess is more aligned with the after-effects of fainting.\n\n* **Motor Activity:** While you did exhibit some motor activity (leg swinging and hand scraping), this can occur during syncope as well.  The short duration and unintentional nature of the scratching further support syncope.\n\n\n**However, it's crucial to consult a doctor.**  While this sounds like a vasovagal syncope event (fainting due to low blood pressure), your mother's epilepsy history warrants a medical evaluation.  A doctor can perform a thorough examination, review your medical history, and potentially order tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions.  They can also advise on how to prevent future episodes.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-diagnose.**  This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  See a doctor as soon as possible.  They can provide a proper diagnosis and create a plan to address the underlying cause of your fainting.\n"

        "question": "Female, 47, 65kg, 1.62cm, no other medicine or illness until thus far. No smoke, drinking, children or cases in the family.Up until I was 7 I took Gardenal. Then stopped - and my late granduncle was the top pediatric neurologist in the country - and did EEGs yearly until about 25.Had deja-vus up until college, never thought they could be considered related to epilepsy.When I was 45, epidemic, worst job in the world. Colleagues were in Rio, London, Lagos and Dubai. My sleep pattern went haywire, and I turned to Zolpidem to give me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Started at 5mg. As pressure grew, isolation, trouble in the job, slowly I grew the dosage. Had a burnout, left the job, and now I was taking 500mg to 600mg a day. Yes, 2 to 3 boxes. A day. I was floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid.Then I started having tonic-clonics. 8 in few months. I was deeply scared and built a team of therapist, psychologist and neurologist. Good news, nothing physical in the brain. Other good news is that I quit Zolpidem cold turkey, had withdrawal, suffered a lot... But quit.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This woman's case presents a complex picture likely involving several interacting factors contributing to her tonic-clonic seizures.  Let's break it down:\n\n* **Early Childhood History:**  The use of Gardenal (likely phenobarbital) until age 7, followed by yearly EEGs until age 25, suggests a possible underlying predisposition to seizures, although the reason for the initial Gardenal prescription isn't stated.  The EEGs being normal until now would indicate that this underlying condition, if present, may have been quiescent for a long time.\n\n* **Zolpidem Abuse:** This is the most significant factor.  The escalation of Zolpidem dosage to extremely high levels (500-600mg daily) is far beyond therapeutic doses and constitutes severe abuse.  Zolpidem withdrawal can itself trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.  The prolonged and high-dose use likely significantly altered her brain chemistry, potentially lowering the seizure threshold and causing the tonic-clonic seizures.\n\n* **Stress and Burnout:** The extreme stress from her job, isolation, and the difficult work environment acted as a potent trigger. Stress is a well-known seizure precipitant.\n\n* **Deja Vu:** The past history of deja vu, while not diagnostic of epilepsy, can be associated with temporal lobe dysfunction, which is sometimes involved in seizure generation.  It's worth noting that the relationship between past deja vu and current seizures is unclear, but it is a point to explore further.\n\n**In summary:** While the neurologist found no physical abnormalities in the brain, the severe Zolpidem abuse is the most likely primary cause of the tonic-clonic seizures.  The stress acted as a strong trigger, and a possible underlying predisposition (suggested by the early Gardenal use) may have also played a role.  The cessation of Zolpidem and the resolution of the overwhelming stress should significantly reduce the risk of further seizures.  However, ongoing monitoring and potential medication to prevent seizure recurrence are warranted.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n* **Withdrawal Management:** While she quit Zolpidem cold turkey, which is risky,  she should be under ongoing medical supervision for potential withdrawal effects.  There may have been some lingering withdrawal effects that contributed to seizures even after stopping.\n* **Underlying Epilepsy:** The possibility of an underlying seizure disorder independent of Zolpidem abuse should still be investigated even if her EEGs have been normal in the past.  Further neurological testing might be indicated,  potentially including more sophisticated EEG monitoring,  MRI scans focusing on specific areas of the brain, or other tests like a neuropsychological evaluation to fully assess potential cognitive consequences of both the Zolpidem abuse and the seizures.\n* **Long-term Management:**  Even if no further seizures occur, close monitoring is necessary.  A discussion with her neurologist about potential preventative medication, especially given her history, would be crucial.\n* **Therapy:** Continuing psychological therapy is vital to address the underlying stress and trauma contributing to the situation.  This will assist in preventing future stressful events that might trigger seizures.\n\nThis is not a diagnosis, but a summary analysis of the information provided.  A proper evaluation and treatment plan should be established by her medical team.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling exhausted, weak, and slow after a seizure, especially given the circumstances.  The fatigue is not necessarily unusual in the aftermath of a seizure, even a first-time one.  The physical exertion of a seizure, combined with the neurological effects, can leave you feeling drained for several days.  The fact that you were also under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin likely exacerbated this fatigue.\n\nHowever, the persistent and severe fatigue, coupled with your recent history of extreme nausea, warrants further investigation.  While the paramedics and your PCP's initial assessments were reassuring, your symptoms require more thorough evaluation.\n\nHere's why your concerns are valid:\n\n* **Post-ictal fatigue:**  The fatigue you're experiencing could be post-ictal fatigue, a common symptom after a seizure.  However, the duration and severity you're describing warrant close monitoring.\n* **Underlying condition:** The seizure, even if triggered by substances, could be a symptom of an underlying neurological condition that needs to be identified. While rare to have a first seizure in your 30s with no family history, it's not impossible.\n* **The nausea:** The severe nausea a month ago is a significant piece of the puzzle.  It could be unrelated, but it could also be a precursor to the seizure or a symptom of a larger issue.  It\u2019s essential that your doctors connect these symptoms.\n* **Substance use:** While substance use can trigger seizures in people without underlying conditions, it doesn't rule out the possibility of a pre-existing condition.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Follow up on the brain imaging:**  This is crucial to rule out any structural abnormalities in your brain.  Advocate for the imaging to be approved quickly.\n* **Contact your PCP immediately:**  Don't wait for the imaging results.  Describe the persistent and severe fatigue and your prior nausea episodes to your doctor.  They may want to order additional blood tests or conduct a more thorough neurological examination.  Even considering a referral to a neurologist would be prudent.\n* **Keep a detailed record:**  Note the timing and severity of your fatigue, any other symptoms you experience (headaches, dizziness, changes in vision, etc.), and any other relevant information.  This information will be valuable to your doctors.\n* **Avoid substance use:**  Until you have a clear diagnosis and understand the cause of your seizure, it's absolutely crucial to abstain from alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin.  These substances can significantly impact neurological function and potentially trigger more seizures.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  Your persistent symptoms require professional medical attention.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The neurologist's description of the EEG as \"essentially normal\" rather than simply \"normal\" suggests there were likely some minor findings on the EEG that weren't considered significant enough to definitively confirm epilepsy, but weren't entirely absent either.  These minor findings might include:\n\n* **Occasional, subtle abnormalities:**  The EEG might have shown very infrequent or brief periods of unusual brainwave activity that didn't meet the criteria for a clear epileptic seizure pattern.  These could be artifacts (noise from the recording process), or they might represent non-specific changes related to sleep, stress, or other factors unrelated to epilepsy.\n\n* **Non-specific slowing:**  The EEG might have shown slightly slower brainwave activity than expected for someone of her age, but again, not enough to be diagnostic of epilepsy.  This can be seen in various conditions, not just epilepsy.\n\n* **Borderline findings:**  Some EEG features might fall into a grey area, making definitive interpretation challenging.  The neurologist likely lacked sufficient confidence in classifying these findings as indicative of epilepsy.\n\n\nIn essence, \"essentially normal\" acts as a cautious qualifier.  While the EEG didn't show definitive evidence of epilepsy, it wasn't completely unremarkable either.  The neurologist is likely hedging their bets, acknowledging the clinical presentation (the witnessed episodes) while stating that the EEG doesn't provide conclusive confirmation.

        "answer": "You're right to seek clarification on the plasma donation restrictions for people with epilepsy.  The reason you can't donate plasma in the UK if you have epilepsy isn't solely about the risk of a seizure during the donation process, although that's certainly a contributing factor.  It's more complex and multifaceted.\n\nHere's a breakdown of likely reasons:\n\n* **Medication Interactions and Blood Safety:**  The medications you're taking, Keppra (levetiracetam) and Eslicarbazepine, are anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).  While generally safe,  there's a possibility of unforeseen interactions or effects on the plasma itself.  The donation process requires careful screening to ensure the safety of the recipient.  The presence of these medications at potentially varying concentrations in your plasma could introduce an unknown risk factor for the recipient.  Regulatory bodies prioritize recipient safety above all else.\n\n* **Seizure Risk During Donation:** As you mentioned, the risk of a seizure during the plasma donation procedure is real.  While relatively short, the procedure involves lying still for an extended period.  This could trigger a seizure, posing a significant safety risk to you.\n\n* **Unpredictability of Epilepsy:**  Epilepsy, even with medication, can be unpredictable.  The frequency and severity of seizures can vary, making it difficult for donation centers to reliably assess the risk for each individual.  They have to use standardized criteria to manage the risk to the donor and recipient.\n\n* **Underlying Conditions:**  Epilepsy itself might sometimes mask underlying health issues that could compromise the quality and safety of the plasma. This is a less direct but nonetheless important factor.\n\n**A doctor's note is unlikely to override these restrictions.**  The guidelines are set to protect both the donor and the recipient.  A doctor's note could confirm your health status, medication adherence, and seizure control, but it wouldn't eliminate the inherent complexities and risks mentioned above.  The regulations are based on population-level risk assessments and the inherent uncertainties associated with epilepsy.\n\n**Regarding micro-plastics:**  The link between plasma donation and reducing microplastics in your body is not currently supported by scientific evidence.  While some research is exploring microplastics' presence in the human body, there's no established method of removing them via plasma donation.  This is a separate issue from the eligibility criteria for plasma donation.\n\nIn summary, the restriction isn't about inconveniencing you; it's a safety precaution based on potential risks to both the recipient and yourself. While it's unfortunate that you can't donate plasma at this time, understanding the rationale behind the restrictions helps clarify the situation.  The focus of the UK blood and plasma services is on maintaining the highest safety standards.\n"

        "question": "My friend is 19 and pregnant. She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This situation is serious and requires urgent attention.  While I cannot provide medical advice, your friend's symptoms warrant immediate and thorough investigation by specialists. The fact that these episodes are occurring during pregnancy, coupled with her history of sepsis and low magnesium levels, makes the situation even more complex and potentially dangerous.  The fact the hospital couldn't pinpoint the cause is extremely concerning.\n\nHere's what you and your friend should do:\n\n* **Seek a second opinion immediately:**  Find a neurologist specializing in pregnancy complications and/or a perinatologist (a doctor specializing in high-risk pregnancies).  A larger hospital or medical center might have more specialized resources.  Explain everything you've described, including the previous sepsis and the description of the episodes, even if they weren't definitively diagnosed as seizures.\n\n* **Detailed medical history:** Ensure all medical professionals involved have a complete and accurate medical history.  This includes the sepsis episode, any medications she's taking (prescription and over-the-counter), her diet, and any other relevant information.  A detailed account of the episodes themselves, including how long they last, what triggers them (if any), and the precise symptoms afterward, is crucial.\n\n* **Comprehensive testing:**  Advocate for a comprehensive battery of tests, beyond just magnesium levels. This could include:\n\n    * **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To assess brainwave activity and detect any abnormalities.\n    * **MRI (magnetic resonance imaging):** To rule out any structural problems in the brain.\n    * **Blood tests:**  A wider panel of tests beyond magnesium levels should be conducted to look for infections, metabolic disorders, or other potential causes.\n    * **Lumbar puncture (spinal tap):** In some cases, this might be necessary to analyze cerebrospinal fluid and rule out infections or other neurological conditions.\n\n* **Pregnancy monitoring:** Because this is happening during pregnancy, close monitoring of both the mother and the fetus is vital.  The pregnancy itself needs to be carefully assessed for any complications.\n\n* **Support system:** Your friend needs a strong support system. Offer emotional support, help with practical tasks, and accompany her to appointments if possible.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Amnesia and confusion:**  These are significant symptoms and shouldn't be dismissed.\n* **Low oxygen saturation:** This is a serious finding and points towards a potential respiratory or circulatory issue.\n* **Sepsis history:** Sepsis can have long-term effects, and it's crucial that this history is thoroughly considered.\n\n**What NOT to do:**  Don't rely solely on the initial hospital assessment.  This sounds like a serious issue that requires more specialized investigation.  Delaying further evaluation could be dangerous for both the mother and the baby.\n\nUltimately, your friend needs expert medical care to determine the cause of these episodes and receive appropriate treatment.  Urge her to seek a second opinion and advocate for comprehensive testing.  Her safety and the health of her baby are paramount.\n"

        "question": "22F, 110 poundsCurrent Medications- Lamictal 200 mg in the AM & PM so 400mg total a day. Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",

        "answer": "It's great that you're proactively seeking information about your health.  However, I must emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge and discussion only, and should not be interpreted as a diagnosis or treatment plan.  **You must discuss your questions and concerns with your neurologist.**  They are the only ones who can properly interpret your medical history, imaging results, and provide accurate information about your condition.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n* **Could my lesion be shrinking?**  It's *possible* that the lesion appeared smaller on the more recent MRI.  However, there are several reasons why this might be observed, and it doesn't necessarily mean the lesion itself is physically shrinking.  The difference could be due to:\n\n    * **Imaging technique variations:** MRI scans can vary slightly depending on the machine, settings, and technician.  A seemingly smaller lesion might just reflect subtle differences in image acquisition.\n    * **Resolution:** Newer MRI machines often have better resolution, allowing for more precise visualization.  A previously identified area of concern might appear smaller or less defined with improved technology.\n    * **Resolution of inflammation or edema:**  Sometimes a lesion appears larger due to surrounding inflammation or swelling. If this inflammation resolves, the lesion might appear smaller on a subsequent scan.\n    * **Observer variability:** Different radiologists might interpret the scans slightly differently.\n\n* **Would my seizures stop if the lesion is shrinking?**  Even if the lesion is truly shrinking, there's no guarantee your seizures would stop completely. The relationship between brain lesions and seizures is complex.  The size of a lesion is not the only factor determining seizure frequency. Other factors influence seizure activity, including:\n\n    * **The location of the lesion:**  The exact location within the brain is crucial.  A small lesion in a sensitive area could still trigger seizures.\n    * **The underlying cause of the lesion:**  The original cause of the lesion (e.g., infection, injury, developmental anomaly) may influence seizure propensity.\n    * **Other brain activity:**  Seizures might not solely originate from the lesion itself. Other areas of the brain could be involved.\n\n**In summary:**  The changes you've observed on your MRIs need to be carefully evaluated by your neurologist. They can compare the images, review your medical history (including your history of dextromethorphan toxicity and seizures), and assess your current medication regimen to determine the best course of action.  They can explain the significance of any apparent changes in the lesion's size and discuss the likelihood of seizure cessation.  Don't hesitate to ask them about anything you don't understand \u2013 it's essential you are fully informed about your condition and treatment.\n"

This has been happening every other day in the last 2 weeks.I'm coughing up phelgmn and I've tried warm water to force the pill down as it is a enteric-coated pill, which reacts with water straight away. The longer the pill stays in my throat, it scrapes my throat and blood comes out with my spit. My throat is sore afterwards which takes two days to recover. I have to take my Epilepsy pills for life.I'm afraid to keep taking the 500ml tablets in the evening, as I keep having this reaction.Should I take 5 of the 200mg pills instead to make up the 1000mg required in the evening which are easier to swallow or do something else?I'm going to speak to my pharmacist and GP tomorrow morning as well about it.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds incredibly uncomfortable and concerning that you're experiencing this difficulty swallowing your Epilim 500mg tablets.  The bleeding and persistent throat irritation are particularly worrying.  While consulting your pharmacist and GP is absolutely the right next step, here are some things to consider in the meantime:\n\n**Do NOT unilaterally change your medication regimen.**  Switching from two 500mg tablets to five 200mg tablets *must* be discussed with your doctor or pharmacist.  Even though it's the same total dosage, there might be differences in how your body absorbs the medication, potentially affecting its effectiveness and leading to seizures or other complications.\n\n**Possible Reasons for the Difficulty:**\n\n* **Tablet Size and Shape:** The larger size of the 500mg tablet is likely the primary cause.  The enteric coating might also be contributing to a feeling of stickiness or difficulty passing.\n* **Dry Mouth/Dehydration:**  Insufficient saliva can make swallowing pills harder. Try drinking more water throughout the day, especially before taking your medication.  Consider sucking on a sugar-free lozenge or chewing sugar-free gum beforehand to stimulate saliva production.\n* **Underlying Throat Issues:** Your asthma and existing throat irritation could be exacerbating the problem.\n* **Medication Interactions:** While less likely, it's possible a slight interaction between your medications is making swallowing harder.  Your pharmacist and GP can assess this.\n\n**Temporary Strategies (Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist before trying):**\n\n* **Try a different liquid:** Instead of plain water, try swallowing the pills with a thicker liquid like applesauce or yogurt.  The added texture might help the pill go down more easily.  *But be aware that this can affect the absorption rate.*\n* **Change position:** Try sitting or standing upright, rather than lying down, when swallowing the pills.\n* **Smaller sips:** Instead of one large gulp of water, try taking several smaller sips.\n* **Break it up (If allowed):**  *Only if your doctor or pharmacist explicitly says it's safe* -- some enteric-coated tablets can be broken in half. This is generally discouraged with prolonged-release medications (such as some forms of Epilim), but is worth inquiring about.\n\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctor/Pharmacist:**\n\n* Describe the problem in detail, including the bleeding, throat soreness, and duration of the issue.\n* Explain you've tried warm water.\n* Mention your concern about continuing with the 500mg tablets.\n* Ask about the possibility of switching to five 200mg tablets or other alternative formulations (liquid, dispersible tablets, etc.).  There might be other brands of sodium valproate available that are easier to swallow.\n\nIt's crucial to address this problem promptly.  Don't hesitate to contact your doctor or pharmacist sooner than your scheduled appointment if your symptoms worsen or if you experience significant discomfort.  They can provide the safest and most effective solution for you.\n"

        "answer": "It sounds like you're going through a very difficult time, dealing with a complex array of symptoms and diagnoses.  It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and seeking answers.  The fact that you've had so many tests already and are still experiencing significant problems is concerning.\n\nLet's break down some potential connections between your symptoms and consider next steps:\n\n* **Vertigo, \"falling\" sensations, and micro-seizures:**  The connection between your vertigo, the feeling of \"falling,\" and the diagnosis of epilepsy (even without typical seizures) is significant.  These atypical symptoms are sometimes associated with epilepsy.  The MRI and MRA are excellent steps to further investigate potential neurological causes.  A normal MRI doesn't rule out everything, as some conditions might not show up on an MRI.\n\n* **Migraine lasting over a month:** This is concerning and is classified as a chronic migraine.  The prolonged duration warrants thorough investigation. The upcoming MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) will look at the blood vessels in your brain, which is important for ruling out certain vascular causes.\n\n* **Depersonalization:** The feelings of not feeling right or disconnected from yourself could be depersonalization, often associated with anxiety and sometimes triggered by neurological events or stress.  It's important to discuss this symptom with your doctor.\n\n* **Interaction of conditions:** It's crucial to understand that your BPD, anxiety, PCOS, and epilepsy can all interact and potentially exacerbate each other.  For example, anxiety can worsen migraine symptoms, and hormonal fluctuations from PCOS might influence both migraine frequency and epilepsy activity.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Be completely transparent with your doctors:**  Detail *all* your symptoms, including the duration, intensity, and any triggers you notice.  Mention the connection between different symptoms as you perceive them.  Bring a detailed timeline if possible.\n* **Advocate for yourself:** Don't hesitate to ask questions, request further investigations if you feel it's necessary, and seek second opinions if you're not satisfied with the answers you're receiving.\n* **Keep a detailed symptom diary:** This will help you track patterns and potential triggers for your migraines, vertigo, and other symptoms. Note the time of day, what you were doing, stress levels, food consumed, and any medications taken.\n* **Discuss medication management:** With so many medications, it's important to have an open discussion with your doctors about potential interactions, efficacy, and side effects.\n* **Consider a specialist:** You might benefit from seeing a neurologist specializing in headache disorders or a neuro-ophthalmologist, especially given the prolonged migraine and associated visual disturbances (if any).\n\n**It's vital to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**  The information above is for general knowledge and discussion purposes only.

However, the possibility of epilepsy returning after a period of remission, even a long one, does exist.  It's not guaranteed, but it's something to be aware of.\n\nSeveral factors can potentially trigger a recurrence of seizures after a period of remission:\n\n* **Underlying Cause:**  If the underlying cause of your epilepsy wasn't fully resolved (some causes are unknown), it could re-emerge.  This is less likely after a 7-year remission, but not impossible.\n\n* **Stress:** Significant emotional or physical stress (illness, injury, sleep deprivation, intense emotional events) can sometimes act as a trigger.\n\n* **Infection:** Infections, especially those affecting the brain (meningitis, encephalitis), can increase the risk of seizure activity.\n\n* **Head Injury:**  A head injury, even a mild one, could disrupt brain activity and trigger a seizure.\n\n* **Substance Use:** Alcohol, recreational drugs, and even some medications can lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk.\n\n* **Hormonal Changes:**  Hormonal fluctuations, particularly during puberty (which you're currently experiencing), can sometimes influence brain activity and potentially trigger seizures.\n\n* **Sleep Deprivation:** Lack of sleep is a well-known trigger for seizures in some individuals.\n\n* **Fever (in some cases):**  A very high fever (febrile seizures) can sometimes occur, especially in younger children, but this is less common in older teenagers.\n\n\n**It's crucial to emphasize that this is not a prediction.**  Many people with childhood-onset epilepsy remain seizure-free into adulthood after a period of medication.  Your long remission is a very positive sign.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Maintain regular contact with your neurologist or a specialist:**  Even without seizures, regular check-ups are advisable.  They can monitor your progress, discuss any concerns you have, and adjust your care plan if necessary.  This is especially important during periods of significant life change, such as puberty.\n* **Report any unusual symptoms:**  This includes changes in your sleep patterns, mood changes, unusual headaches, or any new neurological symptoms.\n* **Live a healthy lifestyle:**  Maintain a regular sleep schedule, manage stress effectively, eat a healthy diet, and avoid excessive alcohol and recreational drug use.\n\n\nThe information provided here is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",

The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional medical advice.  **Your niece needs to be seen by a neurologist.** The \"interesting\" comment from the urgent care doctor is insufficient given the concerning symptoms.\n\nThe description of your niece's episodes strongly suggests a need for further investigation by a specialist, especially given the recurrence. While the EEG was normal, this doesn't rule out all possibilities, as some conditions may not show up on an EEG.\n\nHere are some possibilities that a neurologist would investigate:\n\n* **Vasovagal syncope:** This is the most likely explanation based on the description.  It's a common cause of fainting, triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure.  Certain stimuli, like pain (e.g., brain freeze, a bump), emotional stress, or even the sight of blood, can trigger it.  The fact that it seems to happen while eating ice cream might be coincidental, although the cold could potentially contribute to vasovagal syncope in some individuals. The ice cream might not be the direct cause, but rather the association is a coincidence.\n\n* **Breath-holding spells:**  More common in younger children, these involve a temporary loss of consciousness often triggered by frustration or anger.  However, the convulsive movements described make this less likely, but still something to discuss with the neurologist.\n\n* **Other neurological causes:** While less likely given the normal EEG,  a neurologist would consider other possibilities, even rare ones, through further testing and a detailed neurological examination. This might involve more sophisticated EEG monitoring, MRI scans, or other tests.\n\n* **Cardiac causes:** Though less probable given the context, a neurologist might consider ruling out any underlying heart conditions, especially if there are any accompanying symptoms like palpitations or chest pain.\n\n**Regarding Ice Cream, Sugar, and Dairy:**\n\nThere's no direct established link between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and causing fainting or seizures in the way described.  While some individuals might have specific intolerances or sensitivities, this is usually manifested differently. The association with ice cream consumption might be entirely coincidental.  However, a sudden change in blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) *could* theoretically contribute to fainting in some people, but this would typically present with other symptoms.  Brain freeze is a potential trigger for vasovagal syncope due to the sudden cold stimulation.\n\n**What your sister should do:**\n\n* **Schedule an appointment with a neurologist:** This is absolutely crucial.  A neurologist specializes in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system and can conduct a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of your niece's episodes.\n* **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the time, circumstances, and symptoms of each episode.

The vagus nerve is involved in regulating heart rate and blood pressure.  Intragastric pressure changes from lifting weights, particularly pull-ups which put significant strain on the abdominal cavity, could potentially irritate or stimulate the vagus nerve near the hiatal hernia, leading to bradycardia (slow heart rate) or vasovagal syncope (fainting due to decreased blood flow to the brain). This is a reasonable theory and something a cardiologist specializing in syncope would consider.\n\n* **Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance:** Intense workouts, especially those involving pull-ups, can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances (sodium, potassium, magnesium).  These imbalances can disrupt heart rhythm and cause lightheadedness or fainting.  PPIs can also affect electrolyte absorption, though this is less commonly a significant factor in otherwise healthy individuals.\n\n* **Medication Interactions (unlikely but possible):**  While less likely, there's a theoretical possibility of an interaction between your PPIs and some other medication you might be taking (even over-the-counter ones).\n\n* **Underlying Cardiac Issue (ruled out, but not definitively):** Despite the extensive cardiac testing, a subtle or intermittent cardiac issue can sometimes be missed.  A tilt-table test might have offered further insight, but you mention extensive testing.\n\n* **Nutrient Deficiencies (potentially related to PPIs):**  Long-term PPI use *can* theoretically affect the absorption of certain nutrients, potentially impacting energy levels and contributing to lightheadedness.  However, this would likely manifest more generally than just after intense workouts.\n\n**Why Stopping Pull-Ups Helped:**\n\nThe fact that stopping pull-ups eliminated the episodes strongly suggests that the intense strain on your abdominal cavity and the resulting pressure changes were a key factor. This supports the vagal nerve stimulation hypothesis.  Reducing the amount of weight lifted further minimized the risk.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Consult a Cardiologist specializing in Syncope:**  Given the unresolved nature of your episodes, despite previous tests, a consultation with a cardiologist specializing in syncope is highly recommended.  They have expertise in investigating fainting and can perform specific tests to further evaluate your case.  This is more important than just a general cardiologist.\n\n2. **Discuss PPI Alternatives:** If possible, discuss with your gastroenterologist whether it's feasible to reduce your PPI dosage or explore alternative treatments for GERD.  This shouldn't be done independently, however.\n\n3. **Gradual Return to Exercise:** If you wish to resume pull-ups, consider doing so very gradually, under close medical supervision, perhaps with a cardiac rehabilitation specialist.  Start with modified pull-ups (assisted or fewer repetitions) and carefully monitor your response.\n\n4. **Hydration and Electrolyte Management:**  Ensure you are adequately hydrated and replenish electrolytes before, during, and after intense workouts.\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This information is for general knowledge and discussion only and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult with your physician or other qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n"

        "question": "I wanted to share my experience with you to maybe get some more information about my situation.For 10 years, I have been experiencing every couple of months sudden deja vu like feeling followed by dissociation. I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these episodes, especially since they've been happening for so long.  While anxiety can certainly contribute to feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dissociation,  the fact that they are seemingly unrelated to stress and occur regularly suggests it might be more complex than just anxiety.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu itself is a fairly common experience, and its causes aren't fully understood.  It can be triggered by various factors, including neurological activity, memory glitches, and even simple fatigue.  When combined with dissociation, however, it becomes more significant and warrants further investigation.\n\nDissociation, on the other hand, involves a disconnect from reality.  It can manifest in various ways, including feelings of detachment from your body, emotions, or surroundings. While anxiety can trigger dissociation, it's also a symptom of other conditions.\n\n**Possible explanations (beyond anxiety, though it could still play a role):**\n\n* **Temporal lobe epilepsy:**  While you don't describe seizures, some forms of epilepsy can present with subtle symptoms like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and brief periods of altered awareness without the classic convulsions.  This is a possibility that needs to be ruled out by a medical professional.\n* **Migraines:**  Some people experience auras before or during migraines, which can include visual disturbances, but also sensory distortions like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and altered perceptions.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  Rare neurological disorders can cause similar symptoms.\n* **PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder):**  While you haven't mentioned trauma, dissociation is a common symptom.  It's possible there's an unresolved traumatic experience contributing.\n* **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder:** This disorder is characterized by persistent or recurrent feelings of detachment from oneself (depersonalization) or one's surroundings (derealization).\n\n**What you should do:**\n\nIt's crucial to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.  They can:\n\n* **Conduct a thorough assessment:** This will involve discussing your symptoms, medical history, and any potential triggers.\n* **Rule out medical causes:**  They may order blood tests or neurological examinations to eliminate conditions like epilepsy or other neurological issues.\n* **Determine the appropriate treatment:** Depending on the underlying cause, treatment may involve medication (for anxiety, epilepsy, or migraines), therapy (for anxiety, PTSD, or depersonalization/derealization disorder), or a combination of both.\n\n\nDon't delay seeking professional help.  Understanding the cause of your symptoms is the first step towards effective management and improving your quality of life.  The fact that this has been happening for 10 years warrants a comprehensive evaluation.\n"

        "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a very concerning situation.  The simultaneous resolution of nausea and vomiting in three separate individuals (two humans and a cat) after moving strongly suggests a common environmental cause in the previous residence, not individual medical issues.  While psychosomatic illness is possible, the fact it affected the cat makes that less likely.\n\nHere are some possibilities to investigate:\n\n* **Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning:**  This is a serious possibility.  CO is odorless, colorless, and deadly.  Low-level chronic exposure can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.  The symptoms often mimic other illnesses, making diagnosis difficult.  The fact it affected all three of you simultaneously points strongly towards this.\n\n* **Mold:**  Extensive mold growth, particularly toxic mold species, can release mycotoxins into the air.  Inhalation of these toxins can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and headaches.\n\n* **Radon:** A radioactive gas that can seep into homes from the ground.  Long-term exposure can cause health problems.  While less likely to cause immediate nausea, it can contribute to other symptoms.\n\n* **Pests/Rodents:**  While less likely to directly cause vomiting, infestations can lead to secondary health issues through exposure to droppings, urine, or allergens, especially if there was significant infestation.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Carbon Monoxide Test:** This is the most crucial step. Purchase a CO detector and place it in your old residence if possible (or have the current owners do it).  If you can't access the old residence, consider a professional CO inspection.\n\n2. **Mold Inspection:**  A qualified mold inspector can assess the presence and extent of mold growth.\n\n3. **Radon Testing:**  A radon test kit is readily available.\n\n4. **Pest Control Inspection:** Check for signs of rodent or insect infestation.\n\n5. **Document Everything:** Keep records of your symptoms, the dates they started and ended, and any testing results.\n\nThe fact that the house is for sale means you have a responsibility to inform the current owners, the real estate agent, and potentially the tenants above you about your experiences. This information is crucial for the safety of future residents.  Failing to do so could leave you with legal liability.  The symptoms you and your husband experienced, along with those of your cat, warrant thorough investigation to determine the underlying cause and prevent others from suffering similar problems.\n"

        "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand your concern and anxiety about your symptoms.  It's important to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot diagnose medical conditions.  What you describe sounds concerning, and **it's crucial that you seek professional medical evaluation as soon as possible.**  Delaying this could potentially worsen your condition.\n\nWhile your hypothesis about serotonin syndrome and SSRI discontinuation syndrome is plausible, given your substance use and the timing of your symptoms,  it's impossible for me to say definitively what's causing them.  Myoclonus (the twitching) and brain zaps can have multiple causes, some benign, some requiring medical intervention.  The fact that it's worsened with caffeine and fatigue also points to something needing investigation.\n\n**Your concerns about epilepsy are valid, but not necessarily the most likely explanation based on your description.**  The absence of major convulsions, loss of consciousness, or other classic seizure symptoms makes a severe seizure less probable, but it cannot be ruled out.  Mild focal seizures are a possibility, but again, a doctor needs to evaluate this.\n\n**What you should do immediately:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with a doctor or go to urgent care.**  Don't wait for a distant appointment.  Explain your symptoms clearly and completely, including your substance use (honesty is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment).\n2. **Avoid caffeine and alcohol** until you see a doctor. These substances can exacerbate your symptoms.\n3. **Keep a detailed diary** of your symptoms: when they occur, their severity, any triggers you notice. This will be helpful for your doctor.\n\n**Why professional help is essential:**\n\n* **Accurate Diagnosis:** Only a doctor can perform the necessary examinations and tests (e.g., neurological exam, EEG) to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n* **Treatment:**  The treatment will depend on the diagnosis. If it is serotonin syndrome, the treatment will be different than if it's a neurological condition.  If it is SSRI withdrawal, medication management might be required.\n* **Peace of Mind:**  A proper diagnosis will alleviate your anxiety and provide a clear path to recovery.\n\n\nPlease don't self-diagnose or self-treat.  Your symptoms require professional medical attention.  Seeking help now is the best way to address this and prevent potential complications.\n"

        "question": "My little sister, age 12, was diagnosed with epilepsy for the last 1 year. She has been taking necessary medications for its cure and prevention. However, she has been ill for the last few days and we ran a few tests waiting to get reports tomorrow. It's 3am now and she has been acting and moving her body weirdly while sleeping for the last hour, we're suspecting she's having nocturnal epilepsy. Moreover, she has been telling us she feels tremor in her stomach for the past 3 days. It would be really nice if anyone could answer the following questions    What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?    What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable you're worried about your sister.  It's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge only and **you must follow the advice of your sister's doctor and neurologist.**  The unusual sleep movements and stomach tremors require immediate medical attention.  **Do not delay contacting her doctor or going to the emergency room.**\n\n**What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?**\n\nEpilepsy has many potential causes, and in many cases, the exact cause remains unknown (idiopathic epilepsy).  Possible causes include:\n\n* **Genetic factors:**  A family history of epilepsy increases the risk.\n* **Brain injury:**  Trauma to the head, stroke, or infection (meningitis, encephalitis).\n* **Developmental problems:**  Conditions present at birth or during development can sometimes lead to epilepsy.\n* **Brain tumors:**  Tumors can cause seizures.\n* **Infections:**  Certain infections can trigger epilepsy.\n* **Stroke:**  Disruption of blood flow to the brain.\n* **Metabolic disorders:**  Problems with how the body processes nutrients.\n* **Autoimmune diseases:**  Conditions where the body's immune system attacks itself.\n* **Drug or alcohol withdrawal:**  Stopping certain substances can trigger seizures.\n\n\n**What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or prevention?**\n\nThere's no guaranteed \"speedy cure\" for epilepsy, but effective management is possible.  This involves:\n\n* **Strictly following the doctor's prescribed medication regimen:**  Never change the dosage or stop the medication without consulting the doctor.\n* **Regular neurological check-ups:**  These are crucial for monitoring medication effectiveness and adjusting treatment as needed.\n* **Identifying and avoiding seizure triggers:**  These can vary from person to person and might include stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, illness, or specific foods.\n* **Keeping a seizure diary:**  This helps track seizure frequency, duration, and any potential triggers.\n* **Ensuring sufficient sleep:**  Sleep deprivation can worsen epilepsy.\n* **Healthy lifestyle:**  A balanced diet, regular exercise (with doctor's approval), and stress management techniques.\n\n\n**What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?**\n\n**Do not try to restrain her.**  Your priority is safety.\n\n* **Protect her from injury:**  Clear the area around her bed of anything she could hit her head on.  A soft mattress and padded side rails can help.\n* **Time the episode:** Note the start and end times.\n* **Observe carefully:** Try to note the type of movements, any changes in breathing or color, and if she seems to be in distress.\n* **Call emergency services (911 or your local equivalent) if:** The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, she's injured, she doesn't regain consciousness after the seizure, or she has trouble breathing.\n* **After the seizure:** Turn her onto her side to prevent choking.\n\n**What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?**\n\n* **Avoid activities with inherent risks:**  Swimming alone, climbing ladders, driving (until medically cleared), operating machinery.\n* **Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace:** This is extremely important, so emergency responders know about her condition.\n* **Inform school staff and close friends/family:** They should know how to react in case of a seizure.\n* **Create a safe home environment:** Remove tripping hazards, use non-slip mats in the bathroom, and consider padded flooring.\n\n\n**Again, the stomach tremors and unusual sleep movements warrant immediate medical attention.  Contact your doctor or go to the emergency room right away.**  They need to evaluate her condition and determine the cause of her symptoms.  Don't wait for test results tomorrow morning.\n"

        "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated and concerned about your left arm weakness when weightlifting.  While your neurologist attributed your weakness to the brain surgery, it's important to explore this further, especially given the specific nature of the weakness appearing only during strenuous activity.  Hemiparesis is a possibility, but other factors could also be at play.\n\n**Why Hemiparesis is a Reasonable Consideration:**\n\nHemiparesis, meaning weakness on one side of the body, is a known potential consequence of brain surgery, particularly surgery near motor areas.  The fact that your weakness is isolated to your left side (opposite the side of your brain surgery) makes this a plausible explanation. The surgery might have caused subtle damage to neural pathways controlling your left arm's strength, especially under stress.  Everyday tasks may not demand the same level of fine motor control and power as weightlifting, explaining why you don't notice it in daily life.\n\n**Why Other Factors Could Be Involved:**\n\n* **Neuroplasticity and Compensation:** Your brain is remarkably adaptable.  It's possible your brain has compensated for any subtle underlying weakness by recruiting other muscle groups for everyday activities.  Weightlifting, however, might push these compensatory mechanisms to their limits, revealing the underlying weakness.\n\n* **Muscle Imbalances:**  The unevenness of your arms and shoulders suggests a potential muscle imbalance. This imbalance, possibly pre-existing or developed post-surgery, could be exacerbated by weightlifting, leading to the weakness and trembling.\n\n* **Other Neurological Issues:** Although your neurologist ruled out scoliosis, other neurological conditions could contribute.  A detailed neurological exam might reveal subtle issues not readily apparent.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n1. **Seek a Second Opinion (Strongly Recommended):**  Consult a neurologist specializing in movement disorders or a physiatrist (physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist).  They can perform a more thorough neurological examination, possibly including electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies to assess the health of your nerves and muscles.\n\n2. **Physical Therapy:**  A physical therapist experienced in neurological rehabilitation can design a customized program to:\n    * **Strengthen your left arm:**  They'll focus on exercises tailored to your specific weakness, starting with very low weights or even bodyweight exercises and gradually increasing intensity.  They can identify compensatory movements and correct them.\n    * **Improve muscle balance:**  They can address any muscle imbalances between your left and right sides.\n    * **Improve motor control:**  Exercises focusing on coordination and fine motor control might also be beneficial.\n\n3. **Occupational Therapy:**  Occupational therapy might help adapt your weightlifting techniques to minimize strain on your left arm.\n\n4. **Keep a Detailed Log:** Document your symptoms, including when they occur, their severity, and any activities that seem to trigger them. This will be valuable information for your doctors.\n\n\n**Important Note:** Do not continue weightlifting exercises that cause significant pain or weakness. Pushing through the pain can lead to injury.  Focus on building strength slowly and consistently under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n"

        "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing a complex interplay of symptoms that require careful investigation.  The connection between your ovarian cysts, painful periods, epilepsy, and heart issues isn't immediately obvious, but there are potential links that warrant exploration by a specialized medical team.\n\n**The potential connections and why you need a multidisciplinary approach:**\n\n* **Hormonal Imbalance:** Your history of ruptured ovarian cysts, painful periods, and suspicion of PCOS or endometriosis strongly suggests a hormonal imbalance. This is crucial because hormonal fluctuations can significantly impact both epilepsy and heart rhythm.  Fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone are known to influence seizure threshold in some women with epilepsy, and they can also affect the heart's electrical activity.  The timing of your seizures relative to your menstrual cycle strongly suggests a hormonal influence.\n\n* **Epilepsy and Cardiac Issues:** The extremely high heart rate (275 bpm) during your grand mal seizure points to a potentially serious interaction between your epilepsy and your cardiovascular system. This is not uncommon; seizures can trigger abnormal heart rhythms. Your supraventricular tachycardia might be related to your seizures, but it could also be an independent issue. The ablation is a good step, but understanding the underlying cause is essential.\n\n* **Neuroendocrine Connections:** The brain and endocrine system are deeply interconnected.  Conditions affecting one often influence the other.  Disorders like PCOS and endometriosis can have subtle neurological effects.  Similarly, epilepsy can trigger hormonal responses. Your case suggests a significant neuroendocrine interaction warrants investigation.\n\n\n**Where to go from here:**\n\nYou absolutely need a team approach, including:\n\n1. **Neurologist specializing in epilepsy:**  They will continue to manage your seizures and investigate the expanding seizure foci (temporal and frontal lobes).  Discuss the correlation between your menstrual cycle and seizures extensively.\n\n2. **Cardiologist specializing in arrhythmias:** They will manage your SVT and interpret the Holter monitor results, ensuring the ablation is effective.  They need to understand the context of your seizures and the relationship between the arrhythmias and seizure activity.\n\n3. **Reproductive Endocrinologist (REI) or Gynecologist:** They will thoroughly investigate your reproductive history, potentially diagnosing PCOS or endometriosis, and managing your ovarian cysts and painful periods. They need to be aware of the potential hormonal influences on your epilepsy and heart condition.\n\n4. **Consider a consultation with a Neuroendocrinologist:** This specialist bridges neurology and endocrinology and may be particularly helpful in connecting the dots between your neurological, hormonal, and cardiac problems. They are less common but could provide invaluable insight into your complex case.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Detailed Medical History:** Provide each specialist with a complete history of *all* your medical problems, highlighting the temporal relationships between symptoms.  A timeline of seizures, heart flutters, and menstrual cycles will be incredibly valuable.\n\n* **Hormone Testing:**  Thorough hormone testing is needed to evaluate your hormonal profile and potentially identify underlying imbalances contributing to your various symptoms.\n\n* **Imaging:** Depending on the findings, further brain imaging (MRI) and possibly cardiac imaging (echocardiogram) might be necessary.\n\n* **Genetic Testing (Potential):** In some cases, genetic testing can reveal underlying predispositions to epilepsy or cardiac arrhythmias.  Discuss this possibility with your doctors.\n\n\nYou are not alone in this, and there are specialists who can help you. Your health journey requires patience, persistence, and a proactive approach to finding the right team to help manage your complex situation.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask questions until you feel heard and understood.\n"

        "question": "After standing from a prolonged period of sitting (especially when looking at a screen) I have 'episodes' which include spasms and staring. These occur multiple times a day, and I have had an ambulatory eeg. This has been happening for the last 4 years approximatelyThese came back to show that I don't have epilepsy, however my brain waves slow down and they suspect that I have mild cerebal hypoxia.My question is how bad is mild cerebal hypoxia because when severe, it can be very serious. Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about your symptoms and the diagnosis of mild cerebral hypoxia.  Let's break down your questions:\n\n**How bad is mild cerebral hypoxia?**\n\nMild cerebral hypoxia means your brain is receiving slightly less oxygen than it needs.  The severity depends on how mild it is and how long it lasts.  While severe hypoxia can lead to significant brain damage or even death, *mild* hypoxia is, by definition, less severe.  However, even mild, recurring episodes could have implications over time.  Think of it like a small scratch versus a deep wound \u2013 the small scratch might heal without issue, but repeated small scratches in the same spot could cause problems.\n\n**Does the frequency of your episodes flag a matter of concern?**\n\nThe frequency of your episodes (multiple times a day) is definitely a cause for concern, even if they're caused by mild hypoxia.  The fact that they're linked to prolonged sitting and screen time suggests a possible postural or circulatory component.  The spasms and staring are also significant symptoms that need investigation.  The fact that they've been happening for four years further underscores the need for thorough assessment.\n\n**Your situation and risk factors:**\n\nYour age (19), your type 1 diabetes, and the fact that you experience these episodes frequently all contribute to the importance of getting this properly investigated.  While your recent blood test was normal, it's important to remember that blood tests don't always reveal all the underlying issues, especially related to blood flow and oxygenation.\n\n**Possible Explanations (beyond mild cerebral hypoxia):**\n\nThe EEG ruling out epilepsy is good, but the symptoms don't perfectly fit a straightforward mild cerebral hypoxia picture.  Other possibilities, some of which could be related to or exacerbate the hypoxia, include:\n\n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** This condition involves a significant increase in heart rate and symptoms when standing up from a sitting or lying position.  The symptoms can overlap with what you're describing.\n* **Neurological issues:** While the EEG was negative for epilepsy, other neurological conditions could be contributing.  Further neurological evaluation might be necessary.\n* **Cardiovascular issues:**  Given your type 1 diabetes, even subtle cardiovascular issues could lead to reduced blood flow to the brain, especially when changing posture. This is why the cardiology appointment is crucial.\n* **Dehydration:** Even mild dehydration can impact blood volume and oxygen delivery to the brain.\n* **Underlying vascular issues:**  It's possible there's a subtle issue with blood vessels in your neck or brain that's only apparent during certain activities.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. **Prioritize the cardiology appointment:**  Even if it has a long waiting list, advocate for an earlier appointment if possible by explaining the frequency and concerning nature of your symptoms.\n2. **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the timing of each episode, the duration, your posture before it occurred, any associated symptoms (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea), and anything else relevant.  This information will be invaluable to your doctors.\n3. **Discuss your concerns with your primary care physician:**  They can help advocate for faster referrals and provide support in the meantime.\n4. **Consider a tilt-table test:** This test helps diagnose conditions like POTS.\n5. **Stay well hydrated:**  This is a simple step that might help manage symptoms, but it won't replace the need for a proper medical evaluation.\n\n**In summary:**  While mild cerebral hypoxia itself isn't necessarily a life-threatening condition, the frequency and nature of your symptoms require prompt and thorough investigation.  Don't delay seeking further medical attention.  Your detailed diary and proactive approach will help your doctors diagnose and manage the underlying cause.\n"

        "question": "Currently on no medications, BW is normal other than some minor indication of anemia and malnourishment (low folate, hemotacrit, hemoglobin, vitamin d, sodium) high albumin.Family history of a wide variety of mental health conditions as well as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycistic kidneys.Began approximately 4 years ago. Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs. Also have had gastrointestinal issues which i\u2019m not sure if they are relevant or not: nausea and stomach pain after eating anything. Have had some issues with UTI\u2019s. All doctors I have visited have told me there is nothing wrong and make me feel as if they just believe i\u2019m looking for free pills(or a hypochrondiac) but I am still having these issues so i\u2019m not sure where to go from here. pls help",

        "answer": "This is a concerning situation, and it's understandable that you're frustrated with the lack of diagnosis and the dismissal of your symptoms.  The fact that you've experienced severe headaches, tingling/numbness, weakness, motor ticks, fainting spells, convulsions, and memory problems warrants a more thorough investigation.  The doctors' responses are unacceptable, especially given the severity and persistence of your symptoms.\n\nHere's what I strongly recommend:\n\n**1. Seek a Second (and possibly Third) Opinion from Neurologists:**  Your existing neurologist's EEG was normal, but that doesn't rule out all neurological issues.  There are many conditions that might not show up on an EEG.  Find neurologists with expertise in epilepsy, movement disorders, and/or rare neurological conditions.  Emphasize the *cluster* of your symptoms, not just individual ones.  Clearly document the timeline of events and the frequency/severity of each symptom.\n\n**2. Comprehensive Neurological Workup:**  Insist on a more extensive evaluation, including:\n\n* **Detailed neurological exam:** This should go beyond a cursory check.\n* **MRI with contrast:**  While your previous MRI showed white matter changes (which are not uncommon and could be benign), a contrast MRI can highlight other potential issues.\n* **Further EEG testing:**  Consider a longer-term EEG (possibly ambulatory EEG which monitors brain activity over 24 hours or more) or video EEG (records brain activity while you are observed).\n* **Blood tests:** While some bloodwork has been done, more in-depth testing should be considered, especially focused on autoimmune diseases (which can manifest with neurological symptoms) and metabolic disorders.\n* **Lumbar puncture (spinal tap):** This could help rule out infections or inflammatory conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord.\n* **Genetic testing:** Given your family history of various conditions, genetic testing might be beneficial to look for predispositions to certain neurological or other medical issues.\n\n**3. Consider Other Specialists:**  Given the breadth of symptoms, consulting other specialists might be helpful:\n\n* **Gastroenterologist:** To address the persistent gastrointestinal problems.  These could be unrelated, but it's worth investigating.\n* **Endocrinologist:**  To evaluate the low vitamin D, sodium, and other nutritional deficiencies, which could be contributing factors or a symptom of a larger problem.\n* **Immunologist:**  To investigate the possibility of an autoimmune disorder.\n\n**4. Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Keep a meticulous diary tracking all symptoms, including:\n* Date, time, and duration of each event (headaches, tingling, weakness, convulsions, fainting spells, gastrointestinal issues)\n* Severity (scale of 1-10)\n* Triggering factors (if any, like flashing lights, stress, substances)\n* Medications (even over-the-counter) and supplements\n* Sleep patterns\n* Diet\n\n**5. Advocate for Yourself:**  You are your best advocate.  Be assertive but respectful with your doctors.  Bring your symptom diary to every appointment, and don't hesitate to seek second and third opinions if you're not satisfied with the care you are receiving.\n\n\n**Important Note:** The fact that convulsions occur more frequently with substance use doesn't necessarily mean they are solely caused by substance use. It could be that substances lower your seizure threshold, revealing an underlying condition.\n\nThis is a complex situation that requires a thorough and persistent approach.  Don't give up.  Finding the right doctor and the correct diagnosis is crucial for getting the treatment you need.\n"

I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated and seeking answers.  The fact that you experience these episodes with full awareness (you know they're coming and are conscious during them) makes epilepsy less likely, although it's not impossible. The previous negative EEG and MRI are helpful but don't rule out everything.\n\nGiven your symptoms \u2013 brief, unilateral (left-sided) weakness accompanied by facial distortion triggered by sudden movements or stress \u2013 several possibilities need to be considered, none of which can be diagnosed online.  You need to see a neurologist specializing in movement disorders.\n\nHere are some possibilities that a neurologist would investigate:\n\n* **Benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV):** Although the name suggests vertigo, some forms can present with brief weakness or dystonia (muscle spasms). While usually associated with dizziness, it's not out of the realm of possibility given the triggering factors.\n\n* **Functional neurological disorder (FND):** This is a condition where neurological symptoms are present but not attributable to a structural or neurological disease.  Stress and anxiety can be significant triggers. Your awareness of the episodes is common in FND.\n\n* **Focal dystonia:** This involves involuntary muscle contractions affecting specific body parts.  Your episodes could potentially represent a form of focal dystonia triggered by the sudden movements or stress.\n\n* **Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or other vascular issue:** Although less likely given the lack of persistent symptoms and negative imaging, a neurologist would want to rule out any brief episodes of reduced blood flow to the brain.  This would involve further investigations like a carotid ultrasound.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **See a neurologist specializing in movement disorders:**  This is crucial.  They have the expertise to differentiate between the possibilities and order appropriate investigations.  Emphasize the timing, triggers, and complete awareness you experience during the episodes.  Bring a detailed record of when the episodes occur and any factors that might be related (stress level, posture, movements, etc).\n\n2. **Request a video recording of an episode (if possible):**  A clear video can be incredibly helpful for the neurologist in assessing your symptoms.\n\n3. **Be prepared for further investigations:** These could include additional EEGs (perhaps with specific triggers simulated), blood tests, nerve conduction studies, or even further brain imaging (different types of MRI or other advanced imaging techniques) if the initial neurologist deems it necessary.\n\n4. **Consider a referral to a specialist in FND:** If other tests are negative, a neurologist may refer you to a specialist in Functional Neurological Disorders. They are particularly well-trained in diagnosing and managing these conditions.\n\nDon't lose hope.  A proper diagnosis is achievable, and once you have one, appropriate management and potentially even treatment options can be explored.  Getting to the right specialist is the most important step.\n"

        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for using any substance.  **You must consult with your doctor or a qualified neurologist before considering any substance use, especially given your history of chemotherapy-induced epilepsy.**\n\nYour situation requires careful medical oversight.  The interaction between chemotherapy-induced epilepsy, medications you might be on (anti-seizure drugs are common), and any other substance is extremely complex and potentially dangerous.  There is no safe \"variation\" of substance use that can be determined without a thorough professional evaluation.\n\nThe idea that microdosing might cause seizures while higher doses don't is counterintuitive and not supported by established scientific understanding of epilepsy or the pharmacology of any specific substance you might be considering.  Seizure thresholds are highly individual and depend on many factors, including underlying neurological conditions, medications, and the specific substance involved.  It's entirely possible that a low dose could trigger a seizure in someone who is vulnerable, while a higher dose might not \u2013 but this is not a predictable or safe pattern.\n\n**Regarding your question about specific epilepsy types and medications:** Even with precise knowledge of your epilepsy type and medication regimen, I cannot advise on substance use. The risks are simply too high.  Only a medical professional can assess your individual case, consider the potential interactions, and advise on whether any specific substance is safe for you, and at what dosage.  This assessment would involve a detailed medical history, neurological examination, and possibly further tests.\n\n**In summary:**  Do not attempt self-medication or rely on anecdotal evidence.  Your health and safety are paramount.  Schedule an appointment with your neurologist or oncologist to discuss your questions and concerns.

I really needed the offer and cannot afford losing it.I spoke to a counselor at my college and she thought, despite she doesn\u2019t think I have adhd, but considering I have epilepsy. Maybe I could seek advice from a doctor, but a specialist consultation can cost a lot\u2026",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling stressed and concerned about your symptoms and their impact on your academic performance, especially with a conditional university offer at stake.  Your concerns are valid, and seeking professional help is a wise step.\n\nWhile your counselor is correct that a specialist consultation can be expensive, it's important to weigh that cost against the potential benefits of improved focus, reduced stress, and a better chance of meeting your academic goals.  Here's a breakdown of how you can proceed:\n\n**1. Explore Lower-Cost Options:**\n\n* **Your primary care physician (PCP):** Start by talking to your PCP. They can perform a preliminary assessment, rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, and potentially refer you to a specialist or recommend less expensive options like therapy.  They might also be able to help you find resources for financial assistance with specialist visits.\n* **Your college's health services:**  Many colleges have counseling services and sometimes even psychiatrists or therapists on staff or available through partnerships.  These services might be included in your tuition or offered at a reduced rate. Explore what your college offers.\n* **Telehealth options:** Telehealth platforms can offer more affordable access to mental health professionals, including psychiatrists who could assess you for ADHD.\n* **Sliding scale therapists/psychiatrists:** Some mental health professionals offer services on a sliding scale based on income, making their services more accessible.  Look for these options in your area.\n\n\n**2.  Gathering Information for Your Doctor:**\n\nBefore speaking with your doctor or any mental health professional, gather as much information as possible about your symptoms.  This will help them make an accurate assessment. Consider keeping a journal to track:\n\n* **Specific examples of your attention difficulties:**  When do they occur?  What triggers them? What are the consequences?\n* **The impact on your daily life:** How do these difficulties affect your studies, relationships, and overall well-being?\n* **Family history of ADHD or other attention-related disorders:** This information can be helpful to your doctor.\n* **A timeline of your symptoms:** When did they begin? Have they changed over time?\n\n\n**3.  Important Considerations Regarding Lamotrigine:**\n\nIt's crucial to mention your lamotrigine use to any healthcare professional you consult. Some medications can impact focus and attention, and it's important to rule out any medication-related side effects.  They might consider whether adjustments to your lamotrigine dosage or a different medication might be helpful.  **Never adjust your medication dosage on your own.**\n\n\n**4.  Managing Stress and Procrastination:**\n\nWhile seeking professional help is vital, you can also implement some strategies to manage your stress and procrastination in the meantime:\n\n* **Time management techniques:**  Explore methods like the Pomodoro Technique, time blocking, or task prioritization to improve your focus and organization.\n* **Mindfulness and meditation:** These practices can help improve focus and reduce stress.  Many free apps and resources are available.\n* **Breaking down tasks:**  Large assignments can feel overwhelming. Break them into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* **Seeking academic support:** Your college likely has tutoring services or academic advising that can help you stay on track.\n\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out for help. Addressing these issues proactively will increase your chances of success in your studies and achieving your goals.  The sooner you start, the better equipped you'll be to manage your challenges and thrive.\n"

Currently taking : Lamictal 400mg Fluoxetine 10mg Omeprazole 40mg Gabapentin 300mg 3x day as needed Vitamin D DX : Bipolar type 2 Social phobia (not sure exactly how my psych phrased it) Anxiety Abdominal epilepsy Acid reflux Tobacco (on/off), marijuana use, almost never drink or use any other drugs. I will do my best to be brief. I have had serious mental health issues since I was a child. First suicide attempt was at 7. Institutionalized at 15 for suicidal ideation, and have had therapy since then. I restarted medications at 21. I have had a lot of bad experiences with medical professionals. Very abusive docs when institutionalized. My last doctor told me to treat my bipolar disorder with a multivitamin. The doctor before prescribed me an anti depressant, had a manic episode, then changed to lamictal 100mg. He also called me a drug seeker because I wanted muscle relaxers to treat a weird medical episode that was causing severe neck pain. This turned out to be abdominal epilepsy. I have used urgent cares on rare occasion to get antibiotics, etc. But I haven't had a pcp since I was 20. How can I find a PCP that is comfortable working with mental health patients? What do I need to have done to get on track? I am aware that I am extremely high risk for suicide, between bipolar, loss of a sibling to suicide, childhood sexual abuse. I feel it's more important than ever to get a grip on my physical health so I can have a long life with my wife and my parents, and live to take care of them in their golden years.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's commendable that you're prioritizing your health and seeking a better approach to healthcare after experiencing such negative past experiences.  Finding a good PCP who understands and supports your mental health needs is crucial. Here's a breakdown of how you can proceed:\n\n**1. Finding a PCP Comfortable with Mental Health:**\n\n* **Ask your therapist and psychiatrist for referrals:**  They're likely to know PCPs in your area who are experienced and empathetic towards patients with mental health conditions. This is your BEST starting point.  They can vouch for the doctor's approach.\n* **Search online directories:** Many websites allow you to filter doctors based on specialties and patient reviews.  Look for PCPs with experience in integrated care (treating physical and mental health together).  Websites like Zocdoc, Healthgrades, and Vitals often include patient reviews that might mention a doctor's approach to mental health.\n* **Check with your insurance provider:** Your insurance company's website or member services line can provide a list of PCPs in your network. You can then research those doctors individually.\n* **Specify your needs when contacting a doctor's office:** When calling to schedule an appointment or make an inquiry, explicitly mention your history of mental health conditions and your need for a PCP who is comfortable working with these conditions. This allows the office staff to pre-screen and potentially direct you to a more suitable physician.\n\n**2. Getting on Track:**\n\n* **Comprehensive Physical:** Your first appointment should be a thorough physical exam, including blood work (complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid function tests, etc.).  Your current medications could impact your blood work, so it's essential to get a baseline.  Discuss all your medications, including the Gabapentin (frequency of use is important here).\n* **Review of Medications:** Discuss your current medication regimen with your PCP and psychiatrist.  They should coordinate care to ensure your medications are safe and effective, and to monitor for potential interactions or side effects. The high dose of Gabapentin, especially for \"as needed\" use, needs to be carefully monitored.  Your Omeprazole dose is also on the high side and long-term use can have consequences.\n* **Addressing Substance Use:** Openly discuss your tobacco and marijuana use with your PCP.  They can help you develop a plan to reduce or quit, if desired, and assess how these substances interact with your medications.\n* **Dental and Vision Care:** Don't neglect these essential aspects of your overall health.\n* **Mental Health Support:** Continue your therapy and psychiatric medication management.  A strong therapeutic alliance is essential for your mental wellbeing.\n* **Safety Planning:**  Work with your therapist to create a detailed safety plan that outlines strategies for coping with suicidal thoughts and managing crises.  This is incredibly important given your history.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Be upfront and honest:**  Your honesty with your PCP about your past experiences, current medications, and substance use is crucial for building trust and receiving appropriate care. Don't be afraid to share your concerns about finding a good fit.\n* **Advocate for yourself:**  Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel uncomfortable or unheard by a medical professional.  Your health and well-being are paramount.\n* **Consider a collaborative care model:**  Some clinics offer collaborative care, which involves working with a team of mental health professionals and PCPs.  This integrated approach can be extremely beneficial for managing both your physical and mental health.\n\n\nYour proactive approach is admirable.  By taking these steps and being assertive in your healthcare, you're significantly increasing your chances of building a positive relationship with a supportive PCP and improving your overall health and well-being.  Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n"

        "answer": "It's impossible to definitively say what's causing your boyfriend's medication level drop without more information from his doctor.  However, several factors could contribute to unexpectedly low therapeutic drug levels despite increased medication dosages over three years.  This is a serious situation requiring careful medical investigation.\n\nHere are some possibilities that his doctor will likely be investigating:\n\n* **Medication Metabolism Changes:**  His body's ability to process (metabolize) lamotrigine and phenobarbital might have changed over time. This could be due to several factors including:\n    * **Age-related changes:**  Metabolic rate can naturally fluctuate with age.\n    * **Enzyme induction or inhibition:**  Certain substances can affect the enzymes that metabolize these drugs.  The marijuana use, although occasional, is a potential factor here as it can affect liver enzymes.  It\u2019s crucial his doctor knows the frequency and amount of marijuana use.\n    * **Underlying medical condition:**  An undiagnosed or developing medical condition could be altering his metabolism.  The high cholesterol and occasional high blood pressure could be contributing factors, or symptoms of another underlying issue.\n    * **Drug interactions:** While he's listed his known allergies and medications, there might be other interactions, even with over-the-counter medications or supplements.\n    * **Weight gain/loss:** Significant changes in body weight can impact drug absorption and metabolism.\n\n* **Medication Adherence:**  It's essential to determine if he's consistently taking his medication as prescribed.  Even minor inconsistencies can lead to lower blood levels over time.\n\n* **Absorption Issues:** Problems with how his body absorbs the medication from his gut could be contributing.  This is less likely given he's had a consistent increase in dosage, but possible.\n\n\n* **Medication Degradation:**  The medications themselves might be degrading before they are absorbed, perhaps due to improper storage or interactions with other substances (though this is less likely if they are properly stored).\n\n**The importance of further testing:** The additional blood tests are crucial. They might include tests to assess liver function (as the liver plays a key role in drug metabolism), kidney function (as they eliminate medications from the body), and possibly genetic testing to identify potential variations in genes related to drug metabolism.\n\n**What your boyfriend should do:**\n\n* **Follow up promptly** with his doctor to discuss the results of the additional blood tests and any recommended next steps.\n* **Be completely honest** with his doctor about his medication adherence, marijuana use, diet, and any other lifestyle factors or over-the-counter medications he's taking.\n* **Keep a detailed record** of his medication intake, any symptoms he experiences, and any changes in his health.\n\nThis situation warrants immediate medical attention.

These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",

        "answer": "It's great that you're seeing a doctor \u2013 that's the most important step.  Getting a professional diagnosis is crucial, and they can perform the necessary tests (EEG, possibly MRI) to determine what's going on.  \n\nBased on your description, it's understandable why you're researching Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE).  Many of your symptoms \u2013 the brief sensory hallucinations (tasting/smelling), sudden euphoria, dissociation episodes, and particularly the altered states of consciousness during sleep/napping \u2013 overlap with potential TLE symptoms.  The sleep paralysis-like episodes with the buzzing sensation and involuntary head movements are also concerning and could warrant investigation.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that **I am not a medical professional, and this is not a diagnosis.**  Many conditions can cause similar symptoms, and self-diagnosing can be misleading and anxiety-inducing.\n\nHere's why it's important to leave the diagnosis to your doctor:\n\n* **Differential Diagnosis:**  Your symptoms could be caused by other neurological conditions, sleep disorders (like narcolepsy or a sleep-related seizure disorder), or even psychological factors.  A doctor can rule these out.\n* **Comprehensive Evaluation:**  A doctor will perform a thorough examination and likely order tests to accurately assess your situation.  An EEG is particularly important for evaluating potential seizure activity.\n* **Treatment Plan:**  Only a doctor can provide a proper treatment plan based on a correct diagnosis.  This could involve medication, lifestyle adjustments, or other therapies.\n\nWhile you're waiting for your appointment, try to keep a detailed log of your symptoms:\n\n* **Date and time:** When each episode occurred.\n* **Duration:** How long each episode lasted (as best you can estimate).\n* **Specific symptoms:**  Detailed descriptions of what you experienced during each episode (e.g., type of smell/taste, nature of the euphoria, details of the dream-like states, etc.).\n* **Triggers (if any):**  Did anything seem to precede the episodes?  (Sleep deprivation is already noted, but are there others?)\n* **Context:**  Where were you? What were you doing?\n\n\nThis information will be invaluable for your doctor in making a diagnosis.  Don't hesitate to share your research on TLE with your doctor, but emphasize that you want a proper medical evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms.  It's commendable that you're proactive in seeking answers, but professional medical assessment is paramount.\n"

I am not sure what is causing it, but I am afraid to drive at night or in certain areas because of this issue.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned and afraid to drive after experiencing such a strong reaction to light reflections.  Your description suggests a possible sensitivity to glare or light-induced dizziness, but several factors could be at play, and it's crucial to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\n* **Photophobia:** This is an increased sensitivity to light.  While you mention it's worse with reflections, the underlying sensitivity could be contributing to your symptoms.  This can be a symptom of other conditions or a condition in itself.\n* **Migraine-related photophobia:**  Migraines can be preceded or accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light.  Even without classic migraine headaches, you might experience aura symptoms (visual disturbances) including sensitivity to light.\n* **Vestibular issues:** Your inner ear is responsible for balance.  While less likely from light alone, the intense visual stimulation from reflections could be triggering a vestibular response leading to dizziness and nausea.  This is especially true if the reflections are causing a sense of movement or disorientation.\n* **Visual processing issues:** A subtle issue with how your brain processes visual information might be exacerbated by the intense reflections, leading to the symptoms you're experiencing.\n* **Anxiety:** The fear of driving at night, knowing you might experience these symptoms, can create anxiety that worsens the physical symptoms. This is a vicious cycle.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. **See a doctor:** This is the most important step.  Describe your symptoms in detail to your primary care physician or an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). They can perform a thorough examination and potentially refer you to other specialists, like a neurologist if necessary.  Mention the specific circumstances (wet roads, tunnel lights) to help them understand the triggers.\n2. **Consider an eye exam:**  Make sure your vision is corrected properly.  Even a small refractive error (nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism) can worsen light sensitivity and glare.\n3. **Keep a diary:** Track when and where these episodes occur, what triggers them (specific light conditions), and the severity of your symptoms. This information will be invaluable for your doctor.\n4. **Drive safely:** Avoid driving in conditions that you know trigger your symptoms until you've consulted a doctor and determined the cause.  This is crucial for your safety and the safety of others.\n\n\nIt's important to note that I am an AI and cannot diagnose medical conditions.

        "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",

        "answer": "It sounds incredibly frustrating to live with epilepsy for so long without a clear diagnosis or significant improvement in your condition.  It's completely understandable that you feel this way, and it's commendable that you're proactively seeking more information and support.\n\nI am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  However, I can offer some suggestions that might be helpful in navigating your situation:\n\n**1. Seek a Second Opinion:**  Given your long history with your current neurologist and the lack of progress, seeking a second opinion from a different epilepsy specialist is strongly recommended.  A fresh perspective might uncover alternative diagnostic avenues or treatment options.  You can ask your GP for a referral to a different neurologist, or research epilepsy specialists in your area with expertise in treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\n**2. Explore Different Treatment Options:** Lamotrigine is a common anti-epileptic drug (AED), but it doesn't work for everyone.  There are many other AEDs available, and your new neurologist might consider trying a different medication, a combination of medications, or exploring other therapeutic options such as:\n\n* **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** This involves implanting a device that sends electrical signals to the vagus nerve, which can help reduce seizure frequency.\n* **Ketogenic Diet:** This high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet has been shown to be effective in some cases of epilepsy, particularly in children, but it can also be beneficial for adults.\n* **Surgery:** If your seizures originate from a specific area of your brain, surgical resection might be an option.  This would only be considered after thorough investigation and would depend on the location and extent of the seizure focus.\n\n**3. Comprehensive Epilepsy Evaluation:**  A new neurologist should conduct a thorough evaluation, including:\n\n* **Detailed seizure history:**  Keep a detailed seizure diary to document the time, duration, type of seizure, and any triggers.  This information is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.\n* **Neuroimaging (MRI, EEG):**  These tests can help identify any structural abnormalities or electrical activity in the brain that might be contributing to your seizures.\n* **Genetic testing:**  Genetic factors can play a role in epilepsy, and testing might help pinpoint the underlying cause in some cases.\n\n**4. Support Groups and Resources:**  Connecting with others living with epilepsy can provide emotional support and practical advice.  The Epilepsy Action charity in the UK offers resources, support groups, and information on living with epilepsy.  Their website is an excellent starting point.\n\n**5. Addressing the Impact on Your Life:**\n\n* **Driving:** The rules regarding driving with epilepsy vary depending on the type and frequency of your seizures and the medication you're taking. Your neurologist will be able to advise you on the legal requirements and when you might be able to reapply for a driving licence.\n* **Travel:**  Inform airlines and other travel providers about your condition before traveling. Carry your medication and medical documentation with you.\n* **Work:** Discuss your condition with your employer and explore reasonable adjustments that could make your workplace more supportive.  Your employer has a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  While alcohol can be enjoyable socially, it's important to discuss alcohol consumption with your neurologist. Alcohol can interact with AEDs and potentially trigger seizures.\n\nDon't lose hope.  Finding the right treatment plan can take time, but with persistence and the help of a knowledgeable medical team, you can significantly improve your quality of life.  Taking the initiative to seek a second opinion is a crucial step towards that goal.  Remember, you're not alone in this.\n"

        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're anxious after this experience.  What you describe is concerning, and it's good that you're seeking information.  While it *could* be related to several factors, it's impossible to diagnose what happened based solely on your description.  **You absolutely need to talk to your doctor or psychiatrist as soon as possible.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Low blood sugar:**  Not eating enough combined with weed use can definitely cause low blood sugar, which can lead to fainting or lightheadedness. This is a plausible explanation.\n\n* **Serotonin syndrome is a possibility, but unlikely with your low Prozac dose.**  The symptoms can include confusion, agitation, rapid heart rate, elevated blood pressure, muscle rigidity, and seizures.  However, serotonin syndrome is more common with higher doses of serotonergic medications or when combining several such medications. Your Prozac dose is low, and while you are also taking Lamictal, the risk of serotonin syndrome at these doses is considered relatively low.  The seizure-like event you describe isn't typical of a serotonin syndrome episode. However, it's still crucial to have this discussed with your doctor.\n\n* **Other causes:** There are many other potential reasons for what you experienced, some more serious than others. These could include a brief loss of consciousness from various factors, or a different kind of neurological event.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Contact your doctor or psychiatrist immediately.** Describe the event in detail, including the medication details, weed use, lack of food, and the dream-like experience.\n\n2. **Keep a detailed record of what you ate and drank, your medication schedule, and any other relevant information.** This will be helpful for your doctor.\n\n3. **Consider keeping a journal of your symptoms.**  This can help you and your doctor identify any patterns.\n\n4. **Avoid smoking weed until you've spoken with your doctor.** The combination of medication and lack of food may have exacerbated your reaction.\n\nIt's crucial to get a professional medical opinion to rule out any serious underlying conditions.  Don't delay contacting your doctor.  Your experience warrants a thorough evaluation.  While a simple fainting spell is a possibility, it's important to ensure that nothing more serious is occurring.\n"

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds incredibly frustrating and frightening to experience such unpredictable changes in your epilepsy management.  It's clear that communication and coordination of care have been significant issues in your case.  Let's break down why things might have gone downhill and what steps you can take:\n\n**Reasons for the Downward Trend:**\n\n* **Insufficient Dose of Lamotrigine:** The 25mg daily dose of Lamotrigine is incredibly low, especially given your history.  Lamotrigine takes time to build up to a therapeutic level, and such a low dose likely offered minimal seizure control. This is why the switch was so problematic.\n* **Abrupt Medication Cessation:** Stopping anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) abruptly, even after a period of seizure freedom, is risky.  Your body needs time to adjust.  While an EEG may be clear, that doesn't always guarantee seizure freedom once medication is stopped.\n* **Misunderstanding of Myoclonic Seizures:** The recurring theme of your myoclonic seizures being dismissed or misunderstood highlights a critical communication failure between you and your neurologists.  These are seizures, even if they are less dramatic than tonic-clonic seizures.  They are a significant indicator of ongoing epileptic activity.\n* **Poor Medication Switching Protocol:**  The lack of a clear plan for transitioning from Keppra to Lamotrigine created a dangerous gap in your medication coverage, leading to a seizure cluster.  Switching AEDs should always be gradual, with the old medication slowly tapered while the new one is titrated upwards.\n* **Sleep Deprivation as a Trigger:**  Your seizures are clearly linked to sleep deprivation.  Sleep disturbance is a known trigger for seizures in many people with epilepsy.  This needs to be addressed proactively, not just reactively.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1. **Find a New Neurologist:**  It's crucial to find a neurologist specializing in epilepsy who understands your specific situation, including the significance of your myoclonic seizures. They should have excellent communication skills and be proactive in managing your condition.  Consider seeking recommendations from other epilepsy patients or support groups.\n2. **Comprehensive Epilepsy Evaluation:**  Request a thorough evaluation, including a detailed seizure diary (tracking frequency, duration, triggers), EEG (to monitor brain activity), and potentially MRI (to rule out structural abnormalities).  Discuss the sleep deprivation trigger explicitly.\n3. **Adjusted Medication Regimen:**  Work with your new neurologist to develop a carefully planned medication regimen. This should ideally include a gradual adjustment of your AEDs, not abrupt changes.  The current 100mg Lamotrigine and 2g Keppra might be a starting point, but adjustments might be necessary.  Discuss the use of Clobazam and its potential long-term implications.  Be very clear about your experience with sleep deprivation and myoclonic seizures.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:**  Address your sleep issues aggressively.  Work with your neurologist and possibly a sleep specialist to establish good sleep hygiene.  This includes consistent sleep schedules, a relaxing bedtime routine, and potentially sleep studies to identify underlying sleep disorders.\n5. **Advocacy:**  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself.  Bring your detailed seizure diary to appointments, ask clarifying questions, and don't be afraid to express your concerns if you're not feeling understood or if your medication isn't working effectively.\n\nYour experience highlights the importance of finding a healthcare team who listens, understands, and actively participates in managing your epilepsy.  Don't give up; you deserve better care.  The situation is fixable, but requires proactive and informed management.\n"

        "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling shaken and have many questions after such a frightening experience. Let's address your concerns:\n\n**1. How common is this type of thing?**\n\nExperiencing a seizure without a known cause, like epilepsy, is less common than seizures associated with established neurological conditions.  However, it's not unheard of.  A single seizure can occur for various reasons, some temporary and some requiring further investigation.  Possible causes that your doctors will be considering include:\n\n* **Febrile seizures:** Although less likely at your age, a very high fever *can* trigger a seizure.\n* **Drug interactions or withdrawal:**  While you're lowering your Wellbutrin dosage, other medications or even supplements could be involved.  Mention *everything* you take to your doctor.\n* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Dehydration from being at the beach could, in theory, contribute, though your blood tests already looked normal.\n* **Sleep deprivation:** While you don't mention it, significant sleep deprivation can trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.\n* **Head trauma (even minor):**  Did you hit your head at all, even slightly, before the seizure? This is important to disclose.\n* **Infection:**  Though less likely given your negative test results so far, a rare infection could be a cause.\n* **Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE):**  Even with normal initial tests, this possibility remains.  Sometimes, the cause of epilepsy isn't immediately apparent. The MRI will be crucial here.\n* **Other underlying conditions:**  There are less common conditions that can cause seizures which need to be ruled out.\n\nThe fact that your initial tests were normal is reassuring, but it's crucial to complete the MRI and discuss this with your neurologist.  The MRI can reveal subtle brain abnormalities that might be missed by other tests.  They will be able to provide you with a more specific answer regarding the cause of your seizure once all the investigations are complete.\n\n**2. Should I wait a while before returning to hobbies?**\n\nAbsolutely, err on the side of caution.  Given that you had a tonic-clonic seizure, it's wise to postpone activities that could pose a risk if another seizure were to occur:\n\n* **Dancing:** The risk of falling and injury is significant.  Wait until you've had a thorough neurological assessment and your doctor gives you the all-clear.\n* **Sewing machine:**  The moving parts of the machine present a risk of injury if a seizure were to happen.  Again, wait for medical clearance.\n\nGenerally, it's recommended to avoid activities that could cause injury if you lose consciousness or have uncontrolled movements until your doctor determines the cause of the seizure and it is safe to resume your usual activities.\n\n**Important Next Steps:**\n\n* **Be completely honest with your neurologist:** Provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the seizure, your medical history, all medications and supplements, and any other relevant information.\n* **Follow up on all recommended tests and appointments:** The MRI is crucial.\n* **Discuss driving restrictions:** Your doctor will advise on when it's safe for you to drive again, likely after a period of seizure-free time.\n* **Consider a seizure diary:**  This can be helpful for your neurologist to track any patterns or triggers if future events occur.\n\n\nYour proactive approach to managing this situation is commendable. Remember to prioritize your health and safety, and keep open communication with your medical team.  A single seizure is not automatically indicative of epilepsy, but thorough investigation is essential to determine the underlying cause and ensure your well-being.\n"

My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had. I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.",

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're looking for answers after your epilepsy diagnosis.  Your initial understanding of epilepsy\u2014that it's either congenital or solely triggered by flashing lights\u2014is a common misconception.  The reality is far more nuanced.\n\nWhile some forms of epilepsy *are* caused by genetic factors present at birth, many cases, like yours, develop later in life due to various reasons, sometimes with no identifiable cause.  This is referred to as *cryptogenic* epilepsy.  The cause simply isn't known, even after extensive testing.  This doesn't mean there isn't a cause; it just means current medical science hasn't pinpointed it.  Possible underlying factors, although not definitively identified in your case, can include:\n\n* **Unknown genetic predisposition:**  While you weren't born with a diagnosed condition, you may carry a genetic susceptibility that only manifests later in life, perhaps triggered by an unknown environmental factor or a combination of factors.\n* **Prior undetected brain injury:**  A minor head injury, infection, or even a period of oxygen deprivation earlier in life, could have subtly damaged brain tissue, only manifesting years later as epilepsy.\n* **Developmental abnormalities:** Subtle structural differences in the brain that might not show up on routine imaging could be contributing factors.\n* **Autoimmune disorders:**  In some cases, the body's immune system might mistakenly attack brain cells, leading to seizures.\n\n**Flashing lights are a trigger for photosensitive epilepsy,** a specific type of epilepsy, but they are not the cause of epilepsy in general.  The fact that you haven't experienced issues with flashing lights suggests you don't have this type.\n\nThe fact that your seizures seem to come \"out of nowhere\" is common for cryptogenic epilepsy.  This makes management challenging, as there's no obvious trigger to avoid.  The focus then shifts to managing the condition through medication and lifestyle adjustments (getting enough sleep, managing stress, etc.).\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Continue working closely with your neurologist:**  They are your best resource for managing your epilepsy.  Discuss your concerns and ask specific questions about possible underlying causes and the latest research.  They may recommend further tests (like advanced brain imaging or genetic testing) depending on your medical history.\n* **Keep a detailed seizure diary:**  Record the time, date, circumstances surrounding your seizures (even if they seem to have no trigger), and any associated symptoms.  This information is crucial for your neurologist in evaluating your condition and adjusting your treatment.\n* **Don't hesitate to ask questions:**  It's perfectly normal to feel frustrated and uncertain about your diagnosis.  Don't be afraid to ask your neurologist or other healthcare professionals any questions you have, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nUnderstanding that your epilepsy is cryptogenic doesn't mean there's nothing to be done. Effective medication management is often successful in preventing further seizures.  Focus on your treatment plan, your open communication with your healthcare team, and building a support system to help you cope with this condition.\n"

Emphasize the severity and increasing frequency of your seizures and the ineffectiveness of your current medication.\n* **Consider a referral to an epilepsy center:** These centers have specialists and resources specifically designed for complex epilepsy cases.\n* **Document everything:** Keep a detailed record of all your appointments, conversations with doctors, and any changes in your condition. This documentation will be crucial if you need to pursue further action.\n* **Advocate for yourself:**  Politely but firmly advocate for your needs.  Bring a trusted friend or family member to appointments to help you articulate your concerns and remember details.\n* **Find a doctor who listens:** Don't give up searching for a doctor who takes your concerns seriously.  Your medical needs are valid.\n\nRegarding pharmaceutical company advertisements:  These ads are for general awareness and should not replace a doctor's assessment.  While they may suggest medication options, the decision to prescribe a particular medication rests solely with your doctor after careful consideration of your medical history and current condition.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-treat your seizures.**  Changing or stopping anti-epileptic medications on your own is incredibly dangerous and could lead to serious health consequences.\n\nYour safety and well-being are paramount.  Please seek immediate medical attention from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy.  Your life may depend on it.\n"

        "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a terrifying and incredibly stressful situation.  Your partner's sudden increase in seizures is a serious medical emergency, and his family's advice to not call an ambulance is deeply concerning and potentially dangerous.  His license is far less important than his life and health.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n**1. Prioritize his immediate safety and medical attention:**\n\n* **Call emergency services (911 or your local equivalent) immediately.**  Four grand mal seizures in one day is a critical event.  Do not delay.  Explain the situation clearly and truthfully to the dispatcher.  His family's concerns about his license are irrelevant compared to the potential for serious injury or death.\n* **Continue to monitor his breathing and position him on his side (recovery position) during seizures.** However, your priority now is calling for professional medical help.\n\n**2. Gather crucial information:**\n\n* **His medication:** What is the name of his anti-seizure medication, dosage, and when was his last dose?\n* **His medical history:**  Do you know the name of his neurologist or epileptologist?  Does he have any other medical conditions?\n* **Details about his seizures:**  Note the time of each seizure, its duration, and any noticeable triggers or symptoms beforehand.\n\n\n**3.  Prepare for the ambulance arrival:**\n\n* Have his medication information readily available.\n* If possible, find any recent medical records or contact information for his neurologist.\n\n\n**4.  Address the family's concerns (after ensuring his safety):**\n\n* Once the emergency is addressed, calmly but firmly explain that you acted out of concern for his well-being. The risk of losing his license pales in comparison to the potential life-threatening consequences of ignoring this medical emergency.\n* You are not responsible for his driving license; his health is the absolute priority.\n* You may need to consider explaining to the family the severity of the situation and the need for urgent medical intervention.\n\n**5.  Long-term considerations (after immediate crisis):**\n\n* **Advocate for your partner:**  Once he's stabilized, be his advocate.  Attend doctor's appointments with him, and make sure his medical team is aware of the recent spike in seizures and the family's hesitancy to seek immediate medical help.\n* **Consider your own well-being:**  Caring for someone with epilepsy can be extremely demanding, both emotionally and physically.  Seek support for yourself.  Talk to friends, family, or a therapist. You might consider support groups for caregivers of people with epilepsy.\n\n**Do not let his family's concerns override your partner's immediate medical needs.**  Four grand mal seizures in one day is a serious medical emergency that requires immediate professional attention. Your actions are showing that you care deeply about him and want him to get the best possible care.  Trust your instincts and call emergency services.\n"

        "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "No, anxiety and stress cannot directly *cause* epilepsy or seizures in someone who isn't already predisposed to them.  While anxiety and stress can *trigger* seizures in someone who already has epilepsy, they are not the underlying cause of the condition itself.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.  These seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  The causes of epilepsy are varied and complex, and often involve genetic factors, brain injuries, infections, or developmental abnormalities.  While stress and anxiety might make existing epilepsy worse, they don't create the underlying brain condition that leads to seizures in the first place.\n\nIf you are experiencing anxiety, stress, or seizures, it's crucial to see a doctor.  They can properly diagnose the issue and provide appropriate treatment.  A seizure should always be evaluated by a medical professional.\n"

        "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

        "answer": "This is a complex case requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Your daughter's extensive medical history and current symptoms warrant a thorough investigation.  The fact that her pain is worsening, coupled with the dizziness and falls, necessitates immediate medical attention.  While I cannot provide a diagnosis, I can offer potential areas of concern and suggest steps to take:\n\n**Potential Areas of Concern:**\n\n* **Intestinal Issues:** Despite negative celiac testing, the ongoing abdominal pain, worsened after eating, constipation despite multiple laxatives, and abnormally large colon raise concerns about potential underlying gastrointestinal problems.  This could include:\n    * **Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction (CIPO):** This condition mimics bowel obstruction but without a physical blockage.  Given her history of neurogenic bowel disorder, this is a strong possibility.\n    * **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):**  While less likely given negative inflammatory markers, it shouldn't be entirely ruled out, especially if other investigations are inconclusive.\n    * **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** Although less likely given the severity of the pain and the size of her colon.\n    * **Adhesions:** Scar tissue from previous surgeries or procedures could be causing pain and obstruction.\n* **Neurological Issues:** The dizziness, falls, and existing neurological conditions (epilepsy, neuropathy) require careful evaluation.  The pain could be related to nerve dysfunction or other neurological factors.\n    * **Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction:** Given her existing conditions, problems with the autonomic nervous system (which regulates things like heart rate and blood pressure) could be contributing to the dizziness and pain.\n* **Medication Side Effects:**  The numerous medications she's on could be interacting or causing side effects that contribute to her symptoms.\n* **Underlying Infection:** While unlikely given the absence of fever, an infection somewhere in the abdomen shouldn't be completely dismissed.\n\n**Urgent Steps to Take:**\n\n1. **Immediate Medical Attention:**  The dizziness and falls warrant an immediate visit to the emergency room or her physician.  This is not a condition to wait on.\n2. **Gastroenterology Referral:** A gastroenterologist is crucial to investigate the abdominal pain, bowel issues, and the abnormally large colon.  Further investigations might include:\n    * **Abdominal Ultrasound:** To visualize the organs and rule out structural abnormalities.\n    * **CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis:** A more detailed imaging test to detect potential obstructions or other abnormalities.\n    * **Colonoscopy:** To examine the colon directly and assess its condition.\n    * **Small Bowel Follow-Through:** To visualize the small intestine.\n    * **Further stool analysis:** To rule out infection or other abnormalities.\n3. **Neurology Referral:** The neurologist should review her neurological symptoms, especially the dizziness and falls, and consider further investigations such as:\n    * **EEG:** To assess brain activity.\n    * **Further neurological examination:** To investigate any new or worsening neurological signs.\n4. **Review of Medications:**  A thorough review of her medications is necessary to check for potential interactions or side effects that might be contributing to her symptoms.  A specialist in pediatric neurology and gastroenterology should ideally do this review.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Pain Management:**  Given the severity of her pain, it's crucial to work with her pain management specialist (if she has one) or her doctor to find an effective pain management plan.\n* **Nutritional Support:**  Her lack of appetite needs addressing.  A dietician might be helpful in developing a plan to ensure she's getting adequate nutrition.\n* **Mental Health Support:** The chronic pain, along with her existing anxiety and insomnia, likely impacts her mental health.  Continued support from a therapist or counselor should be considered.\n\nIt's crucial to be persistent in seeking answers for her pain. The combination of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms needs a comprehensive evaluation by specialists.  Don't hesitate to advocate for her and seek second opinions if necessary.  Her recent symptoms of dizziness and falls are particularly concerning and require immediate attention.\n"

Here's what I suggest:\n\n* **Find a neurologist specializing in epilepsy:**  This is crucial.  A general practitioner or even a neurologist without epilepsy expertise might not fully understand or be equipped to diagnose this type of complex presentation.  Search online for neurologists in your area specializing in epilepsy or temporal lobe epilepsy.  You can also ask your current doctor for a referral.\n\n* **Bring your logs:**  Your detailed records of the episodes, including timestamps, descriptions of symptoms, and any associated events, are invaluable.  They provide objective data for the neurologist to assess.\n\n* **Be persistent and assertive:** Don't give up if the first neurologist you see isn't helpful.  Explain your symptoms clearly and persistently, emphasizing the predictive nature of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the cyclical pattern.  If you feel unheard, seek a second opinion.\n\n* **Consider an EEG:**  An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain.  This is a common diagnostic tool for epilepsy and could help identify any abnormalities.  Your neurologist will likely recommend this.\n\n* **Mention your medical marijuana use:** Be open and honest with your neurologist about your medical marijuana use.  This information is relevant to your overall health and could potentially impact their diagnostic and treatment recommendations.\n\nIt's important to remember that I am not a medical professional, and this information is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation.

        "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

        "answer": "It sounds like you're going through a very difficult and confusing time.  The lack of a clear diagnosis, coupled with the severity and variety of your symptoms, is understandably frustrating.  The fact that different doctors have offered different diagnoses highlights the complexity of your situation and the need for thorough investigation.\n\nWhile I cannot provide a diagnosis (I am an AI and not a medical professional), I can offer some observations and suggestions based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Concerning Aspects and Potential Avenues for Investigation:**\n\n* **The Neurological Symptoms:** The episodes of uncontrollable movements, described as both chorea and focal aware seizures, are the most concerning. The differentiation between these is crucial.  Chorea is involuntary, jerky movements, often associated with neurological conditions like Huntington's disease or autoimmune disorders. Focal aware seizures involve altered awareness or consciousness focused on a specific part of the body or brain.  The fact that you are aware but your thought processes are impaired suggests a focal seizure might be more likely than a generalized seizure, although that's something only a neurologist can determine.  The possibility of tardive dyskinesia is less likely given your prior experience with it being different, but it's worth keeping in mind.  More sophisticated neurological tests might be needed, such as an MRI of the brain (to look for structural abnormalities), or potentially even a sleep study (to rule out certain sleep disorders mimicking seizures).\n\n* **The Autoimmune Suspicion:** The rheumatologist's suspicion of lupus is important. The joint pain, low-grade fevers, and mouth sores are all consistent with lupus, as is the worsening of symptoms around your period.  The ANA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 blood tests are key to diagnosing lupus, so it's crucial to get those results.  Other autoimmune conditions should also be considered if lupus is ruled out.\n\n* **The Fatigue:** The extreme fatigue warrants further investigation.  Narcolepsy should be considered again, especially with the sleep study recommendation.  While depression can cause fatigue, the level you describe suggests something more.  Conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) might be worth investigating, although those diagnoses are also challenging.\n\n* **The Hair Loss:** While often linked to stress and depression, significant hair loss could be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, including autoimmune disorders or nutritional deficiencies.\n\n* **The Edibles:**  The worsening of symptoms with edibles is important.  THC and HHC can exacerbate existing neurological conditions or trigger symptoms in susceptible individuals.  It's wise to discontinue them until a diagnosis is established.\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Complete the pending blood work (ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4, etc.)**  This is paramount to evaluating the autoimmune possibility.\n2. **Seek a neurologist's opinion.**  A detailed neurological examination, including a review of your symptoms and possibly additional tests (MRI, sleep study), is crucial to clarify the nature of the movement episodes.\n3. **Consider a second opinion from a rheumatologist.**  Another rheumatologist might offer a different perspective and further tests.\n4. **Keep a detailed symptom diary.** This will be invaluable for your doctors to track the progression of your symptoms and their correlation with other factors.  Include the timing, duration, and severity of your symptoms, along with any potential triggers.\n5. **Be your own advocate.** Don't hesitate to ask questions, request additional testing, and seek further opinions until you get a diagnosis and effective treatment.\n\n\nYour situation requires a multidisciplinary approach.  A team of neurologists, rheumatologists, and potentially other specialists may be necessary to fully understand and address your symptoms.  Do not give up until you have a clear diagnosis and a treatment plan.  Your perseverance in seeking answers is commendable.\n"

Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a complex and concerning situation requiring careful consideration.  Your presentation of epilepsy alongside severe osteoporosis at such a young age, with no obvious cause, is highly unusual and warrants further investigation.  The fact that the compression fractures occurred spontaneously during sleep further emphasizes the severity and unusual nature of your osteoporosis.\n\nHere are some thoughts and potential avenues for further exploration:\n\n* **Comprehensive Review of Existing Data:**  While you mention extensive testing, a fresh pair of eyes reviewing all your medical records, including imaging, lab results, and specialist reports, might reveal something overlooked.  A second opinion, ideally from a specialist in metabolic bone disease or a rheumatologist with expertise in rare bone disorders, is strongly recommended.\n\n* **Further Investigation into Epilepsy:** The epilepsy may be linked to your bone condition, although it's not immediately obvious how.  Certain rare seizure disorders can be associated with bone fragility, although this is uncommon.  A thorough neurological workup, potentially including genetic testing, might be valuable to explore any potential underlying neurological condition contributing to both epilepsy and osteoporosis.  Consider specialized epilepsy monitoring (e.g., video-EEG) to better characterize your seizure type.\n\n* **Deep Dive into Bone Health:**  The following areas warrant more in-depth investigation:\n\n    * **Genetic Testing:**  This is crucial.  Many genetic conditions can manifest as unexplained osteoporosis and epilepsy.  A broad panel focusing on bone metabolism and neurological disorders should be considered.\n    * **Inflammatory Markers:**  Even subtle inflammation can contribute to bone loss.  More sensitive inflammatory markers should be checked, possibly including specialized blood tests.\n    * **Nutritional Assessment:**  While you mention a healthy diet, a detailed nutritional assessment by a registered dietitian specializing in bone health can identify any subtle deficiencies.\n    * **Endocrine Workup (Revisited):**  While your endocrinologist may have performed standard tests, consider revisiting this with a focus on less common causes of osteoporosis, including rarer hormonal imbalances.  Testing for vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and other hormones related to bone metabolism should be comprehensive and repeated.\n    * **Bone Biopsy:**  This invasive procedure could provide microscopic analysis of your bone tissue to identify any abnormalities not detectable by other methods. It's not a first-line test, but it might be necessary if other investigations are inconclusive.\n    * **Medication Review:**  While Lexapro is not known to cause osteoporosis, a thorough review of all medications and supplements is essential.\n\n* **Consider Rare Disorders:** Some rare disorders can present with similar symptoms.  These are possibilities to discuss with your specialists:\n\n    * **Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI):** Although often diagnosed in childhood, milder forms can present later.\n    * **Fibrous Dysplasia:** This is a bone disease that can cause fragility fractures.\n    * **Rare Metabolic Bone Diseases:**  There are many, some extremely rare, that can present similarly.\n\n\n**In summary:** Your situation requires a multidisciplinary approach with a strong focus on identifying the underlying cause.  The lack of a clear diagnosis so far does not mean there is no explanation; rather, it emphasizes the need for more extensive and specialized investigation.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and to seek second opinions until you get the answers you need.  Your health and well-being demand a thorough and persistent approach to diagnosis.  This is not something to give up on easily.\n"

        "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your anxiety is completely understandable.  A first seizure in a teenager, especially with an unknown cause, is a serious event requiring prompt medical attention.  The uncertainty and the remoteness of your planned trip significantly increase the risk.\n\nFrom a purely medical perspective, **cancelling the trip is the safer option.**  Here's why:\n\n* **Unknown cause and potential for recurrence:** The cause of your son's seizures is unknown.  Tonic-clonic seizures can recur, and the risk is higher in the initial period after the first event.  A remote location significantly limits access to immediate medical care, which could be life-threatening if he experiences another seizure, especially a prolonged one or a series of seizures (status epilepticus).\n\n* **Emergency care limitations:**  A 30-minute drive to the nearest hospital is a considerable distance in a medical emergency.  Ambulance response times in rural areas can be unpredictable, and delays can have serious consequences during a seizure.\n\n* **Diagnosis and treatment:** Before embarking on a trip, especially a long one, your son needs a proper diagnosis and potentially medication to manage the seizures. This is crucial to mitigate the risk of future occurrences.  Beginning this process before the trip is essential.\n\n* **Potential for other health complications:** While your son is generally healthy, seizures can sometimes indicate underlying neurological issues that need immediate attention.  A remote location makes proper investigation and treatment challenging.\n\nWhile I understand the disappointment of cancelling a planned trip, the potential risks to your son's health and safety outweigh the inconvenience.

        "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable you're concerned about the persistent blood in your urine (hematuria). While 25 RBC/uL is a relatively low number and might be considered within the range of normal for some labs (the normal range varies slightly between labs), its persistence warrants investigation.  The fact that it's consistent over time without any clear symptoms makes it even more important to follow up with your doctor.\n\nSince you've ruled out a UTI (based on your statement of no infection signs),  the likely next steps your doctor would consider, given your situation, include:\n\n* **More detailed urine analysis:**  This might involve looking for specific types of blood cells (e.g., are they all red blood cells, or is there also white blood cell presence?), examining the urine sediment under a microscope for crystals (indicative of kidney stones) or other abnormalities, and potentially a culture (even though your initial tests showed no infection, a persistent issue might warrant this).\n\n* **Imaging studies:** This is probably the most important next step.  Your doctor will likely order an ultrasound of your kidneys and bladder to visualize them and rule out kidney stones, tumors, or structural abnormalities.  A CT scan might be considered depending on the ultrasound results.\n\n* **Further blood tests:**  A complete blood count (CBC) and possibly other blood tests could help assess your overall health and look for any underlying conditions contributing to the hematuria.\n\n* **Consider medication interactions:** While you weren't on Lithium at the time of the first test, it's worth mentioning to your doctor that you're now taking it, as some medications can affect the kidneys or cause blood in the urine as a side effect.  They'll want to factor this in.\n\n**Why it's important to pursue this:**  While it's true that some instances of microscopic hematuria (small amounts of blood) can be benign, it's crucial to rule out more serious causes.  Even without symptoms, persistent hematuria, regardless of amount, requires investigation to detect potential problems like:\n\n* **Kidney stones:** Even small stones can cause bleeding.\n* **Glomerulonephritis:**  Inflammation of the glomeruli (filtering units in the kidneys).\n* **Interstitial nephritis:** Inflammation of the kidney tissue.\n* **Kidney or bladder cancer:**  While less likely given your age and lack of other symptoms, it's still important to rule out.\n* **Other kidney diseases:**  Various conditions can affect kidney function and cause bleeding.\n\n**In the meantime:**  Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.  Avoid strenuous activity if you're experiencing any back pain.\n\n**Important Note:**  I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information above is for general knowledge and discussion purposes only.  You *must* follow up with your doctor as soon as possible for proper diagnosis and management.  The delay in your appointment is concerning \u2013 consider calling the office again to explain your concerns and see if they can expedite a follow-up or provide advice in the interim.\n"

        "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to say whether your experience was related to epilepsy.  The symptoms you describe \u2013 shaking, vomiting, dizziness, cold and numb sensations, and elevated heart rate and blood pressure \u2013 could be caused by many different things, and photosensitivity (sensitivity to bright, flashing lights) is associated with some forms of epilepsy but also with other conditions.  The fact that you were previously evaluated for epilepsy and found not to have it doesn't rule out the possibility of developing it later, but it does make it less likely.\n\nHowever, your symptoms sound concerning and warrant a medical evaluation.  The five-hour duration is also significant.  **You should see a doctor or go to an urgent care facility as soon as possible.**  They can perform a thorough examination, take your medical history into account (including your hormone issues and medication), and potentially order tests to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nSeveral conditions besides epilepsy can cause similar symptoms, including:\n\n* **Migraines:**  These can sometimes be triggered by bright lights and can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and even neurological symptoms.\n* **Vasovagal syncope:** This is a fainting spell triggered by various factors, sometimes including bright lights or stress.\n* **Panic attack:**  These can also present with similar symptoms, including rapid heart rate, dizziness, and nausea.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  Several other conditions can cause these symptoms.\n\n\nDon't rely on online information to diagnose yourself.  Seeking professional medical attention is crucial to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.  Mention the incident with the bright lights to your doctor, as this could be a relevant trigger.  The information you provide about your previous epilepsy testing and your current medications will also be helpful for your doctor.\n"

Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge and discussion purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.  **You must consult with your medical team immediately.** Your situation is serious and requires urgent attention from specialists.\n\nYour description points to a complex and concerning medical situation requiring expert neurological and neurosurgical evaluation.  Let's address your questions point by point:\n\n* **Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures?**  Uncontrolled epilepsy, especially with the severity and frequency you describe, *can* shorten lifespan, primarily due to the risk of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy).  The presence of a Chiari malformation and syrinx further complicates matters.  The extent to which your lifespan is affected is impossible to determine without a thorough assessment by your medical team.\n\n* **Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery?**  This is a question for your neurosurgeon.  The presence of a Chiari 1 malformation and syrinx *might* make you a candidate for surgery, but the decision depends on many factors, including the size and location of the syrinx, the severity of your symptoms (including the seizures), and the overall assessment of your neurological condition.  The surgery aims to alleviate pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord, but it doesn't directly treat epilepsy.\n\n* **Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy?**  Spinal decompression surgery for Chiari malformation is *not* a treatment for epilepsy.  While it might indirectly improve some neurological symptoms related to the Chiari, it's unlikely to directly control your seizures.  The epilepsy likely has a separate underlying cause.\n\n* **How much should I worry about SUDEP?**  Given your history of severe, frequent, and clustered tonic-clonic seizures, SUDEP is a significant concern.  You need to discuss this openly and honestly with your neurologist. They can assess your risk and discuss strategies to mitigate it.\n\n* **What do you do now?**\n\n    1. **Seek immediate medical attention:**  Contact your neurologist or go to the emergency room immediately.  Your recent aspiration event is a critical red flag.\n    2. **Comprehensive neurological evaluation:** You need a thorough workup to investigate the cause of your epilepsy.  This may involve advanced imaging (MRI, EEG), blood tests, and possibly genetic testing.\n    3. **Multidisciplinary team:**  Given the complexity of your case, you need a team of specialists, including a neurologist, neurosurgeon, and potentially a pulmonologist (due to the aspiration), and a psychiatrist for mental health support.\n    4. **Epilepsy treatment optimization:**  Your current medication regimen is clearly insufficient. Your neurologist needs to re-evaluate your treatment plan, possibly considering different medications, changes in dosage, or additional therapies.  Surgery for epilepsy might be considered as a last resort.\n    5. **Support system:**  Reach out to family, friends, or support groups for epilepsy.  Your situation is incredibly stressful, and having a support system is crucial.  A therapist or counselor can help you manage your anxiety and fear.\n\nYour situation is complex and serious.  Do not delay seeking immediate medical attention.  The information provided here is not a substitute for professional medical advice.  Your health and well-being are paramount.\n"

        "question": "i\u2019m currently living with my mom 60F who has had epilepsy for the past 30-ish years. i\u2019ve noticed her memory is declining, especially in the past year or so. it\u2019s not to the point where there could be any sort of formal diagnosis given but it\u2019s starting to concern me. i\u2019ve done some research into the correlation between epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s (or dementia in general) and from what i\u2019ve gathered the strongest correlation is between focal epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s due to the damage to the temporal lobe. my mom has tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) and i\u2019ve been trying to find information on how much her seizures affect the temporal lobe, but i can\u2019t find much and i think that\u2019s partially due to the lack of research. i don\u2019t know who to ask or talk to about this. i don\u2019t want to scare my mom but i\u2019ve scoured google trying to find more information but i can\u2019t seem to find anything. i just have so many questions\u2026is 60 too early to tell? once her memory starts to decline, how long does she have still being lucid? do grand mal seizures damage the temporal lobe in the same way focal seizures do? if that is what\u2019s happening, how do i make her feel loved and comfortable? examples of her memory issues: forgetting what she\u2019s talking about mid sentence (a lot). forgetting the names of people/places/things that she knows well. misplacing/forgetting objects fairly frequently, etc. i don\u2019t except anyone to know all the answers, but any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.EDIT: i understand with age there\u2019s usually going to be some forgetfulness, but this seems excessive to me. i\u2019m obviously not a professional, just a paranoid daughter, but my father is older and his memory is far better. also, more background: 60F, 5\u20192, 120lbs, past history of estrogen binding cancer (has had double mastectomy + hysterectomy); she fractured her neck following a seizure in 2017? i\u2019m not sure which vertebre, but she\u2019s made a full recovery. also she\u2019s had her left? hip replaced and currently suffers with nerve pain. on my maternal side, there\u2019s a lot of history of mental illness (including: BP-1 & 2, schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, major depression, BPD, ASPD, anxiety & panic disorders & some substance abuse - mostly heroin and meth) my mom is only formally diagnosed with clinical depression, and is on medication for both the epilepsy as well as depression. medications include lexapro & lamotrigine (she also briefly was using \"speed\" which she swears wasn\u2019t meth but there\u2019s a good chance it was)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're worried about your mom.  Seeing a loved one experience memory decline is distressing, especially when there's a pre-existing condition like epilepsy.  Let's address your concerns point by point:\n\n**1. Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe, and Memory:**\n\nYou're right, there's a stronger established link between *focal* epilepsy (seizures originating in a specific area of the brain) and cognitive decline, particularly when the temporal lobe is involved.  Temporal lobe epilepsy often leads to more localized memory problems.  Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, while they can cause widespread brain activity disruption, don't necessarily have the *same* pattern of damage as focal seizures.  The impact on the temporal lobe specifically is less consistently studied and less predictable with grand mal seizures.  However, *repeated* grand mal seizures over 30 years *could* contribute to cognitive decline through diffuse brain injury and reduced blood flow to various regions, including the temporal lobe.  This isn't a direct causal link like in focal epilepsy, but a possible contributing factor.\n\n**2. Is 60 Too Early?**\n\n60 is not too early for memory issues to arise. While Alzheimer's and other dementias are more common later in life, they can appear earlier.  Other conditions, such as vascular dementia (related to blood vessel problems in the brain), can also cause memory problems at relatively younger ages.  Your mother's history of a neck fracture following a seizure and a hip replacement (both potentially impacting blood flow to the brain) add to the complexities.  It's essential to rule out treatable causes before assuming the worst.\n\n**3. Timeframe After Memory Decline Begins:**\n\nThere's no single answer to how long someone remains lucid after memory decline starts.  The progression varies dramatically depending on the underlying cause.  Some conditions progress slowly, while others are more rapid.  Early intervention and management are crucial to slow progression whenever possible.\n\n**4.  Your Mom's Symptoms:**\n\nThe symptoms you describe (forgetting mid-sentence, names, objects, etc.) are concerning and warrant a medical evaluation.  They're not necessarily typical age-related forgetfulness.  The fact that your father's memory is significantly better at a similar age further highlights the need for assessment.\n\n**5. Who to Talk To:**\n\nYou need to schedule an appointment for your mother with her neurologist (the doctor who manages her epilepsy) *and* her primary care physician.  Explain your concerns in detail, including the family history of mental illness (this is important as some conditions can mimic or worsen dementia).  The doctors can conduct a thorough assessment, potentially including cognitive testing, blood work, and brain imaging (like an MRI) to rule out treatable causes of her memory problems.\n\n**6. Supporting Your Mom:**\n\nThe most important thing is to be patient, loving, and supportive.  If a cognitive decline diagnosis is made, focus on making her life as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. This might involve:\n\n* **Creating routines:** Consistency can help with memory difficulties.\n* **Memory aids:**  Use calendars, notes, reminders, etc.\n* **Safety precautions:**  Remove hazards, install safety devices.\n* **Emotional support:**  Be patient, understanding, and non-judgmental.\n* **Professional help:**  Consider home healthcare assistance if needed.\n\n\n**Important Note:** Don't rely on internet research for a diagnosis.  Only a medical professional can assess your mother's condition accurately.  Your concerns are valid, and seeking professional medical advice is the crucial next step.  It's better to get a thorough evaluation now and have peace of mind, regardless of the outcome.\n"

Sleep seizures during the depression but they are gone now.Thanks for any input.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The eye shaking (nystagmus) you experience upon waking after poor sleep could have several potential explanations, and it's difficult to say definitively without a neurological examination.  Your description suggests it's likely related to sleep deprivation and exhaustion, as you hypothesize.  The fact that it resolves quickly with movement supports this.  Muscle strain from trying to keep your eyes open when fatigued is a plausible cause.\n\nHowever, given your existing conditions \u2013 systemic sclerosis, epilepsy, migraines, and the inconclusive MS testing \u2013 it's crucial to discuss this symptom with your neurologist.  While likely benign, it's important to rule out any neurological complication related to your other conditions.  The \"mixed\" MS results warrant further investigation, and this new symptom could be a relevant piece of information in that context.  Nystagmus can be a symptom of MS, although it's not exclusive to the disease.\n\nHere's why it's important to seek medical attention:\n\n* **Differential Diagnosis:**  Your existing conditions make it challenging to differentiate between symptoms stemming from one condition versus another.  A thorough neurological evaluation can help clarify the cause.\n* **MS Progression:**  If you have MS, even subtle changes in neurological function could indicate disease progression, necessitating adjustment to treatment.\n* **Medication Side Effects:** While less likely, some medications can contribute to eye movement disorders.  Your neurologist can assess potential interactions or side effects.\n* **Sleep Disorders:** The severity of your sleep disturbances could indicate an underlying sleep disorder beyond simple exhaustion.  This might require specific treatment.\n\n\n**In short:**  While muscle strain from sleep deprivation is a plausible explanation, you should absolutely discuss this symptom with your neurologist or other healthcare provider involved in managing your conditions.  They can conduct a proper examination and determine the underlying cause.  Don't hesitate to bring up all your concerns and medical history to ensure a comprehensive assessment.  They can help determine if further testing is needed.\n"

It's crucial to find a healthcare professional who listens to your concerns and takes your descriptions seriously.  While I can't give medical advice, here's what I strongly recommend:\n\n**1.  Document Everything:** Before your GP appointment, write down everything you've described. Include:\n\n* **Detailed description of the head jerks:** When they started, how often they occur, exactly what they feel like (the electric pulse, location, grunting sound, etc.), how long they last, any triggers, and how they impact your daily life.\n* **Impact of medication:** Note how your medication affects the frequency and severity of the head jerks.  Be specific about the changes you notice when you're on and off your medication.\n* **Recent changes:**  Detail the changes you've experienced in the past week due to lack of sleep and illness, including the building pressure and difficulty breathing.\n* **Other symptoms:**  Include any other symptoms you experience alongside the head jerks (e.g., dizziness, changes in vision, confusion, etc.).\n* **Timeline:** Keep a detailed log of when these events happen for a few days leading up to your appointment.\n\n\n**2. Your GP Appointment:**  This is your opportunity to advocate for yourself.  Bring your written documentation to your appointment. Clearly explain your concerns to your GP, focusing on the discrepancies between the absence seizure diagnosis and your experience.  Explain the new symptoms, emphasizing the building pressure and breathing difficulties.  \n\n* **Request a referral:** Ask your GP for a referral to a *different* neurologist, preferably one specializing in epilepsy who is known for listening carefully to patient concerns.  Explain your dissatisfaction with your current neurologist.\n* **Request further investigation:** Ask your GP to order tests (EEG, possibly MRI) to get a clearer picture of what's happening.  These tests can help rule out other conditions and provide a more accurate diagnosis.\n* **Discuss medication side effects:**  Talk about the potential of your current medications contributing to or worsening your symptoms.\n\n**3.  Consider a Second Opinion (even before the GP appointment):** If you can, try to find a neurologist specializing in epilepsy for a second opinion, regardless of your GP's response. This is especially important given your concerns about the initial diagnosis and the potential seriousness of the worsening symptoms.\n\n**4.  Communicate with your current neurologist (if you want to):**  Before seeking a second opinion, you could write a letter or email to your current neurologist detailing your concerns.  However, based on your description, this might not be effective given their past responses.\n\n**Important Note:** The worsening symptoms (pressure, difficulty breathing, pain) warrant immediate attention. Your GP can assess the urgency of the situation and decide if you need to be seen sooner or if additional tests are needed immediately.  Don't hesitate to seek urgent medical care if your symptoms become significantly worse.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that you have a right to receive appropriate medical care and a healthcare provider who listens to your concerns. Be persistent and don't give up until you receive a diagnosis and treatment plan that you feel confident in.\n"

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your experience is concerning and warrants further investigation.  The neurologist's dismissal, particularly without witnessing the event and relying solely on a normal EEG, is troubling.  A normal EEG doesn't rule out many neurological conditions.  The sequential nature of your symptoms (eye closure, near-syncope, leg spasms, hand tingling, facial twitching/numbness, weakness) strongly suggests a neurological issue, not simply anxiety.\n\nHere's why I'm concerned and what needs to be considered:\n\n* **Sequential symptoms:** The precise sequence and timing of symptoms point to a specific neurological pathway being affected.  Anxiety rarely presents with such a well-defined, patterned progression.\n* **Negative biopsy but enlarged lymph node:** The enlarged hilar lymph node, even with a negative biopsy, remains a significant red flag.  Lymph nodes enlarge in response to infection or inflammation, and sometimes malignancy.  It's possible the biopsy missed something, or there's an underlying inflammatory process affecting the nervous system.\n* **Neurological deficit:** The inability to lift your legs suggests a temporary neurological deficit, which is not typical of a psychogenic seizure.\n* **Dismissal by neurologist:**  The neurologist's response is inadequate and dismissive. A proper neurological workup is crucial.\n* **Possible Video Evidence:** The video could be incredibly helpful in providing objective evidence of your symptoms.  Consider uploading it to a secure online platform (like a cloud storage service with password protection) and sharing the link with a neurologist or your primary care physician.\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion:**  Absolutely get a second opinion from a different neurologist, ideally one specializing in neurological disorders that could present with such symptoms.\n2. **Detailed medical history:** Provide a detailed account of your symptoms, including the timeline of events leading up to the enlarged lymph node.  Mention the lymph node itself, as this is crucial information.\n3. **Further investigations:**  Advocate for further testing, including:\n    * **MRI of the brain and cervical spine:** To rule out structural abnormalities, lesions, or inflammation.\n    * **More detailed neurological exam:** A thorough exam by a neurologist experienced with complex neurological issues.\n    * **Further evaluation of the hilar lymph node:** Perhaps a repeat biopsy or other imaging studies (PET scan, CT scan).\n    * **Blood tests:** To check for infections, inflammatory markers, or autoimmune diseases.\n    * **Possible EMG/NCS:** Electromyography and nerve conduction studies to evaluate nerve function.\n    * **Repeat EEG, possibly with video EEG monitoring:**  This will allow for continuous EEG monitoring during a symptom episode.\n\nDon't let the initial neurologist's opinion dissuade you from seeking thorough medical attention.  Your symptoms are serious and warrant a comprehensive investigation. The video evidence is crucial for demonstrating the objective nature of your symptoms.  Your persistence and advocacy for your health are essential.\n"

        "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The fact that your son is experiencing new symptoms (closing his eyes and shaking his head) in addition to the pre-existing tremors, and *especially* given the history of a seizure, means you **absolutely need to contact your son's neurologist or pediatrician immediately.**  Do not delay.\n\nWhile teething can cause discomfort and sometimes unusual facial expressions, the combination of tremors, a previous seizure, and the new behavior of eye closing and head shaking warrants immediate medical attention. It's crucial for a medical professional to assess your son's situation in person.  They can determine if this is related to the tremors, a new neurological issue, or something else entirely.  Guessing about the cause is dangerous and could potentially delay necessary treatment.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment as soon as possible.  If you feel this is an emergency situation, do not hesitate to take him to the nearest emergency room.\n"

        "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",

        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot interpret your EEG results.  Providing a medical interpretation based on your translated EEG report is beyond my capabilities and would be irresponsible and potentially harmful.  Your neurologist's referral to an epileptologist is the correct course of action.\n\nYour description of your symptoms (episodic fatigue, disorientation, concentration difficulty, trembling, and a general feeling of \"weirdness\") *could* be associated with various neurological conditions, including epilepsy, but also many others.  Only a qualified medical professional can properly assess your EEG and symptoms to reach a diagnosis.\n\nThe EEG report mentions several things that are potentially concerning:\n\n* **\"Moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity\":** This refers to the brain's normal electrical activity.  The description suggests some abnormality in the rhythm and stability of this activity.\n* **\"Individual, slower, interrupting waves\":**  These slower waves can be indicative of various neurological issues.\n* **\"Discontinuous dysrhythmias\":** This is a term referring to irregular patterns in the brainwave activity, which is a significant finding.\n* **\"Isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes\":** Sharp waves are often associated with seizure activity, though a single finding doesn't confirm epilepsy.\n* **Regional localization:** The report notes the abnormalities are concentrated in specific brain areas (temporal and frontal lobes). This is important information for localization of potential issues.\n\n\n**However,  interpreting these findings requires the expertise of a neurologist specializing in epilepsy.**  They will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the EEG results as a whole to make a diagnosis.

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "You've presented a complex case with multiple medications interacting, and rightly raise concerns about potential side effects, particularly the risk of seizures.  While I can't provide medical advice, I can offer some points to discuss with your psychiatrist:\n\n**Key Concerns and Discussion Points:**\n\n* **Seizure Risk:**  The potential for lowered seizure threshold with this combination of medications is a serious concern.  The fact that your psychiatrist suggested doubling doses without explicitly addressing this risk is worrying.  You need a frank discussion about this. Ask specifically:\n    * What is the assessed risk of seizure based on *your* individual factors (family history, existing conditions, etc.)?  A family history absence is helpful, but isn't a guarantee.\n    * What monitoring strategy (e.g., EEG) would be appropriate to mitigate this risk?\n    * Are there alternative medications or dosages that could achieve the same therapeutic effects with a lower seizure risk?\n* **Trazodone's Role:** Trazodone is primarily an antidepressant, but often used off-label for sleep.  Its effectiveness for sleep diminishes with long-term use, and it's not ideal for chronic insomnia.  Are there other sleep aids with a better long-term profile and fewer interaction risks? Your physician should address the need for a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Perhaps you could benefit from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) which has shown efficacy in chronic insomnia, and does not carry the same risk profile as the medications you currently use.\n* **Medication Optimization:**  Your medication regimen is complex.  It's essential to evaluate if each medication is truly necessary and contributing positively to your overall well-being.  Perhaps some medications can be reduced or discontinued, simplifying the regimen and minimizing interactions.\n* **Adderall and Wellbutrin Interaction:** The interaction between Adderall (amphetamine-based stimulant) and Wellbutrin (bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) is significant. Both increase dopamine and norepinephrine.  This could be contributing to your high heart rate, and increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Your current regimen might be contributing to your anxiety and impacting your sleep. The physician should review the current combination and possibly consider alternatives.\n* **Klonopin Use:** While Klonopin (clonazepam) is effective for anxiety, daily or near-daily use for sleep is not ideal due to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal risks.  It should be used sparingly. Consider alternatives that don't carry the risk of addiction like CBT-I or other non-addictive sleep aids if needed.  Ask about a taper plan if you wish to decrease your Klonopin usage.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  Your description of orthostatic hypotension warrants investigation.  Dehydration and suppressed appetite may be contributing factors, but the medications themselves could also play a role.  This needs careful assessment.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Document your concerns meticulously:** Write down all your questions and concerns to bring to your appointment.\n2. **Schedule a thorough appointment:** This isn't a quick chat.  You need ample time for a detailed discussion of your concerns, medication review, and potential adjustments.  Be prepared to discuss your reasoning with evidence from credible sources.\n3. **Consider a second opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the response from your current psychiatrist, seek a second opinion from a specialist in sleep medicine or psychopharmacology.\n\nRemember: You're advocating for your own health. Your extensive medical knowledge is an asset in this process, but it doesn't replace the expertise of a licensed physician.  Use your knowledge to ask informed questions and collaborate with your doctor, not to dictate treatment.  The goal is a collaborative approach that ensures your safety and well-being.\n"

I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to give you medical advice.  While you haven't experienced seizures while playing similar games, the warning on the game is there for a reason:  to protect individuals susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy.  The fact that *you* haven't had a reaction to other games with flashing lights doesn't guarantee you won't have one with this particular game.  The intensity and frequency of the flashing can vary significantly between games.\n\nYour weight and age, and even your current medication, don't eliminate the risk.  The best person to ask about whether it's safe for *you* to play this game is your **neurologist or epileptologist**.  They know your specific medical history and can assess your risk more accurately than anyone else.  They can consider factors such as your medication, your seizure history, and the specific characteristics of the game's flashing lights.\n\nPlaying the game despite the warning is a risk you should discuss with your doctor.

        "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned, especially given your cousin's history.  The symptoms you describe \u2013 brief episodes of unresponsiveness, staring, followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking, particularly linked to alcohol consumption and poor sleep \u2013 are concerning and warrant a medical evaluation.\n\nWhile your description doesn't perfectly match a classic grand mal seizure (tonic-clonic seizure), which usually involves loss of consciousness and more prolonged convulsions, it shares some similarities and could potentially represent a different type of seizure or another neurological event.  The fact that you remain somewhat aware but unresponsive suggests it might be an absence seizure (though the motor component is atypical for a pure absence seizure), or possibly something else entirely.\n\nSeveral factors increase the likelihood of needing a proper medical assessment:\n\n* **Family History:** Your cousin's seizures significantly increase your risk of experiencing similar issues.\n* **Alcohol and Sleep Deprivation as Triggers:** These are known triggers for seizures in some individuals.\n* **Progressive Nature (potentially):**  While initially transient, the recent recurrence of these episodes is a red flag.\n* **Associated Motor Tics:** The presence of motor tics might indicate an underlying neurological predisposition.\n* **Unspecified \"recreational drug use\":** Some drugs can lower the seizure threshold.  Precise details of your recreational drug use would be important for a doctor to assess potential interactions or causes.\n\n**You should not attempt to self-diagnose.**  The information provided here is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  **You need to see a doctor or neurologist as soon as possible.**  They can conduct a thorough neurological examination, review your medical history (including your ASD diagnosis and tic disorder), and order appropriate investigations, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor brain activity.  An EEG is the most reliable way to determine if these episodes are seizures.\n\nDelaying a consultation could potentially be risky.  It's better to be proactive and get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan than to worry about the possibility of something serious.  Don't hesitate to mention your cousin's history to your doctor; this is crucial information.\n"

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "answer": "It's impossible for me to diagnose your condition.  Your description of the events strongly suggests you should seek immediate medical evaluation by a neurologist.  The symptoms you describe\u2014the altered consciousness, changes in speech and motor function, unusual sensory experiences (electric shock, heavy head), and the premonitory symptoms (nausea, anger, anxiety)\u2014are concerning and consistent with possible focal seizures.  While migraine aura can present with visual disturbances, the motor and cognitive changes you experienced go beyond typical aura symptoms.\n\n**Why you should see a neurologist urgently:**\n\n* **Your experiences are not normal:** The episodes you've described are not simply zoning out or feeling tired.  The neurological symptoms, particularly the altered consciousness and motor dysfunction, require professional medical assessment.\n* **Potential for serious consequences:**  Seizures can have serious underlying causes that need to be investigated and managed.  Untreated seizures can lead to further complications.\n* **Differential diagnosis:** Your doctor needs to rule out other conditions that could mimic seizures, such as syncope (fainting), transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes), or other neurological problems.\n\n**Addressing your concerns:**\n\n* **\"Making it up for attention\":**  You're clearly distressed and concerned about what you're experiencing. It's understandable to question whether you're imagining things, especially given the emotional impact. However, the consistent nature and severity of your symptoms make it highly unlikely you're fabricating this.\n* **Migraine aura vs. seizures:**  Migraine aura usually involves visual disturbances (lights, blind spots), but rarely the motor and cognitive changes you've described. The combination of symptoms strongly points towards a neurological event requiring a proper diagnosis.\n* **Fatty/sugary food trigger:** Some people with epilepsy find that certain foods can trigger seizures.  This is a detail a neurologist should know.\n* **Weight loss and fatigue:**  Your significant weight loss and decreased running ability could be related to the underlying neurological issue, or an entirely separate medical problem that needs to be investigated.\n* **CBC results:** The normal CBC (apart from vitamin D) doesn't rule out neurological issues, but it's a good starting point.  Further testing (EEG, MRI) will be necessary.\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your doctor immediately.** Explain your symptoms in detail, including the timing, frequency, and associated feelings.  Mention your concerns about seizures and your girlfriend's experience.\n2. **Keep a detailed seizure diary.** Note the date, time, duration, and all symptoms experienced before, during, and after each event.  This will be invaluable for your doctor.  Include things like what you ate, your activity level, and your emotional state.\n3. **Inform your doctor about all medications you take,** including marijuana.\n4. **Be prepared for further testing.** Your doctor might recommend an EEG (to monitor brainwave activity) and/or an MRI (to visualize your brain).\n\nPlease don't delay seeking medical attention. Your health and well-being are paramount.  A neurologist is best equipped to diagnose and manage your condition.\n"

I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won\u2019t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn\u2019t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand your frustration and concern about your EA2 (Episodic Ataxia type 2) diagnosis and treatment.  It's completely reasonable to want to actively participate in decisions about your own healthcare, especially when dealing with a condition as impactful as EA2.  Your desire to explore 4-AP as a potential alternative or addition to your current medication regimen is also understandable.\n\nHowever, I must strongly emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for any specific treatment.\n\n**Regarding 4-AP (4-aminopyridine):**\n\n* **It's a powerful medication:** 4-AP can be effective for some individuals with EA2, but it carries significant potential side effects, including seizures, nausea, dizziness, and changes in heart rate.  These risks need to be carefully weighed against the potential benefits by a neurologist experienced in treating channelopathies like EA2.  Your current symptoms might even contraindicate its use until other factors are addressed.\n* **Individualized treatment is crucial:** The appropriate dose and even the suitability of 4-AP vary greatly depending on individual patient factors.  A neurologist needs to monitor you closely while starting and adjusting the dosage, ensuring the benefits outweigh the risks.\n* **It's not a simple replacement for other medications:**  Simply switching from one medication to another without careful medical supervision can be dangerous. Your current medications, even with their limitations, are currently managing your condition to some degree.  Abruptly stopping prednisone, especially without a replacement strategy, could be harmful.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Find a neurologist specializing in movement disorders or channelopathies:** This is paramount.  A specialist will have a deeper understanding of EA2 and the various treatment options, including the nuances of 4-AP.  Your current neurologist's reluctance to discuss treatment options is concerning.  Actively seek a second opinion.\n2. **Advocate for yourself:**  Be assertive and clearly communicate your concerns and desires to your neurologist. Bring a list of your questions and concerns to appointments.  Explain that you want to be an active participant in your treatment plan.\n3. **Address the insurance issue:**  If the local movement disorder clinic is your only option, persistently work with your insurance company to resolve the coverage issue.  Explore all avenues, including appeals and contacting your insurance representative directly.\n4. **Document everything:** Keep a detailed record of your symptoms, medication dosages, and any interactions with your healthcare providers. This will be invaluable in future discussions and consultations.\n\nYour situation highlights the importance of finding a healthcare provider who is willing to listen to your concerns and work collaboratively with you to develop a treatment plan that aligns with your needs and preferences.  This is crucial for managing a complex condition like EA2 effectively and safely.  Don't hesitate to seek multiple opinions until you find a doctor who meets your needs.\n"

However, your experience shares similarities with several potential phenomena, and it's crucial to consult a medical professional for proper evaluation.  Here are some possibilities to discuss with a doctor or sleep specialist:\n\n* **Sleep paralysis:** This is a common experience where you're awake but unable to move.  The feeling of drowning, the inability to think clearly, and the overwhelming fear align with this. However, the complete loss of inner voice and the cognitive disruption you experienced are less typical of standard sleep paralysis.\n\n* **Hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations:** These are hallucinations that occur as you're falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic).  The \"burning paper\" analogy for your thoughts could be a manifestation of this, although the degree of cognitive impairment you describe goes beyond typical hallucinations.\n\n* **Dissociative episode:**  The feeling of losing control of your thoughts, the sense of unreality, and the emotional flooding could point towards a dissociative episode.  This is a serious condition where you feel detached from yourself or your surroundings.  This should be investigated carefully by a mental health professional.\n\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or other neurological event:** While less likely given the context of sleep, the sudden and profound cognitive impairment warrants consideration. A TIA (mini-stroke) can cause temporary neurological deficits, including confusion and difficulty thinking. This needs *immediate* medical attention to rule out.\n\n* **Sleep disorder (other than sleep paralysis):** There are various sleep disorders that can cause unusual experiences during sleep transitions.  A sleep study (polysomnography) could be helpful in identifying any underlying issues.\n\n* **Medication side effects or substance use:** If you're taking any medications or using substances, these could contribute to such episodes.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **See a doctor immediately:**  The severity and unusual nature of your experience warrant a visit to your physician or a neurologist.  The possibility of a TIA needs to be ruled out urgently.\n\n2. **Keep a sleep diary:**  Record your sleep patterns, any unusual experiences, and any factors that might be contributing (stress, diet, medications). This information will be valuable for your doctor.\n\n3. **Consider a sleep study:** Your doctor may recommend a polysomnography to monitor your brainwaves, heart rate, and other physiological functions during sleep to identify any underlying sleep disorders.\n\n4. **Seek mental health support:**  If your doctor suspects a dissociative disorder or other mental health condition, they will likely refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\n\nDo not attempt to self-diagnose.

I pee 2-4 times in the night even if I don\u2019t drink after 9:30pm.Sometimes I can feel myself \u201cshutting down\u201d, or falling asleep and my body starting to paralyze. I hear crazy noises (exploding head syndrome). Mostly 1-3 times i am in a dream and cannot move my body at all. Feels like a magnet is preventing me from moving my head left to right. I\u2019m crying and screaming to lift a finger.It is so exhausting. I wake up fatigued and usually anxious. My brain fools me into thinking I\u2019m free the first time, but then I\u2019m paralyzed again. This is normal dreams + nightmares.I have major depression and anxiety. I heard that epilepsy can make you feel paralyzed in your sleep, and have trouble with memory. I have short-term memory loss past few years. I never have bruises or anything though. Please help!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of sleep paralysis and potentially other sleep-related issues, compounded by your existing depression and anxiety.  The description you've given strongly suggests sleep paralysis, which is the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up.  The exploding head syndrome, feeling of paralysis, and the intense fear are all classic symptoms.  The fact that this has been happening for a decade is significant.\n\nHowever,  your mention of short-term memory loss and the possibility of epilepsy raises serious concerns that require professional medical evaluation.  While sleep paralysis is relatively common, it's crucial to rule out other underlying conditions.  Exploding head syndrome itself isn't typically associated with serious conditions but co-occurring with sleep paralysis and memory issues warrants further investigation.\n\n**Here's what you should do:**\n\n1. **See a doctor immediately:**  Do not delay.  Make an appointment with your primary care physician or a neurologist as soon as possible.  Explain all your symptoms in detail, including the frequency and duration of sleep paralysis, the memory problems, and the anxiety and depression.  The doctor can perform a physical exam and order tests to rule out any neurological conditions like epilepsy, sleep disorders (other than sleep paralysis), or other potential causes of your symptoms.\n\n2. **Keep a sleep diary:**  For the next week or two, meticulously track your sleep patterns. Note the times you go to bed and wake up, how many times you wake up to urinate, any unusual sensations during sleep (including sleep paralysis episodes), and your overall mood and energy levels throughout the day.  This information will be invaluable to your doctor.\n\n3. **Mention your medications:**  Inform your doctor about your Zyrtec usage. While unlikely to be a direct cause, it's important to disclose all medications you're taking.\n\n4. **Consider a sleep study:** Your doctor might recommend a polysomnography (sleep study) to monitor your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and other physiological functions during sleep.  This can help identify any underlying sleep disorders.\n\n**It's crucial to understand:** I am an AI and cannot diagnose medical conditions.

        "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're anxious about the potential for ongoing blood tests.  Since both Keppra (levetiracetam) and Topamax (topiramate) are primarily cleared by the kidneys, it's highly probable that your neurologist will want to monitor your kidney function in addition to your liver function.\n\nHere's how it's likely to play out:\n\n* **Continuation of LFTs:**  Given your past high LFTs (liver function tests) related to Tegretol, it's almost certain that they'll continue monitoring your liver function.  This is standard practice when starting new AEDs that have a potential to affect the liver, even if the effect was with a different medication.  They want to make sure the new medications aren't causing similar problems.\n\n* **Addition of a Renal Panel:** This is the most likely addition. A renal panel assesses kidney function, including things like creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and possibly glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  These tests are crucial because the drugs are processed by your kidneys.  Elevated levels in these tests could indicate kidney impairment or damage, impacting the effectiveness and safety of your medication.\n\n* **Possible Continuation of CBC/FBC:**  A complete blood count (CBC or FBC) is a broad assessment of your blood cells.  It's often included as part of routine monitoring for patients on AEDs, as some can affect blood cell production.  Whether it continues depends on your individual history and the doctor's assessment.\n\n* **Therapeutic Drug Levels (TDLs) for Keppra and Topamax:** While less common for Keppra, especially at therapeutic doses and for TDLs for Topamax, there is  a chance,  your neurologist might want to check the levels of Keppra and Topamax in your blood to ensure they're within the therapeutic range and achieving optimal seizure control without causing toxicity.  This depends on your response to the medication and whether you're experiencing any side effects.\n\n**In short:**  Expect your blood tests to include LFTs, a renal panel, and possibly a CBC/FBC. TDLs are less likely, but possible depending on the circumstances.  The frequency of these tests (e.g., every 3 months, 6 months, annually) will also be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to treatment.\n\n**It's crucial to discuss your concerns directly with your neurologist or nurse practitioner.**  Don't hesitate to ask them specifically what blood tests they plan to order and why, along with the frequency of testing.  Open communication is key to managing your epilepsy effectively and safely.\n"

        "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm very sorry to hear about your son's infantile spasm and the anxiety you're experiencing.  It's completely understandable that you're seeking a quicker diagnosis and treatment.\n\nRegarding your question about 23andMe and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC):  While 23andMe does test for some genetic variants, it **does not comprehensively screen for all the genetic mutations that can cause TSC.**  TSC is caused by mutations in either the *TSC1* or *TSC2* genes, and there's a wide range of possible mutations within those genes.  23andMe's tests look at a subset of common variations; they may not detect rarer mutations or all possible disease-causing variants in these genes.  Therefore, a negative result on a 23andMe report doesn't rule out TSC.\n\nA proper diagnosis of TSC requires a thorough clinical evaluation by a specialist (neurologist, geneticist) and potentially specific genetic testing focusing on the *TSC1* and *TSC2* genes.  This more targeted testing will have a much higher likelihood of identifying a mutation if one is present.\n\n**Focus on the EEG and Neurological Evaluation:**  Your immediate priority is the EEG. While seeking a quicker EEG in the US is understandable given your concerns, make sure the EEG is done by a qualified neurologist or in a facility that can accurately interpret the results and follow up with appropriate treatment if necessary.  Discuss your concerns about West syndrome and the potential for TSC with the neurologist. They can guide you on the best course of action and may order further genetic testing if the EEG and other clinical findings suggest it.\n\nDon't rely solely on 23andMe for a diagnosis of a serious condition like TSC.  It can be a helpful tool for some things, but it's not a substitute for medical evaluation and professional genetic testing.  Consult with your son's doctors regarding the next steps and share your anxieties with them. They can better advise you on appropriate next steps.\n"

My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your description of your symptoms is concerning and warrants immediate medical attention.  While catamenial epilepsy is a possibility given the timing relative to your menstrual cycle, several other serious conditions need to be ruled out.  The symptoms you describe \u2013 including the feeling of passing out, breathing difficulties (apnea), and the unusual sensations in your head and extremities \u2013 are not typical of simple menstrual cramps and could indicate a neurological or cardiovascular event.  The fact that your symptoms are significantly relieved by Ativan suggests a strong neurological component.\n\n**The following conditions need to be considered and investigated by a medical professional:**\n\n* **Catamenial Epilepsy:** This is epilepsy triggered by hormonal fluctuations related to menstruation. However, the severity and variety of your symptoms go beyond what is typically associated with this condition alone.\n* **Migraine with aura:** The \"waves\" washing over your head could be an aura associated with a severe migraine. The other neurological symptoms could also be related.\n* **Vasovagal syncope:** This is fainting caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. The feeling of passing out and the heart symptoms align with this, but it wouldn't fully explain the neurological symptoms.\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke:** While less likely given your age (assuming you are of reproductive age), the neurological symptoms (tingling, altered mental state, near-fainting) warrant consideration and urgent investigation.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  Several other neurological conditions could cause similar symptoms.\n* **Severe Menstrual Issues:** While you mention less severe vomiting, the intensity of other symptoms suggests that something more serious than typical menstrual cramps is at play.\n\n\n**You should seek immediate medical care.**  Do not wait for your next menstrual cycle.  Go to your doctor or the nearest emergency room.  Bring a detailed record of your symptoms, including the timeline and any triggers you've noticed.

        "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing a cluster of concerning symptoms.  While I can't provide a diagnosis (that requires a medical professional), your description warrants a visit to a doctor or urgent care clinic.\n\nHere's why you should seek medical attention:\n\n* **Painful, swollen lymph node:**  Swollen lymph nodes can indicate infection (bacterial, viral, or even something more serious). The location (occipital, at the base of the skull) and the significant pain make this particularly worrisome.  Self-palpation can also increase inflammation and pain.\n\n* **Severe migraine:** Although Aimovig usually helps, the intensity and duration of your migraine, coupled with the neck and lymph node issues, raise concerns that something else might be contributing.\n\n* **Neck pain limiting movement:**  The pain that prevents you from freely moving your head suggests a possible issue beyond a simple muscle strain.\n\n* **Combination of symptoms:**  The cluster of symptoms (lymphadenopathy, severe migraine, neck pain, and possible acne infection) warrants a professional evaluation to rule out various possibilities.  The fact that the symptoms are primarily on the right side is also noteworthy.\n\n* **No fever:** While the absence of a fever doesn't rule out an infection, it doesn't mean one is absent. Some infections don't present with a fever.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your doctor or go to urgent care ASAP.**  Describe your symptoms completely and honestly.\n\n2. **Mention all your medications.**  This is crucial for your doctor to assess potential interactions or side effects.\n\n3. **Avoid self-treating.**  Do not try to drain or otherwise treat the lymph node yourself.\n\n4. **Rest:** Try to get as much rest as possible while you wait for your appointment.  Use pain relievers as directed by your doctor (avoiding anything that might interact with your current medications).\n\n**Possible causes (this is NOT a diagnosis, only possibilities your doctor should investigate):**\n\n* **Infection:**  Bacterial or viral infection is a strong possibility given the swollen lymph node and other symptoms.\n* **Inflammation:**  Inflammation of the lymph node itself or nearby tissues.\n* **Cervical lymphadenitis:** Inflammation of lymph nodes in the neck.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  While less likely, other neurological conditions need to be ruled out.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.

        "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This situation is extremely concerning and requires immediate medical attention.  Your sister-in-law's presentation is complex and doesn't neatly fit into a single diagnosis. The sudden onset of altered personality, third-person speech, accent changes, childlike behavior, and repetitive phrases strongly suggest a **possible dissociative episode**, potentially triggered by the epilepsy, underlying mental health conditions, or a combination of factors.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why certain possibilities are more likely, and what's concerning:\n\n* **Dissociative Episode:** This is a significant possibility. The dramatic personality shift, altered speech, and apparent loss of self-awareness point towards a dissociative state.  Stress (from the epilepsy diagnosis, seizures, and existing mental health issues) can be a major trigger for such episodes.  The fact that it followed a seizure increases the likelihood of a neurological connection.\n\n* **Epilepsy-Related Psychosis:**  Epilepsy itself can sometimes cause psychotic symptoms, especially during or immediately after a seizure.  The frequency and severity of her seizures recently are worrying.\n\n* **Medication Side Effects/Interaction:**  The interaction between her anti-depressants, sleeping medication, and any new anti-epileptic drugs could be contributing to the altered mental state.  This requires careful review by her doctors.\n\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:** While epilepsy is diagnosed, there could be another, undiagnosed neurological condition exacerbating the situation.  The CT scan and blood tests are crucial in ruling out other possibilities like infections or structural abnormalities.\n\n* **Drug Use (Less Likely Given Circumstances):** While you've ruled out recent external drug use,  it's important for doctors to consider the possibility of a past or undetected substance use disorder, even with her current living situation.  A toxicology screen may be ordered as part of the investigations.\n\n**Why it's urgent:**  The rapid progression of symptoms, including multiple seizures and profound personality changes, is alarming. The immediate medical attention she's receiving is critical.  \n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Gather information:**  Make a list of all medications she's taking (including dosages), the details of her seizures (duration, type of movements, post-ictal state), and a detailed timeline of the events last night.  This will be extremely valuable for the neurologist and any other specialists involved.\n* **Support her family:**  This is an incredibly stressful situation for everyone. Offer emotional support and assistance to your sister-in-law's parents.\n* **Follow up:**  After the neurologist's visit, actively follow up on any tests, diagnoses, and treatment plans. Insist on a thorough investigation into the cause of her altered mental state.  Consider seeking a second opinion if you have any concerns.\n\n**It's crucial to emphasize that this is not something that can be diagnosed online.**  The information provided here is for context and potential areas of investigation.  Her doctors are the only ones qualified to diagnose and treat her condition.  The urgency of the situation necessitates immediate and continued medical attention.\n"

        "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can\u2019t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can\u2019t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it\u2019s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can\u2019t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This situation is extremely concerning and requires urgent medical attention.  The combination of severe photophobia, intractable headache, nausea, vomiting, balance disturbance, confusion, and anisocoria (unequal pupil size) points towards a serious neurological or systemic issue.  The fact that these symptoms are profoundly worsened by standing suggests a possible circulatory or pressure-related component.\n\nDespite the negative results from some tests, the persistent and worsening symptoms demand further investigation.  The previous elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low ceruloplasmin, and low carnitine, while now normalized, warrant continued scrutiny.  The narrow bile ducts noted on CT, even if considered \"not significant,\" deserve further evaluation with the pending MRCP results.\n\n**Here's why immediate action is crucial:**\n\n* **Anisocoria:**  Unequal pupil size is a significant red flag that could indicate a neurological emergency, such as raised intracranial pressure, a brain lesion, or other serious conditions affecting the autonomic nervous system.\n* **Intractable Symptoms:**  The severity and persistence of the symptoms, despite numerous consultations, indicate a potentially serious and progressive underlying condition.\n* **Worsening with Upright Posture:**  This suggests a possible circulatory or orthostatic issue, which could be related to autonomic dysfunction or a cardiovascular problem.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Seek Immediate Medical Attention:**  This is not a situation that can wait. Go to the nearest emergency room or urgent care facility *immediately*. Explain the complete history, including the anisocoria episodes and the worsening symptoms with standing.  Insist on a thorough neurological examination, including a detailed neurological assessment and vital signs monitoring.\n\n2. **Advocate for Further Testing:**  While some tests have been done, the following should be strongly considered:\n\n    * **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):**  While meningitis was ruled out by neurologists, given the severity of the symptoms, a lumbar puncture to rule out other intracranial infections or inflammatory conditions is crucial.\n    * **Detailed Neurological Exam:**  This should be performed by a neurologist experienced in diagnosing complex neurological conditions. It should include specific assessments for cranial nerve function, cerebellar function, and autonomic nervous system function.\n    * **Brain and Spine MRI with and without contrast:** While brain MRI showed no abnormalities, a new MRI with and without contrast could be warranted, and adding a spine MRI would be valuable to rule out any spinal cord pathology.\n    * **Complete Metabolic Panel:**  This should include a thorough assessment of electrolytes, renal function, and other metabolic markers.\n    * **Cardiac Evaluation:** Given the symptom worsening with standing, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and potentially other cardiac investigations are necessary.\n    * **Autonomic Nervous System Testing:**  This specialized testing can assess the function of the autonomic nervous system, which plays a crucial role in regulating many bodily functions, including blood pressure and heart rate.  This might explain the orthostatic intolerance.\n\n3. **Wilson's Disease and Porphyria Testing:** You mentioned pending tests for these conditions.  Get these tests done as soon as possible.  The urgency of this situation makes delaying these tests unwise.\n\n4. **Medication History:**  Provide a complete and accurate list of all medications your partner has taken, including those he has stopped, and the reasons for stopping them. This is critical for the physicians to assess potential medication-related side effects or interactions.\n\n\nThis situation demands a multidisciplinary approach.  Your partner needs specialists in neurology, possibly endocrinology and cardiology, and potentially other specialists depending on test results.  Do not hesitate to seek second and third opinions if necessary.  Persistent advocacy for further investigation is essential.  His life may depend on it.\n"

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

        "answer": "I understand your fear and desperation.  This is an incredibly difficult situation, and it's completely understandable that you're seeking any information or hope you can find.  Unfortunately, I cannot provide medical advice or diagnosis.  I am an AI and not a medical professional.  The information I provide below is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical guidance.\n\n**What you've described is a severe and life-threatening medical emergency.**  The fact that your fianc\u00e9e is experiencing Status Epilepticus Refractory to Standard Treatment (SRSE) is extremely serious.  The prolonged seizure activity is causing significant damage to her brain and other organs.  The medical team's actions \u2013 intubation, sedation, multiple medications, and now considering a barbiturate coma \u2013 are all appropriate steps in managing this crisis.\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Concerns:**\n\n* **Possible Causes:**  The fact that the underlying cause remains unknown is frustrating but not uncommon in SRSE.  While the negative lumbar punctures rule out some infections, the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis or other rare neurological conditions remains.  The insect bites *could* be relevant, depending on whether they introduced an infection (though the negative tests suggest otherwise), but it's more likely coincidental.  The positive Babinski reflex you observed earlier is concerning in retrospect, but without further investigation, it\u2019s impossible to draw any conclusions.  The extensive testing is crucial to finding the root cause.\n\n* **Prognosis:**  Predicting the long-term outcome of SRSE is impossible at this stage.  The severity and duration of the seizures significantly impact the potential for neurological damage.  The barbiturate coma is a high-risk, high-reward approach; it aims to stop the seizures and give the brain a chance to recover, but it also carries significant risks.  The fact that they are considering it underlines the gravity of the situation.  Recovery, if it happens, could range from full recovery to severe cognitive and physical impairments.  Complete recovery after this level of brain insult is *possible*, but it's by no means certain.\n\n* **Mental Functioning:**  The length and frequency of seizures dramatically increase the risk of significant brain damage.  Whether she retains any mental functioning will depend on the extent of that damage, which can't be accurately assessed until the seizures are controlled and she awakens.\n\n* **Allopregnanolone:**  The study you mention is promising, but it's a very small sample size.  The doctors are likely aware of this and other research; they're working within established protocols while exploring all available options.  Suggesting specific treatments is something only her medical team should do.\n\n* **Experimental Ideas:**  I cannot suggest experimental treatments.  Only her medical team can determine if experimental or off-label medications are appropriate, given her specific situation and potential risks.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n* **Support the Medical Team:**  Work closely with the medical team.  Ask clarifying questions, but don't challenge their judgment.  Their expertise is vital.\n* **Maintain Open Communication:**  Stay informed about her progress and any changes in her treatment plan.\n* **Seek Support for Yourself:**  This is an incredibly stressful time.  Find support groups for caregivers of individuals with neurological conditions.  Consider seeking therapy to cope with the emotional toll.\n* **Document Everything:**  Keep a detailed record of her symptoms, seizures, medications, and responses to treatments.  This is valuable for the medical team and for your own peace of mind.\n\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint.  Focus on supporting your fianc\u00e9e and trusting the medical professionals.  Your love and presence are crucial during this incredibly difficult time.  Keep searching for support groups and resources for families facing similar situations.  They can offer invaluable emotional support and practical advice.  Remember that you are not alone.\n"

        "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Let's break down the medical terminology from your neurologist's report.  It's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace consultation with your doctor or neurologist.\n\n**1. Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone:**\n\n* **Ventricular trigone:** This refers to a part of the lateral ventricle (fluid-filled cavities in the brain).\n* **Dilatation:** Means widening or enlargement.\n* **Ex-vacuo:** This crucial term means the enlargement is due to a loss of surrounding brain tissue.  The ventricle is widening *because* there's less brain tissue pressing against it.  This is a secondary finding, a consequence of the brain atrophy (tissue loss) elsewhere.  It's not the primary problem, but rather a visible sign of brain tissue shrinkage in a nearby area.\n\n**2. T2-weighted high-signal gliosis:**\n\n* **T2-weighted:** This refers to a specific type of MRI sequence.  Different sequences highlight different tissue properties.  T2-weighted images are particularly sensitive to water content.\n* **High-signal:**  On a T2-weighted image, \"high signal\" appears bright.  Bright areas in this context often indicate edema (swelling), inflammation, or gliosis.\n* **Gliosis:** This is a reactive process where glial cells (support cells in the brain) proliferate (multiply) in response to injury or damage to the brain.  It's essentially scar tissue in the brain.  The location (periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe) suggests the gliosis is a result of previous damage in that area.\n\n**3. Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus:**\n\nThe hippocampus is a crucial area of the brain involved in memory formation and spatial navigation.  \"Abnormalities\" in this context, given the other findings, likely refer to:\n\n* **Right-sided Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS):** This is a significant finding. MTS is a condition where the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe structures (in the right side of your brain in your case) show sclerosis (hardening and scarring) due to repeated seizures.  It's a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\n* **Associated regional atrophy:** Atrophy means shrinking or wasting away of tissue.  The atrophy associated with the hippocampal abnormalities means the surrounding brain tissue in the right temporal lobe has also atrophied likely due to the ongoing effects of seizures and/or the underlying cause of your epilepsy.\n\n**4. Associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus:**\n\nThe thalamus acts as a relay station for sensory information.  Atrophy here suggests damage to the thalamus, likely secondary to the problems in the hippocampus and surrounding areas.\n\n**5. Periventricular white matter:**\n\nThis is *not* damage in itself, but a location.  The periventricular white matter is the white matter (primarily myelinated nerve fibers) that surrounds the ventricles of the brain.  The gliosis described is *in* this location, indicating that the injury leading to the gliosis occurred in this area.\n\n\n**In summary:**  Your MRI shows evidence of right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) as the primary problem, leading to atrophy in the hippocampus and surrounding areas, including the thalamus.  The gliosis in the periventricular white matter is likely a result of a previous injury, possibly related to your epilepsy or an unrelated event.  The ventricular dilatation is a secondary effect caused by the loss of brain tissue.\n\nAgain, this is just an interpretation of the medical terms.  It's crucial to discuss these findings and their implications with your neurologist. They can explain the specifics of your case, potential treatments, and manage your epilepsy effectively.\n"

        "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This sounds like a very serious and complex situation requiring urgent medical attention.  The constellation of symptoms you're describing \u2013 sudden onset lazy eye progressing to severe deviation, fluctuating eye dominance, breathing difficulties, seizures, tremors, flushing, color changes in extremities, severe vertigo with nystagmus and vomiting, oscillopsia, and fluctuating eye muscle control \u2013 points to a potentially life-threatening neurological condition that needs immediate investigation beyond the initial myasthenia gravis assessment.\n\nThe negative myasthenia gravis antibody test doesn't rule out other neuromuscular junction disorders or other neurological problems entirely. The fact that your symptoms worsened after the negative test is highly concerning.  The dismissal of your concerns by your neurologist after a negative antibody test is troubling, especially given the severity and progression of your symptoms.\n\nHere's why you need further investigation urgently:\n\n* **Sudden onset neurological deficits:** The rapid onset and progression of your symptoms (lazy eye, seizures, vertigo, tremors) are red flags for potentially serious underlying conditions.\n* **Multiple system involvement:**  Your symptoms affect your eyes, nervous system (seizures, tremors, vertigo), respiratory system (shallow breathing), and autonomic nervous system (flushing, color changes). This suggests a systemic issue rather than isolated problems.\n* **Oscillopsia and severe vertigo:** This combination is particularly concerning and can be indicative of serious inner ear or brainstem pathology.  The fact that the MRI of your vestibular system was normal doesn't necessarily rule out all possibilities; other imaging modalities might be necessary.\n* **Discrepancy in diagnoses:** The differing opinions on your vertigo (anterior vertigo vs. oscillopsia) highlights the need for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n* **Lack of adequate investigation:** The neurologist's decision to halt investigation after a single negative antibody test is insufficient given the severity and complexity of your presentation.\n\n**You need to:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion immediately.**  Find a neurologist or a neuromuscular specialist at a major medical center or university hospital. Explain your entire symptom history in detail, emphasizing the progression and severity of your symptoms.\n2. **Advocate for further testing.**  You need more comprehensive neurological investigations, potentially including:\n    * **Detailed neurological examination:** A thorough assessment by a specialist focusing on cranial nerves, reflexes, and muscle strength.\n    * **Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG/NCS):** These tests can help assess the function of nerves and muscles.\n    * **Brain MRI with contrast:** A more detailed brain MRI may reveal lesions or abnormalities not detected in the vestibular MRI.\n    * **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis:** This may be helpful in identifying certain neurological conditions.\n    * **Other blood tests:**  A broader panel of autoimmune or inflammatory markers might be warranted.\n    * **Autonomic nervous system testing:**  Given the flushing and color changes, this might be useful.\n\n3. **Document everything:** Keep a detailed log of your symptoms, including the time of onset, duration, and severity. This will be invaluable for your new medical team.\n\nYour current situation is extremely serious, and delaying further investigation could have severe consequences.  Do not hesitate to seek immediate and aggressive medical intervention.  Insist on further testing and a thorough evaluation. Your life may depend on it.\n"

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your theory that the Keppra was masking underlying epilepsy, making the PNES more apparent once it was discontinued, is plausible, though not definitively provable without further testing.  The fact that the hallucinations, a symptom initially associated with the suspected schizophrenia/then epilepsy, have returned after stopping Keppra strongly supports this possibility.  The 10-25% comorbidity rate you cite for PNES and epilepsy further strengthens this line of thinking.\n\nHere's why it makes sense and some considerations:\n\n* **Keppra's Broad Spectrum:** Keppra (levetiracetam) is a broad-spectrum anti-seizure medication. It can affect different types of seizures and even some non-seizure neurological activity.  It's possible it was suppressing both epileptic activity *and* some underlying neurological processes contributing to her hallucinations, even if those weren't directly caused by epilepsy.\n\n* **Masking Effect:**  Sometimes, one condition can mask another.  The more prominent symptoms of epilepsy (or what was *thought* to be epilepsy) might have overshadowed the PNES symptoms while she was on Keppra.  Removing Keppra removed the masking effect, revealing the PNES more clearly.\n\n* **Withdrawal Effects:** While less likely to be the sole cause of the hallucination return, Keppra withdrawal can sometimes cause neurological symptoms, although usually not hallucinations of this nature.  This is a less likely explanation given the timing and the specific symptom reappearance.\n\n* **PNES and Underlying Conditions:**  PNES is often associated with underlying psychological conditions like trauma, anxiety, and depression.  The stressors leading to these conditions could still be present, contributing to both the PNES and the hallucinations, even with the Keppra.\n\n**Why the hallucinations came back:** The most likely reason is the removal of the Keppra's suppressive effects on whatever underlying neurological process was contributing to the hallucinations, whether that was directly related to epilepsy or an independent factor.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Advocate for your wife:**  The long wait times are frustrating, but you need to strongly advocate for faster appointments with both the neurologist and neuropsychologist.  Explain the urgent return of hallucinations and the potential for a missed diagnosis.\n\n* **Document Everything:**  Keep detailed records of all symptoms, their frequency, duration, and any triggers. This information is crucial for her doctors.\n\n* **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you feel the current treatment plan isn't addressing the issue adequately, consider seeking a second opinion from a different neurologist or epileptologist specializing in PNES.\n\n* **Focus on Psychological Support:**  While awaiting appointments, ensure your wife has access to psychological support to manage her anxiety and other mental health needs.  This is crucial regardless of the underlying cause of the hallucinations.\n\n\nIn short, your theory is reasonable and warrants further investigation.  The reappearance of hallucinations after Keppra discontinuation is a significant piece of the puzzle.  Persistent advocacy and detailed documentation will be key to getting your wife the proper diagnosis and treatment.\n"

        "question": " Hi, I bit of back story here I've been diagnostic with NF1 when I was 5 ever since I had to do 2 MRI every year. every time they put a needle in my arm I would faint.So today I just got my blood draw for a schedule MRI in 3 weeks. And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What you experienced sounds like a vasovagal syncope episode complicated by what appears to be a seizure-like event (the uncontrollable movement of your arms and legs).  Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the most likely primary cause of your fainting.  It's a common reaction to stressful or painful stimuli, like needle sticks.  It happens because your nervous system overreacts, causing your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly, leading to a lack of blood flow to your brain.  The needle stick is a trigger, and the anxiety surrounding it likely exacerbates the response.\n\n* **Secondary Seizure-like Event:** The uncontrollable movement of your limbs *after* the fainting suggests something beyond simple vasovagal syncope.  While fainting itself can sometimes involve brief, involuntary muscle spasms, the description you give points towards a different phenomenon. This could be a few things:\n\n    * **Convulsive Syncope:**  This is a type of syncope where the fainting is accompanied by convulsions or jerking movements.  It's often misdiagnosed as a seizure.\n    * **Reflex Seizures (or Reflex Epilepsy):** These are seizures triggered by specific events, like pain, stress, or even a change in posture. Your needle-stick phobia, combined with the pain and anxiety, could have triggered a reflex seizure.\n    * **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**  These are neurological events that mimic epileptic seizures but originate from psychological factors rather than brain electrical activity.  Stress and anxiety are major factors.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **NF1 and Neurological Issues:** Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can sometimes be associated with increased risk of certain neurological conditions, although it's not directly causative in most cases.  Your doctor should be aware of this.\n* **Medication Effects:** Are you on any medications? Some medications can influence fainting or seizure activity.\n* **Underlying Heart Conditions:**  While less likely, it's important to rule out any underlying cardiac issues that could contribute to fainting.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\nThis is *crucial*: **You need to report this episode to your doctor immediately.**  The fact that you experienced involuntary movements alongside your fainting is a significant change and needs prompt medical evaluation.  They will likely order further tests, possibly including an EKG (electrocardiogram), to assess your heart function, and potentially a neurological consultation to investigate the seizure-like episode.  They may also want to explore ways to mitigate your anxiety and pain during future medical procedures.\n\nDo not attempt to self-diagnose.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your description and the provided link, it's highly unlikely your mild scalp ridging is Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG).  The article you linked describes a severe, congenital (present from birth) condition often associated with significant neurological and developmental delays.  Your situation is different; your scalp changes appeared *after* hair loss due to chemotherapy, suggesting a possible reaction or a previously unseen feature now visible.\n\nThe fact that your scalp ridges are mild and developed later in life makes CVG a very low probability.  The association with mental retardation mentioned in that article is specifically related to the severe, congenital form.\n\nYour current health concerns are significant and complex:\n\n* **IBS-like symptoms from adhesions:** Requires gastroenterological evaluation.\n* **Non-epileptic seizures from migraines:** Requires neurological monitoring and management.\n* **Breast cancer and TCHP chemo:** Requires ongoing oncologic care.\n* **Deafness (attributed to seizures):** Requires audiological assessment and management.\n* **Mild scalp ridging:** This is the least concerning of your problems.\n\n**Instead of an endocrinologist,** I recommend discussing the scalp ridging with your **oncologist** or your **primary care physician**. They are best equipped to consider this in the context of your other health conditions, especially the chemotherapy. The changes might be a side effect of the chemotherapy, a coincidental finding, or something entirely unrelated.  They can also refer you to a dermatologist if necessary for further evaluation.\n\nFocusing on your more pressing medical issues (cancer treatment, seizure management, IBS symptoms, hearing loss) is crucial.  The scalp ridging, given its mild nature and late onset, is likely less important in the immediate context of your health.\n"

        "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable to have concerns about increasing your son's medication dosage, especially when it seems to be working well at the current level.  Your concerns are valid and reflect a responsible parent's perspective.  However, the reasoning behind increasing the dosage from 2ml to 3ml, even with apparent improvement, is likely based on the neurologist's experience and understanding of epilepsy management. Here's why:\n\n* **Goal of Seizure Control:** The ultimate goal isn't just to reduce seizure frequency, but to completely eliminate them if possible.  Even \"minor\" episodes of dizziness and needing to sit down are still considered seizure activity and can potentially progress.  The neurologist wants to proactively prevent future, potentially more significant, seizures.\n\n* **Therapeutic Window:**  Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) like Keppra have a \"therapeutic window.\" This means there's a range of dosages where the drug is effective at controlling seizures without causing excessive side effects.  The current 2ml dosage might be at the lower end of that window for your son. Increasing it slightly might move him into a more optimal range for complete seizure control.\n\n* **Individual Response:**  Every individual responds differently to AEDs. What works for one person may not work optimally for another.  Even though your son is experiencing improvement at 2ml, a slightly higher dose might be necessary to reach the point where his brainwave activity is consistently normalized and seizures are completely prevented.\n\n* **Prophylactic Approach:**  In epilepsy management, doctors often take a proactive approach to prevent future seizures rather than simply reacting to them.  Increasing the dosage now, while things are relatively stable, is a preventative measure aimed at avoiding a potential relapse or worsening of symptoms.\n\n* **Titration:**  Increasing the dosage gradually is a common practice with AEDs. It's a process of \"titration\" \u2013 finding the optimal dose for your son by carefully monitoring his response and adjusting the dosage accordingly.  The increase from 2ml to 3ml is likely a relatively small step in this titration process.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Discuss your concerns openly with your neurologist:**  Explain your understanding of the current situation and your reservations about the dosage increase. Ask specific questions about the rationale behind the increase, the potential side effects of the higher dose, and how frequently they will monitor your son's progress.\n* **Keep a detailed seizure diary:**  This will help your neurologist track your son's response to the medication and make informed decisions about future adjustments.  Note the date, time, duration, and severity of any episodes, as well as any other observations (e.g., aura, post-ictal state).\n* **Monitor for side effects:**  Be vigilant in observing your son for any new or worsening side effects.  Report these immediately to your neurologist.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that you are a vital part of your son's healthcare team.  By openly communicating your concerns and actively participating in his treatment, you can ensure he receives the best possible care.  Trusting your neurologist's expertise while simultaneously voicing your concerns is the best approach.\n"

Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're concerned, especially given your history and the location of the swelling.  The good news is that localized lymph node swelling after a tetanus vaccination, particularly near the injection site, is a relatively common and usually harmless side effect.  The swelling is a response of your immune system to the vaccine.\n\nYour rational brain is likely correct in this instance.  The timing coincides perfectly with the tetanus shot, and the location is consistent with a regional lymph node response to the vaccination in your left arm.\n\nHowever, while it's *likely* the tetanus shot,  it's *absolutely crucial* to mention this to your doctor at your upcoming appointment.  They can examine the lump, assess its characteristics (size, consistency, tenderness), and determine if further investigation (such as blood tests or imaging) is necessary.\n\nWhile your past medical history, including Graves' disease and low lymphocyte count, is relevant, it doesn't necessarily make a lymph node reaction to the tetanus shot more sinister.  The slightly high liver value is something your doctor should also review in the context of your overall health.\n\n**In short:**  While a reaction to the tetanus shot is a probable explanation,  don't rely on online information or anyone's opinion (including mine) to self-diagnose.  Seeing your doctor is the only way to get a proper diagnosis and ensure appropriate management.  Delaying medical attention based on online searches can be risky.\n"

This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The fact that you've already contacted your doctor is excellent.  Their advice is the only reliable guidance you should follow in this situation.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general information based on your description.  Missing a dose of anti-epileptic medication, especially when it involves a medication with a relatively short half-life like Vimpat, *does* increase the risk of a breakthrough seizure.  The degree of risk depends on several factors, including:\n\n* **Your individual seizure history:** How frequent are your seizures? How well controlled are they normally?\n* **The severity of your epilepsy:**  Some types of epilepsy are more prone to breakthrough seizures than others.\n* **Your adherence to your medication schedule:**  A single missed dose is less concerning than a pattern of missed doses.\n\nYour concern is understandable given the importance of your week and the driving involved.  The fact that you missed your dose by 3 hours and that Vimpat has a relatively short half-life, makes it more likely that your levels were lower than usual during that time period.  However, it's impossible to say for sure if this will lead to a seizure.\n\n**Until you hear back from your doctor:**\n\n* **Prioritize safety:** Avoid activities that could be dangerous if you have a seizure, especially driving.\n* **Remain calm:** Stress can sometimes trigger seizures.\n* **Observe yourself:** Pay attention to any unusual sensations or changes in your mental state.\n* **Take your next doses as prescribed:**  Get back on your regular schedule immediately.\n\n**Please, wait for your doctor's call.** They have access to your medical history and can assess your specific risk far better than anyone online can.  Following their instructions is crucial for your safety.  This is not a situation where seeking a second opinion online is advisable, as it could delay necessary medical attention.\n"

        "question": "28F. 5'8, 250lbs. White. History of epilepsy, asthma and vitamin D & B12 deficiency. Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling worried and overwhelmed after receiving this news.  An FSH level of 122.2 miu/ml at age 28 is significantly elevated.  While a single high FSH test doesn't definitively diagnose premature ovarian insufficiency (POI),  it's a strong indicator.  POI, sometimes called premature menopause, is the loss of ovarian function before age 40.\n\n**Chances of Spontaneous Return of Function:**\n\nThe chances of your reproductive organs spontaneously restarting function after an FSH level this high are unfortunately low.  While there are rare cases of temporary ovarian suppression that resolve, the severity of your elevated FSH suggests a significant decline in ovarian reserve.  The 6-month absence of menstruation further supports this.\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to POI, and it's often a combination rather than a single cause. Some possibilities include:\n\n* **Genetics:**  Family history of early menopause increases the risk.\n* **Autoimmune diseases:**  Conditions like lupus or thyroid disease can damage the ovaries.  Your asthma might be a factor to consider in this context, though it's not a direct cause in itself.  It's essential to discuss this with your doctor.\n* **Chemotherapy or radiation:**  While you haven't mentioned this, prior exposure can significantly impact ovarian function.\n* **Surgery:**  Past pelvic surgeries could have inadvertently damaged the ovaries.\n* **Viral infections:**  Some viral infections can affect ovarian function.\n* **Idiopathic:**  In many cases (up to 50-75%), no specific cause is identified.\n\nYour history of vitamin D and B12 deficiencies is important, although these deficiencies themselves aren't typically *direct* causes of POI. However, severe deficiencies can sometimes affect overall health and potentially contribute to hormonal imbalances indirectly. Your doctor needs to consider if there's an underlying reason for the deficiencies.  The fact that you're addressing those deficiencies now is positive.\n\n**Lamotrigine and Epilepsy:**  The medication Lamotrigine used to treat epilepsy is *not* typically associated with causing premature menopause directly.  However, epilepsy itself, or potentially other medications you've taken in the past (even over-the-counter), could have contributed to or exacerbated the issue, which would be worth discussing with your doctor.\n\n**Things to be Worried About:**\n\nWhile POI itself isn't life-threatening, it does have implications:\n\n* **Infertility:**  It significantly impacts your ability to conceive naturally.  If you desire children, discussion with a fertility specialist is crucial *soon*.  Options like egg freezing (if you have any viable eggs left) or adoption might be considered.\n* **Hormonal Changes:**  You'll likely experience symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood changes, and decreased libido.  Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) might be recommended to manage these symptoms.\n* **Bone Health:**  Estrogen plays a vital role in bone density.  POI increases the risk of osteoporosis, so monitoring bone health and potentially taking supplements (like calcium and vitamin D) will be important.\n* **Cardiovascular Health:**  Estrogen also protects against heart disease, so managing this risk is essential.\n\n\n**What to Do Now:**\n\n* **Follow up with your PCP:**  The repeat testing is vital to confirm the diagnosis.\n* **Discuss your concerns:**  Don't hesitate to ask your doctor about all your questions and anxieties about the possibilities of your condition and your future.\n* **Consider a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist:** These specialists deal with infertility and hormonal issues related to reproduction. They can perform further testing and provide guidance on fertility options.\n\n\nIt's a challenging situation, but getting a clear diagnosis and understanding your options will empower you to manage your health effectively.  Don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or support groups for people experiencing POI or premature menopause.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you describe\u2014difficulty with writing and spelling, word-finding difficulties (aphasia), increased forgetfulness, and the history of frequent, severe seizures, even with a reduction in frequency\u2014are concerning and warrant a thorough medical evaluation.  Your description of forgetting things and then forgetting that you forgot suggests a possible problem with memory consolidation.  The fact that these new cognitive symptoms have emerged alongside your epilepsy raises the possibility of several things:\n\n* **Epilepsy-related cognitive decline:**  While medication wasn't effective in controlling your seizures, the seizures themselves can cause damage to brain cells over time. This can lead to cognitive difficulties, including problems with memory, language, and executive functions (planning, organization).  The cluster seizures, particularly those where you stopped breathing, are especially concerning, as prolonged lack of oxygen can significantly harm brain tissue.\n\n* **Underlying neurological condition:**  Your epilepsy may be a symptom of a larger underlying neurological condition that is now progressing and causing these additional cognitive problems.  This could be anything from a previously undetected brain abnormality to a slowly developing degenerative process.\n\n* **Medication-induced cognitive effects:** Even though you are currently not taking medication for epilepsy, there is still a small chance that effects from previous medications might be impacting your cognition.\n\n* **Stress and fatigue:** The significant stress related to your epilepsy and its impact on your life could also contribute to your cognitive issues.\n\n\n**It's crucial that you see a neurologist immediately.**  They should:\n\n* **Conduct a thorough neurological exam:** This will assess your reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n* **Order additional neuroimaging:**  An MRI or possibly other advanced imaging techniques could reveal underlying brain abnormalities that were not detected previously.\n* **Review your medical history:**  This includes a detailed account of your seizure history, medications, and current symptoms.\n* **Consider neuropsychological testing:** This would formally assess your cognitive abilities (memory, language, executive function) and help quantify the extent of any decline.\n* **Discuss potential treatment options:** Depending on the findings, options could include different anti-epileptic medications (if appropriate), therapy to address cognitive difficulties, or referral to other specialists.\n\nThe fact that your seizures, while less frequent, still include grand mal seizures and cluster seizures with respiratory arrest makes this a serious situation demanding prompt medical attention. Do not delay seeking help.  Your description suggests a possible worsening of your condition, and early intervention is key to managing this and preventing further cognitive decline.\n"

While you may feel fine now, a significant overdose of any medication, especially an anticonvulsant like Keppra (levetiracetam), can have delayed and potentially severe consequences.  Your feeling \"normal\" now doesn't rule out long-term damage.\n\nThe effects of a Keppra overdose can include:\n\n* **Kidney problems:**  Keppra is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, and a large overdose could strain them.\n* **Liver problems:** Although less common than kidney issues, liver damage is a possibility with significant overdoses.\n* **Brain problems:**  While you didn't experience seizures immediately, there's a risk of long-term neurological effects that might not be immediately apparent.\n* **Other complications:**  Various other systems in your body could be affected, requiring careful monitoring.\n\nRegarding the likelihood of death and the pain involved:  The lethality of a Keppra overdose varies depending on factors like individual metabolism and the presence of other substances.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The red, painful patches on your tongue with a subsequent white ring, coupled with burning sensation and unpleasant taste, are concerning and warrant a proper medical evaluation. While it's impossible to diagnose remotely, several possibilities exist, and some could be related to your existing conditions or medications.  It's *unlikely* to be solely a side effect of good oral hygiene.\n\n**Possible Causes and Related Specialists:**\n\n* **Geographic Tongue (Benign Migratory Glossitis):** This is a relatively common condition characterized by red, smooth patches that migrate across the tongue. The white ring you describe is consistent with this. While often benign, the burning sensation suggests it might be more irritated than usual.  A **dermatologist** or **oral medicine specialist (a dentist with specialized training)** would be best suited to diagnose this.\n\n* **Erythema Migrans (a form of geographic tongue):**  Similar to geographic tongue, but the migration is faster.\n\n\n* **Oral Lichen Planus:** This autoimmune condition can cause lacy white lesions and red, painful patches on the tongue and in the mouth.  Given your SLE (a systemic autoimmune disease), this is a *strong possibility* and needs to be ruled out.  Again, a **dermatologist** or **oral medicine specialist** is crucial here.\n\n* **Inflammatory Response Related to Crohn's or SLE:**  The inflammation associated with your Crohn's disease and SLE could manifest in your mouth.  While less likely to present *exactly* as you describe, it's worth considering.  A **rheumatologist** (for SLE) or **gastroenterologist** (for Crohn's) may be able to comment on this aspect.\n\n* **Medication Side Effect (unlikely but possible):** While less probable given the pattern, a medication interaction or side effect *could* be a contributing factor.  Your doctors should review your medications to check for any potential links.\n\n* **Fungal Infection (Thrush):** Although less likely given your description, a yeast infection (candidiasis or thrush) can sometimes present with similar symptoms. A **general practitioner** or **oral medicine specialist** could diagnose this with a simple examination.\n\n\n**Which Doctor to See First:**\n\nI strongly recommend starting with an **oral medicine specialist**. They are dentists with expertise in diagnosing and treating oral conditions.  They can perform a thorough examination, take a biopsy if needed, and rule out many of the possibilities.  They can also coordinate with your other specialists (rheumatologist, gastroenterologist) if necessary. A dermatologist is a good second opinion if the oral medicine specialist doesn't find a conclusive diagnosis.\n\n**Pain Management (beyond standard painkillers):**\n\n* **Gentle oral hygiene:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and avoid harsh mouthwashes.\n* **Avoid irritating foods:** Spicy, acidic, and hot foods can exacerbate the pain.\n* **Saliva substitutes:** Dry mouth can worsen the burning sensation.\n* **Topical corticosteroids:**  Your doctor might prescribe a corticosteroid mouth rinse or gel to reduce inflammation if an inflammatory condition is suspected.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The images are helpful, but a proper diagnosis requires a clinical examination.  Don't delay seeking professional medical attention.  The persistence and recurring nature of your symptoms require investigation to rule out more serious underlying issues.\n"

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's incredibly distressing to see your cousin suffering and facing such frustrating medical setbacks.  The fact that Fiona's symptoms are persistent, severe, and haven't been diagnosed despite multiple hospital visits is deeply concerning.  While I cannot offer a diagnosis, I can offer some potential avenues for consideration that might help your family advocate for better care:\n\n**Possible Explanations (requiring medical investigation):**\n\n* **Underlying neurological condition:**  Even if not epilepsy, there are many other neurological conditions that can cause seizure-like episodes, migraines, and neurological symptoms like numbness. These could include:\n    * **Functional neurological disorder (FND):**  This involves neurological symptoms that aren't explained by a specific neurological disease.  It's often linked to stress or trauma, but *not* necessarily a sign of mental illness in the traditional sense.  It's crucial to differentiate this from genuine neurological issues, though.\n    * **Migraine variants:**  Some types of migraine can have neurological symptoms far beyond typical headaches.\n    * **Other rare conditions:**  A vast array of rare neurological or autoimmune conditions could be responsible.  A thorough neurological workup is crucial.\n\n* **Medication side effects (despite seeming unlikely):** Although Tylenol is generally safe, even over-the-counter meds can have unusual reactions in some children.  While unlikely given the description, it might be worth considering the possibility of an interaction with another medication (even vitamins or supplements) or a rare allergic reaction.\n\n* **Underlying medical condition mimicking seizures:** Some metabolic disorders, infections, or other systemic illnesses can mimic seizures.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in pediatric epilepsy or movement disorders:**  Philadelphia is a good choice; many top hospitals are located there.  Insist on thorough testing, including:\n    * **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To detect any abnormal brainwave activity.  This may need to be done while Fiona is actively experiencing symptoms.\n    * **MRI (magnetic resonance imaging):** To visualize the brain structure and rule out abnormalities.\n    * **Blood tests:**  To rule out metabolic disorders, infections, or other underlying medical conditions.\n    * **Genetic testing (potentially):** Depending on the results of other tests, this could help identify a rare genetic condition.\n\n2. **Keep detailed records:**  Document *everything*: the time, duration, and specific symptoms of each episode.  Note any triggers (e.g., stress, flashing lights, specific times of day).  This information will be invaluable to doctors.\n\n3. **Advocate for your cousin:** Don't be afraid to question doctors' assessments and insist on further investigation if you feel it's warranted.  Bring a trusted adult to appointments to help you remember details and advocate for Fiona.\n\n4. **Support Fiona:** The constant suffering and lack of diagnosis must be incredibly difficult for her. Offer emotional support, comfort, and understanding.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that the fact doctors haven't found a diagnosis *doesn't* mean there isn't one.  Many neurological conditions are challenging to diagnose. Persistent advocacy and thorough testing are key.  Do not give up.\n"

        "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and overwhelmed right now.  Waiting for a neurologist's appointment is agonizing when dealing with something like this.  Let's try to break down the MRI report and address your questions.\n\n**Understanding the MRI Findings:**\n\n* **\"Interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele...\"** This confirms the successful removal of the encephalocele.  The \"tegmen mastoideum\" refers to the bony roof of the middle ear, which is sometimes involved in encephaloceles.\n\n* **\"...with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri.\"** This is the key part.  \n    * **Encephalomalacia:** This means softening of the brain tissue.  It's a scar, essentially, resulting from the injury and surgery.  Some degree of encephalomalacia is *expected* after any brain surgery, especially one as complex as encephalocele removal.  The size and location are crucial in determining its significance.  \"Small\" is a relatively reassuring term, but we need the neurologist's interpretation.\n    * **Gliosis:** This is a reactive process where glial cells (supportive cells in the brain) proliferate in response to injury. It's another indicator of scarring and healing. Again, some gliosis is expected after surgery.\n\n* **\"Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.\"** This is good news.  The amygdala and hippocampus are crucial for memory and emotion, and their normal appearance suggests the damage is localized.\n\n* **\"No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"** This rules out new tumors or other significant abnormalities in other brain regions.  This is positive.\n\n\n**Your Questions:**\n\n* **Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy?** Yes, some degree is expected.  The extent is what matters.  A \"small\" area is generally considered less concerning than a large area.\n\n* **Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?**  The MRI findings alone don't definitively answer this. The new encephalomalacia/gliosis *could* be the source of the seizure, but it's also possible the seizure was an isolated event unrelated to the scar tissue.  The neurologist will consider several factors:\n    * **Size and location of the encephalomalacia/gliosis:**  A small, localized area is less likely to necessitate surgery.\n    * **History of seizures:** One seizure after two years of being seizure-free is significant, but not automatically indicative of needing another surgery.\n    * **EEG results (if done):** An EEG can help pinpoint if there's ongoing abnormal electrical activity in the brain that could be causing seizures.\n    * **Response to medication:**  The fact that he's already on Vimpat is a good starting point. The dosage might need adjustment or a different medication might be added.\n\n**What to Expect and How to Prepare:**\n\n* **Write down all your questions:**  Don't hesitate to ask the neurologist to clarify anything you don't understand.  Bring a list of your questions and concerns.\n* **Ask about seizure monitoring:** Inquire about options like a home EEG or a longer-term video-EEG in a hospital setting to monitor for further seizures and better localize the source if needed.\n* **Discuss medication options:**  Understand the potential side effects and benefits of different anti-seizure medications.\n* **Prepare for various scenarios:**  Be open to the possibility of medication adjustments, further testing, or even surgical options, but remember the MRI is relatively reassuring and the neurologist will guide you based on a complete evaluation.\n\n**In short:** While the MRI shows some expected scarring and a small area of encephalomalacia/gliosis,  it doesn't automatically mean another surgery is necessary.  The neurologist's assessment considering the full clinical picture is crucial. Try to remain calm and focus on gathering information at your appointment to make informed decisions together.\n"

        "question": "42 F Lamictal, cymbalta, singulair, levothyroxine, Pepcid, ambien 200lbs (significant weight gain in 3 years after injury to cervical spine - unable to run like I used to so I\u2019m confident that is the main reason why) 3-4 drinks per year, past prescription drug use (all prescribed but over used/abused) no addictive medications for almost 2 years besides ambien but now I\u2019m very careful. Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a seizure but it\u2019s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it\u2019s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. Thanks to all the doctors who visit this sub and offer help!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great that you're seeking information and understanding about your experience.  What you're describing sounds like a form of synesthesia, specifically grapheme-color synesthesia (associating letters/numbers with colors) and possibly other types related to tactile and olfactory sensations triggered by visual stimuli.\n\n**Synesthesia is not pseudoscience.**  While the exact mechanisms aren't fully understood, there's considerable scientific research supporting its existence.  Brain imaging studies show distinct neural activity patterns in synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes when experiencing these cross-sensory associations.  It's thought to be related to hyperconnectivity between different brain areas responsible for processing different sensory inputs.  It's not a mental disorder in itself, but it *can* be associated with other conditions, though not necessarily causing a \"downward turn\".\n\n**Could it be related to your epilepsy or medication?**  That's a crucial question, and your neurologist's assessment is important.  The onset after your seizures were controlled is interesting.  While your neurologist dismissed it as a seizure, the timing suggests it warrants further investigation.  Some medications can have unusual side effects, though it's less likely with Lamictal at a stable dosage.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation:**  Given the timing of onset and the unusual nature of your experience, a more detailed neurological evaluation might be beneficial.  This could include additional brain imaging (MRI or EEG) to rule out other potential neurological causes.  Discuss this with your neurologist.\n\n* **Psychiatric Consultation:** While unlikely to be a primary mental disorder itself, a consultation with a psychiatrist could help rule out any underlying psychiatric condition or medication interaction.  They can assess your overall mental health and address any anxieties you have about this experience.\n\n* **Medication Review:** While your medications seem well-managed, a review of your current prescription regimen by your doctor or psychiatrist might be prudent.  It's essential to understand if any medication could contribute to your synesthesia-like symptoms.\n\n* **Differential Diagnosis:** There are other conditions that could potentially mimic synesthesia, though they are less likely given your description. A thorough medical history and examination are vital to making a proper diagnosis.\n\n**In short:**  Your experience is unusual but not necessarily indicative of a worsening mental health condition.  The fact that it's pleasant is reassuring. However, a deeper investigation by your neurologist and potentially a psychiatrist to explore the connection to your epilepsy and medications is warranted for peace of mind and to rule out other possibilities.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask for further tests or specialist referrals if you feel it's necessary.\n"

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're anxious about new findings on your MRI.  Let's break down the \"Brain\" and \"Impression\" sections of your report in a way that hopefully eases your concerns.  **Remember, I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  This explanation is for informational purposes only, and you must discuss these findings with your doctor.**\n\n**Brain:** This section describes the overall appearance of your brain.  Let's look at each part:\n\n* **\"No mass effect or edema:\"** This is excellent news.  \"Mass effect\" refers to a tumor or other lesion pushing on brain tissue and causing swelling (edema). The absence of both means there's no indication of a space-occupying lesion.\n* **\"No significant atrophy or chronic microvascular ischemic changes:\"**  Atrophy means shrinkage of brain tissue.  Chronic microvascular ischemic changes refer to long-term damage from reduced blood flow to small brain vessels.  The report says there's *no significant* amount of either, suggesting your brain's overall structure is relatively healthy.\n* **\"Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right:\"** This is the key finding.  \"Punctate\" means tiny, dot-like.  \"Foci\" means areas.  \"White matter\" refers to the part of the brain responsible for communication between different brain regions.  \"T2/FLAIR\" refers to specific MRI sequences used to highlight certain tissue characteristics.  The \"signal abnormality\" indicates that these tiny areas show up differently on the MRI than normal white matter.  This doesn't automatically mean something serious;  it simply needs further investigation.\n\n**Impression:** This section summarizes the radiologist's interpretation of the findings.\n\n* **\"Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right which may be related to microvascular ischemic change:\"** This reiterates the tiny areas of abnormality in the right white matter and suggests they *might* be due to minor, past problems with blood flow.\n* **\"with demyelinating disease not excluded:\"**  This is the most important part for you to discuss with your neurologist.  \"Demyelinating disease\" refers to conditions where the protective myelin sheath around nerve fibers is damaged (e.g., multiple sclerosis).  The radiologist is saying that while the findings *could* be due to minor, past blood flow problems, they also *could* be related to demyelination.  This doesn't mean you *have* a demyelinating disease, just that it's a possibility.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your neurologist:**  Bring a copy of this MRI report. This is crucial to discuss the findings, especially the possibility of demyelinating disease. They can correlate these findings with your medical history, symptoms (increased migraines, headaches), and neurological exam.\n\n2. **Don't panic:** While the findings warrant further investigation, the report doesn't show anything immediately life-threatening. The absence of mass effect, edema, and significant atrophy is positive.\n\n3. **Be prepared to answer questions:** Your neurologist will likely ask about your symptoms, the frequency and severity of your headaches, and any other neurological concerns you have.\n\n4. **Consider further testing:** Your neurologist might recommend additional tests, such as a follow-up MRI or other neurological assessments, to clarify the nature of the white matter abnormalities.\n\n\nYour age, history of epilepsy, and current medications (especially Lamotrigine and Topiramate which can have side effects including headache) need to be considered by your neurologist when interpreting the MRI.  Don't hesitate to express your anxieties; your doctor is there to help.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  It's extremely important that you **do not** self-medicate, especially given your epilepsy and other conditions.  Liquid Nytol, or any sleep aid, can interact negatively with other medications or pre-existing conditions.  The fact that you have photosensitive epilepsy makes this even riskier.  Some sleep aids can lower the seizure threshold, potentially increasing your risk of a seizure.\n\nYour difficulty sleeping, combined with ADHD, anxiety, and photosensitive epilepsy, needs to be addressed by a medical professional.  A doctor can properly diagnose the underlying causes of your insomnia and recommend safe and effective treatment options that take into account all your health concerns.  They can also assess whether Nytol or any other sleep aid would be appropriate for you.\n\n**I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment with your doctor or a neurologist as soon as possible.**  They can:\n\n* **Assess your sleep problems:**  Determine the underlying cause of your insomnia.\n* **Review your epilepsy:**  Discuss the management of your photosensitive epilepsy and the potential risks of different medications.\n* **Consider your ADHD and anxiety:**  Evaluate how these conditions might be contributing to your sleep issues and recommend appropriate treatments.\n* **Recommend safe sleep aids:** If necessary, they can prescribe a sleep medication that is safe and effective for you, considering your entire health profile.\n\n\nDo not attempt to manage your sleep problems without professional guidance.

FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your description, it's difficult to say definitively whether you need an immediate X-ray or can wait until Monday.  The fact that you experienced immediate numbness after the fall is concerning, as this suggests potential nerve or vascular damage.  The pain at the base of your thumb radiating down the inside of your wrist is also suggestive of a potential problem.  This area contains several important structures, including the carpal tunnel and ligaments.\n\n**Reasons to consider seeking immediate medical attention (ED):**\n\n* **Persistent pain:**  While you describe it as not \"horribly painful,\" the pain is significant enough to disrupt sleep and cause shooting pain with simple movements.  This suggests it might be more serious than initially thought.\n* **Numbness:** Although the initial numbness resolved, any lingering numbness or tingling should be evaluated.  This could indicate nerve compression or damage.\n* **Mechanism of injury:** A fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) is a common mechanism for wrist fractures, especially scaphoid fractures (a bone in the wrist near the base of the thumb). These are notoriously difficult to diagnose on initial X-rays and can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.\n* **Inability to use thumb:**  Difficulty using your thumb significantly impacts daily function.\n\n**Reasons to possibly wait until Monday:**\n\n* **Pain manageable:** The pain is described as not excruciating.\n* **Normal range of motion (mostly):** You haven't described complete loss of range of motion in your wrist.\n\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nWhile an ED visit on a weekend might be inconvenient, the potential for a scaphoid fracture or other significant injury warrants careful consideration.  **I strongly recommend calling the medical centre again or contacting another medical professional (perhaps a nurse advice line) to discuss your symptoms in more detail.** They can better assess the urgency based on your full description and may advise you on whether to wait or proceed to the ED.  A telehealth consultation might also be an option in some areas.\n\nWaiting until Monday carries a risk. If you have a fracture, especially a scaphoid fracture, delaying treatment can lead to delayed healing and potentially more significant long-term problems.  The imaging is crucial to determine if there's a fracture and to guide treatment.\n\nDo not attempt to self-treat or ignore the pain.  Get a professional medical opinion to determine the best course of action.\n"

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

        "answer": "This is a complex situation requiring a discussion with your neurologist.  Your experience strongly suggests a correlation between your Lamictal effectiveness and the age of your medication, despite the manufacturer's stated expiration date.  While Lamictal *generally* remains stable for some time after the expiration date, your case highlights the potential for individual variability.\n\n**Regarding your questions:**\n\n* **Should you throw out the year-old bottles?**  Absolutely discuss this with your neurologist. Your personal experience, the blood level fluctuations, and your neurologist's previous comments all point towards a strong possibility that the older medication is less effective for *you*. Your neurologist is the best person to determine if the potential benefit of using fresh medication outweighs the cost.  The fact that you've experienced a return of morning headaches after a seizure, which previously resolved with the newer medication, further strengthens this argument.  Don't risk your health to save money on medication.\n\n* **XR Formulation Change:** The change from three 200mg XR tablets to two 300mg XR tablets *should not* significantly affect your blood levels, *provided* the extended-release mechanisms are similar.  The total daily dose remains the same (600mg).  However, it's worth mentioning this to your neurologist, as they can confirm the formulation is identical and that any minor differences are unlikely to be clinically significant.\n\n* **Seizure Triggers:** You've correctly identified sleep deprivation and marital stress as potential seizure triggers.  Addressing these underlying issues is crucial for seizure control.  Therapy, stress management techniques, and prioritizing sleep hygiene are vital alongside medication.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nContact your neurologist immediately. Discuss:\n\n* The apparent correlation between Lamictal effectiveness and medication age (even within the expiration date).\n* Your concerns about the expiring medication (August 2022).\n* The recent seizure and return of morning headaches.\n* The change in your Lamictal formulation (200mg vs 300mg XR).\n* The possibility of getting your Lamictal levels checked again.\n\nYour neurologist can assess your situation, perhaps run further tests (blood levels, if feasible), and determine the best course of action.  Don't hesitate to express your concerns; your experience provides valuable information that warrants a thorough investigation.  Your health and safety are paramount.\n"

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",

        "answer": "You're right to be concerned.  The neurologist's explanation is highly improbable.  While maternal stress during labor *can* theoretically contribute to neonatal problems, it's not a plausible explanation for seizures beginning three days postpartum and recurring with increasing severity.  The timing and progression strongly suggest an underlying medical issue.\n\nHere's why the neurologist's explanation is unconvincing and what's more likely:\n\n* **Delayed Onset:** Seizures caused by maternal stress during delivery would be expected to manifest immediately or very shortly after birth, not three days later.  The delay points towards a developing condition in the baby, not a lingering effect of the mother's experience.\n\n* **Escalating Severity:** The seizures increasing in intensity is a critical red flag.  A benign, transient issue wouldn't worsen.\n\n* **Lack of Specific Diagnosis:**  A seasoned neurologist wouldn't dismiss recurrent seizures without a clear, definitive diagnosis.  Even if initial tests were normal, the seizures themselves are a significant finding requiring further investigation.  There are many conditions that can cause neonatal seizures where initial tests appear normal.\n\n* **\"It happens all the time\"**: This statement is alarmingly dismissive. While neonatal seizures are relatively common (though not frequent), experienced neurologists wouldn't casually brush off a case with this frequency and progression.  They would want to rule out serious underlying causes.\n\n**Possible underlying causes (requiring further investigation):**\n\n* **Infections:**  A subtle infection affecting the brain (meningitis, encephalitis) could be the cause.  Many such infections may not show up immediately on standard tests.\n* **Metabolic Disorders:**  Inborn errors of metabolism can cause seizures.\n* **Hypoxia (lack of oxygen) during or after birth:**  While less likely given the initial healthy assessment, subtle hypoxia can sometimes manifest later.\n* **Structural Brain Abnormalities:**  While the initial brain scan was normal,  more specialized imaging might reveal subtle issues.\n* **Epilepsy:** This is a possibility, though the cause of epilepsy itself would need to be determined.\n\n\n**What your friend should do:**\n\n* **Seek a second opinion:**  Absolutely crucial. They need an opinion from another experienced neonatologist or pediatric neurologist, ideally at a children's hospital with a specialized neonatal unit.\n* **Detailed History:**  They need to provide the new doctor with a complete and detailed history of the pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the baby's symptoms.  The timing of each seizure is vital.\n* **Advocate for further testing:**  If the initial tests were inconclusive, they should insist on further investigation, including possibly more detailed brain imaging (MRI), metabolic testing, and potentially a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to rule out infection.\n* **Documentation:**  Keep meticulous records of every appointment, test result, and the baby's symptoms.\n\n\nIt's understandable that your friend and family are clinging to the neurologist's reassuring words, but the baby's condition requires much more thorough investigation.  The symptoms are too concerning to ignore.  Encouraging them to seek a second opinion is the best way to ensure their baby receives the appropriate care and diagnosis.  Your concern is justified, and it's important they don't hesitate to push for more answers.\n"

        "question": "So I'm an 18 yr old Caucasian male (62kg,180cm). Since some months ago, I have constant depersonalization/dereaalization and periods of confusion that really bother me. I went to a neurologist and had an MRI scan(which turned out fine, except for some normal anatomical variants) and I was wondering if my confusion and dpdr can be the result of epilepsy ?(non-convulsive seizures). Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to say whether your depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) and confusion are caused by non-convulsive seizures.  While these symptoms *can* be associated with epilepsy, a normal MRI scan significantly reduces the likelihood.  However, an MRI doesn't detect all types of seizures or underlying neurological issues.\n\nThe fact that your MRI showed only normal anatomical variants is reassuring, but it doesn't rule out epilepsy entirely.  Some types of epilepsy don't show up on an MRI.\n\n**Here's why you need to follow up with a medical professional:**\n\n* **Differential Diagnosis:**  DPDR and confusion have many potential causes, including:\n    * **Anxiety disorders:**  This is a very common cause of DPDR.\n    * **Depression:**  Often co-occurs with DPDR and can cause cognitive difficulties.\n    * **Trauma:**  Past trauma can trigger DPDR.\n    * **Substance use:**  Drugs and alcohol can exacerbate or cause these symptoms.\n    * **Sleep deprivation:**  Lack of sleep can significantly impact cognitive function.\n    * **Other neurological conditions:**  While less likely given your MRI, other conditions should be considered.\n\n* **Neurology Expertise:** Your neurologist is the best person to interpret your MRI findings in the context of your symptoms.  They may consider further investigations, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor brainwave activity.  An EEG is often used to detect seizure activity, especially non-convulsive seizures, which are difficult to identify with other tests.\n\n* **Psychiatric Evaluation:** It's crucial to also consider a psychiatric evaluation. A psychiatrist can assess for anxiety disorders, depression, or other mental health conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n**In short:** Don't rely on online information to diagnose yourself.  Your symptoms warrant further investigation by your medical team.  Schedule a follow-up with your neurologist and discuss your concerns about epilepsy and the possibility of a psychiatric evaluation.  They can determine the best course of action based on a comprehensive assessment of your medical history and current symptoms.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This 31-year-old female presents with a complex and concerning constellation of symptoms.  The combination of seizures, fluctuating GFR, anemia, low potassium, positive ANA, and new neurological deficits (stroke-like symptoms, including aphasia, dysphagia, and drop foot) points towards a serious underlying condition, likely an autoimmune disorder with multi-system involvement.  While the differential diagnosis was considered MS and lupus, the presented data suggest other possibilities need strong consideration.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the initial differentials might be insufficient and alternative possibilities:\n\n**Why MS and Lupus are less likely (given the information):**\n\n* **MS:** While MS can cause neurological symptoms, the presence of the other systemic issues (anemia, low potassium, fluctuating GFR, positive ANA, clotting issues) makes a primary MS diagnosis less likely.  MRI clearance is a good point, but MS can be challenging to diagnose definitively, especially early on.\n* **Lupus:**  Stable C3 and C4 are often cited as arguments *against* lupus, but this isn't definitive. Lupus can present atypically, and these complement levels can fluctuate.  The significant rise in ANA titer and the multi-system involvement (neurological, hematological, renal) should raise suspicion of a systemic autoimmune disease even with initially normal C3/C4.\n\n\n**More Likely Possibilities (requiring further investigation):**\n\n1. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):**  This is a strong contender given the history of significant postpartum hemorrhage, small blood clots, bruising, and Raynaud's phenomenon.  APS can cause recurrent miscarriages, thrombocytopenia, and neurological symptoms.  The fluctuating GFR could be related to renal involvement from APS.  Specific testing for antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibodies) is crucial.\n\n2. **Systemic Vasculitis:**  The combination of neurological deficits, Raynaud's, skin changes (bruising), and fluctuating GFR points towards the possibility of a vasculitis.  Different types of vasculitis affect different organ systems, and the symptoms overlap with APS.  Further investigation would involve a thorough autoimmune workup, including ANCA testing and potentially a biopsy (e.g., renal biopsy if renal involvement is significant).\n\n3. **Rare Autoimmune Disorders:**  There are many rare autoimmune diseases that can present with overlapping symptoms.  These might require consultation with a rheumatologist specializing in rare autoimmune conditions.  Conditions to consider include but are not limited to:  Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD),  Scleroderma (which can present with Raynaud\u2019s, renal involvement, and skin changes).\n\n\n**Important Investigations:**\n\n* **Repeat and expanded autoimmune workup:** including a complete panel of antiphospholipid antibodies, ANCA panel, and potentially specific tests for other rare autoimmune diseases.  A repeat lupus workup with more specific antibody testing is also necessary.\n* **Renal biopsy:** If renal function continues to fluctuate, a renal biopsy is crucial to determine the cause of the GFR swings.\n* **Neurological consultation:**  A detailed neurological examination and possibly further neuroimaging (depending on the initial MRI findings) would be beneficial.\n* **Hematology consultation:**  To fully investigate the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and low potassium.\n* **Detailed genetic testing:** Given the family history of epilepsy, genetic testing might help identify predispositions to certain conditions.\n\n**Urgent Considerations:**\n\nThe patient's recent neurological deficits (stroke-like symptoms) require urgent attention.  Given the potential for APS or vasculitis, prompt assessment and treatment are crucial to prevent further damage.\n\n\n**In summary:** This patient requires a thorough and multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, rheumatology, and hematology.  The initial differentials are insufficient, and a strong suspicion for an autoimmune disease, particularly APS or a systemic vasculitis, needs to be investigated urgently.  Further testing is imperative for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.\n"

        "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",

        "answer": "It's understandable you're concerned about your mother's increased seizure frequency and the impact it's having on her life.  The situation is complex, and it's crucial to work closely with her medical team.  There's no simple answer to why her medication isn't controlling the absent seizures as effectively as before, but several factors could be contributing:\n\n**Possible Reasons for Increased Seizure Frequency:**\n\n* **Medication Changes:** Even subtle changes in medication absorption (due to things like different food in India, changes in gut flora, or other medications) can affect efficacy.  The increased frequency might indicate the current dosage isn't sufficient, or the current combination isn't optimal.  It's essential to discuss this with her neurologist.  They may consider:\n    * **Dose adjustment:** Increasing the dosage of Keppra or Trileptal, or both.\n    * **Medication switch:** Trying a different anti-epileptic drug (AED) altogether.\n    * **Adding a medication:**  Sometimes, adding another AED can improve control.\n    * **Blood levels:** Getting blood tests to check the actual levels of the AEDs in her system to ensure they're within the therapeutic range.\n\n* **Stress and Anxiety:** As you mentioned, stress and anxiety are significant triggers. The six-month trip to India, coupled with potential adjustment difficulties upon return and feeling isolated, likely played a major role. This underscores the importance of psychological support.\n\n* **Underlying Medical Conditions:**  New or worsening health issues (even unrelated to epilepsy) can affect seizure control.  A thorough review of her overall health by her doctor is essential.\n\n* **Other Factors:**  Things like sleep deprivation, missed doses of medication, diet, and even hormonal fluctuations can influence seizure activity.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n1. **Neurology Appointment:** Schedule an appointment with her neurologist *immediately*.  Clearly explain the increased frequency and severity of absent seizures, the triggering factors (stress, anxiety), and the impact on her quality of life.  Advocate for blood tests to check AED levels.\n\n2. **Psychological Support:** The psychologist appointment is crucial.  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other therapeutic approaches can help her manage stress and anxiety, which are significant seizure triggers.\n\n3. **Safety Measures:**  Given the risk of injury during absent seizures, implement safety precautions:\n    * **Remove hazards:**  Clear clutter from her living space, ensure floors are clear of obstacles, and secure sharp objects.\n    * **Protective headwear:** Consider a helmet or padded hat, especially during activities where falls are more likely.\n    * **Med-alert bracelet:**  This is essential to ensure she gets appropriate help if a seizure occurs in public.\n    * **Supervision:**  If possible, have someone with her during high-risk periods.\n\n\n4. **Lifestyle Changes:** Work with her on lifestyle modifications:\n    * **Stress reduction techniques:** Encourage relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or spending time in nature.\n    * **Regular sleep schedule:**  Consistent sleep is crucial for seizure control.\n    * **Healthy diet:**  Maintain a balanced diet and avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol (though she doesn't drink).\n    * **Regular exercise:**  Physical activity can help manage stress and improve overall health.\n\n5. **Consider a Specialist EEG:** Discuss with her neurologist about the possibility of doing a longer-term EEG monitoring to better identify seizure patterns and any potential triggers.\n\n6. **Support Network:**  Encourage connection with friends, family (even virtually) and support groups.  This will help combat the isolation she feels.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only. The advice provided is general and should not replace the professional guidance of her doctors.  Prompt and thorough follow-up with her medical team is vital to manage her epilepsy effectively.\n"

        "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing.

        "answer": "It's fascinating that you've had these intense acid cravings since childhood! While it's unusual, it doesn't automatically indicate a serious underlying medical problem, especially since you're otherwise healthy and at a normal weight.  However, let's explore some possibilities.\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n* **Nutrient Deficiency (Unlikely but possible):** While cravings are sometimes associated with deficiencies, it's less likely in your case given your varied diet and normal weight.  The intense craving for *acid itself*, rather than specific foods rich in particular vitamins or minerals, makes a simple nutrient deficiency less probable.  It's more likely that the acidity is providing a sensory satisfaction rather than fulfilling a physiological need.\n\n* **Sensory-Seeking Behavior:**  Some individuals have a higher need for intense sensory experiences.  The sharp, pungent taste and burn of vinegar might be providing this stimulation. This is a possibility given that this has persisted since childhood.\n\n* **Underlying Medical Condition (Less Likely):** While your low white blood cell count is noted, it's unlikely to be directly linked to your vinegar cravings.  It's crucial to discuss this with your doctor to ensure it's being appropriately monitored and to rule out any related issues.  The other conditions you've mentioned (migraines, IST, valve regurgitation) also don't have an obvious connection to acid cravings.\n\n* **Habit and Learned Behavior:** The cravings could simply be a strong, ingrained habit or learned behavior developed from childhood.  The satisfaction you derive from the taste might be reinforcing the behavior.\n\n* **Gastrointestinal Issues (Possible):**  While not directly causing the cravings, a subtle underlying gastrointestinal issue could be influencing your preferences.  The acidity might be providing temporary relief, albeit an unusual one, from discomfort.  This is worth discussing with your doctor or a gastroenterologist if the cravings are particularly bothersome.\n\n* **Psychological Factors:**  Sometimes intense cravings can be connected to stress, anxiety, or other emotional factors.  While you haven't mentioned stress as a trigger, it's worth considering if these cravings are amplified during periods of heightened stress.\n\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1. **Discuss with your doctor:**  Mention the cravings to your physician during your next appointment.  They can consider your complete medical history, review your blood work (especially the low white blood cell count), and assess if any further testing is necessary.  This is particularly important given the persistence and intensity of your cravings.\n\n2. **Keep a food diary:** Tracking when your cravings occur, what triggers them (if anything), and how you feel before, during, and after could help identify potential patterns.\n\n3. **Consider a gastroenterology consult:** If your doctor agrees, a gastroenterologist might be able to investigate if there's any underlying GI issue contributing to the cravings.\n\nIn summary, while a simple nutrient deficiency is less likely, it's important to rule out other potential medical reasons through discussions with your healthcare providers. The other possibilities, such as sensory-seeking behavior or learned habit, are also plausible explanations for your unique cravings.\n"

        "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a very concerning situation, and it's understandable that you and your relative are feeling lost and frustrated.  The lack of a clear diagnosis after extensive testing is particularly difficult.  The cyclical fainting around her period, combined with the brief episodes of automatism (the autopilot moments), suggests a complex problem that may not be solely epilepsy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is challenging and what steps you should consider taking:\n\n**Why it's challenging:**\n\n* **Non-specific symptoms:** Fainting, loss of consciousness, and automatism are symptoms that can stem from a wide variety of neurological and non-neurological conditions.\n* **Inconsistent seizure activity:** The diagnosis of epilepsy was based on a *single* shaking seizure.  The other episodes described sound more like syncope (fainting) than typical epileptic seizures.  While epilepsy can cause both, the presentation is unusual.\n* **Inconclusive MS testing:** The corticosteroid trial for MS was short. While it's common to withdraw steroids if there's no clear response,  a single trial doesn't definitively rule out MS.  Other tests might be needed to investigate this further.\n* **Menstrual cycle connection:** The link to her menstrual cycle strongly suggests a hormonal influence.  This could point to several possibilities, including hormonal imbalances, dysautonomia (problems with the autonomic nervous system regulating blood pressure and heart rate), or even a rare form of epilepsy exacerbated by hormones.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Seek a second (or third) opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy AND syncope:**  Explain the complete history, including the menstrual cycle correlation and the episodes of automatism. Emphasize the impact on her life.  A specialist with expertise in both areas might offer a more focused diagnostic approach.\n\n2. **Comprehensive neurological workup:**  While MRIs were done, other tests might be helpful:\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  A longer EEG, potentially including a sleep-deprived EEG, is crucial to detect subtle electrical abnormalities in the brain that might not be apparent during a typical short EEG.  This is particularly important given the episodic nature of the symptoms.\n    * **Tilt-table test:** This assesses whether changes in blood pressure cause fainting (vasovagal syncope).\n    * **Cardiac workup:** Rule out any heart conditions that could lead to fainting (arrhythmias, structural abnormalities). An echocardiogram and ECG are important.\n    * **Hormonal testing:** Blood tests to assess hormone levels, particularly around her menstrual cycle, might reveal imbalances.\n    * **Autonomic nervous system testing:**  This could help diagnose dysautonomia.\n\n3. **Detailed diary:** Have your relative keep a very detailed diary tracking:\n    * Date and time of each episode.\n    * Description of the episode (e.g., sudden loss of consciousness, duration, any warning signs, any triggers).\n    * Menstrual cycle timing (day of cycle).\n    * Medications taken.\n    * Any other relevant information (stress, sleep, diet).\n\n\n4. **Safety precautions:** Until a diagnosis and treatment are established, safety is paramount:\n    * Avoid activities that could cause injury if she falls (e.g., driving, climbing ladders).\n    * Consider a medical alert bracelet or necklace.\n    * Have someone with her at all times, particularly when she's feeling unwell.\n\n\n5. **Consider other specialists:** Depending on the findings, a consultation with an endocrinologist (hormone specialist) or a cardiologist might be beneficial.\n\n\nThis situation requires a thorough and multidisciplinary approach.  Don't give up seeking answers.  The persistence of symptoms and the impact on her life warrant a dedicated effort to find a diagnosis and effective treatment.  Keep detailed records and advocate strongly for your relative to receive the necessary investigations.\n"

Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's important to address your concerns with your doctor as soon as possible.  While Keppra (levetiracetam) is generally well-tolerated,  the symptoms you describe \u2013 excessive fatigue despite sufficient sleep, dizziness/lightheadedness with a sensation of \"dropping\" or \"melting,\" and the feeling of your brain \"tripping up\" \u2013  warrant a medical evaluation.\n\nSeveral possibilities exist, and only a doctor can determine the cause:\n\n* **Keppra side effects:** While rare, prolonged use of Keppra can lead to increased fatigue or other neurological side effects.  The \"dropping\" or \"melting\" sensation might indicate a subtle neurological issue that needs investigation.  It's unlikely the medication would simply \"wear off\" in terms of its anti-seizure effect, but its effectiveness and side-effect profile can change over time.\n\n* **Other medical conditions:** Your symptoms could be indicative of other underlying health problems, such as anemia, sleep apnea, thyroid issues, or even something less common.\n\n* **Medication interactions:** Are you taking any other medications that could interact with Keppra and contribute to your symptoms?\n\n* **Sleep disorders:** The extreme fatigue and difficulty waking up suggest a potential sleep disorder that is separate from your epilepsy.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat.**  The \"shaking it off\" approach is not advisable.  These symptoms deserve professional attention.  Schedule an appointment with your neurologist or primary care physician to discuss your concerns. They can perform a thorough examination, review your medical history, and possibly order tests to determine the cause of your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.  This might include blood tests, an EEG (electroencephalogram), or other investigations.\n"

        "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female 5,5 Ft, 160 Lbs Non smoker",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a concerning situation, and it's understandable you're feeling lost and frustrated.  The fact that your relative is experiencing these episodes, especially with the potential link to her menstrual cycle and the recent \"autopilot\" incident, warrants further investigation.  The inconclusive MS diagnosis adds to the complexity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what needs to be considered and potential next steps:\n\n**1.  Clarify the Diagnosis and Events:**\n\n* **Seizure vs. Syncope (Fainting):**  The distinction is crucial.  Epileptic seizures typically involve convulsions and loss of consciousness, while syncope is a sudden loss of consciousness due to insufficient blood flow to the brain.  The \"shaking seizure\" diagnosis needs careful review.  Was it witnessed by a medical professional?  What was the exact description of the event?  Was an EEG performed?  A detailed description of the events, including any aura (warning signs before the event), the duration of unconsciousness, and any post-ictal symptoms (symptoms after the event, like confusion or weakness) is vital.\n* **\"Fainting\" Description:**  The description of \"fainting\" needs more detail.  Does she collapse completely?  Does she experience any warning signs like dizziness, nausea, or visual changes beforehand?  How long does the episode last?  Does she have any injuries after falling?  The two-week frequency linked to her period is important to note.\n* **\"Autopilot\" Episodes:** This new symptom is significant.  It suggests a possible problem with brain function, potentially different from epilepsy or MS.  It could be a form of absence seizure, a different type of seizure, or something else entirely.\n\n**2.  Further Investigations:**\n\n* **Comprehensive Neurological Exam:**  A thorough re-evaluation by a neurologist is essential. This should include a detailed history of all symptoms, a neurological exam focusing on cognitive function, and discussion of the \"autopilot\" episodes.\n* **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  This test records brain electrical activity and can help detect abnormal patterns associated with seizures.  It should be done during both waking and sleeping hours, ideally during a time when episodes are likely to occur.  A longer-term EEG (e.g., 24-hour or even longer) might be necessary if spontaneous events are infrequent.\n* **Tilt Table Test:**  This test can help determine if the fainting episodes are caused by a problem with the autonomic nervous system (which regulates blood pressure and heart rate). This is particularly relevant if the episodes are linked to her menstrual cycle (hormonal fluctuations can affect the autonomic nervous system).\n* **Cardiac Workup:**  To rule out any underlying heart conditions that could contribute to syncope.  This might include an electrocardiogram (ECG) and possibly further cardiac testing.\n* **Repeat MRI (with contrast):**  Consider repeating the MRI, especially if there's a suspicion of MS. Different MRI sequences or a more detailed review by a neuroradiologist specializing in MS might be helpful.\n* **Other blood tests:** This might help find other problems that could be causing these events.\n\n\n**3.  Focusing on the Menstrual Cycle:**\n\nThe link to the menstrual cycle strongly suggests a hormonal influence.  The neurologist should consider this in the differential diagnosis.  Tracking the episodes meticulously in a diary, noting the timing relative to her menstrual cycle, will be very helpful.\n\n**4.  Safety:**\n\nYour relative's safety is paramount.  She needs to avoid activities that could cause injury if she loses consciousness (driving, operating machinery, climbing ladders, etc.).  Consider wearing a helmet to minimize head injuries during falls.\n\n**5. Seeking a Second (or Third) Opinion:**\n\nGiven the inconclusive diagnoses and the severity of the symptoms, seeking opinions from other specialists, perhaps at a larger medical center with a neurology department specializing in epilepsy and syncope, is highly recommended.\n\n\n**In summary:**  This is a complex case requiring a multi-disciplinary approach.  The emphasis should be on meticulous documentation of the events, comprehensive neurological testing, and collaboration between neurologists, possibly cardiologists, and other specialists to reach a definitive diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan.  Don't hesitate to advocate strongly for your relative to get the thorough investigations she needs.  Keeping detailed records of all events and test results will be invaluable for future consultations.\n"

        "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're anxious about coming off Keppra, especially given your recent experience and the responsibility of caring for a newborn.  Your concerns are valid and deserve a thorough discussion with your neurologist.  The nonchalant response you've received is unacceptable, and you deserve a more attentive and reassuring conversation.\n\nHere's what we know and what you should address with your neurologist (and if necessary, seek a second opinion):\n\n**What we know:**\n\n* **Postpartum Eclampsia:** Your seizures were directly linked to the high blood pressure caused by eclampsia. This is a crucial point.  Eclampsia-related seizures are generally not a sign of ongoing epilepsy.\n* **Keppra's Purpose:** The Keppra was preventative, to reduce the risk of further seizures while your blood pressure was unstable and recovering.\n* **Blood Pressure Control:** Your blood pressure is now stable. This significantly reduces the risk of another eclampsia-related seizure.\n* **Withdrawal Symptoms:**  Keppra withdrawal *can* cause symptoms, ranging from mild (headache, nausea) to more severe (seizures, though less common).  The duration of your treatment (a month) is relatively short, which might lessen the severity of withdrawal.  However, *everyone* reacts differently.\n\n**What you MUST discuss with your neurologist (or a new neurologist):**\n\n1. **Gradual Tapering:**  Insist on a *gradual* tapering off the Keppra, not sudden cessation.  This is standard practice to minimize withdrawal symptoms.  Your neurologist should provide a specific tapering schedule.\n\n2. **Withdrawal Symptoms & Mitigation:**  Specifically ask about potential withdrawal symptoms and what to expect.  Ask about strategies to manage these symptoms if they occur (e.g., over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches).\n\n3. **Seizure Risk:**  Reiterate your concerns about the risk of a seizure during withdrawal, especially given your circumstances.  Ask for a clear assessment of this risk, given your history and current stable blood pressure.  Ask if there's a way to monitor for any seizure activity during the weaning process.\n\n4. **Support System:**  Discuss your limited support system and the need to be fully functional for your newborn.  Your neurologist needs to understand the urgency of your situation.\n\n5. **Second Opinion:** If you're not getting satisfactory answers or feel your concerns are dismissed, actively seek a second opinion from another neurologist.  This is crucial for your peace of mind and safety.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of your conversations with your neurologist, including dates, times, and the content of the discussion.\n* **Advocacy:** Don't hesitate to be assertive in advocating for your needs and concerns.  Your health and the safety of your baby are paramount.\n* **Emergency Plan:**  Develop an emergency plan in case you experience any concerning symptoms during withdrawal.  This should include knowing who to contact and having a plan for your baby's care.\n\n\nIn short, don't rely solely on what you've read online.  Have a detailed, in-depth conversation with your doctor (or a new one) to create a safe and effective plan for discontinuing Keppra. Your safety and the safety of your baby should be the top priority.  Don't hesitate to seek help if you feel you aren't receiving adequate care.\n"

        "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're anxious given your experience and the complex medical situation.  Let's address your questions point by point:\n\n**Are these seizures, or could this issue be completely vascular in nature?**\n\nIt's possible your symptoms have both vascular and seizure components.  The initial event *could* have been caused by a carotid artery dissection leading to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a small stroke. The electric shock sensations (paresthesia) in your hand and head are suggestive of neurological dysfunction, which could be caused by either a vascular event or seizure activity.  The convulsive episode and loss of consciousness strongly point towards a seizure.  However, a TIA *can* trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.\n\nYour \"pit in the stomach\" feeling is a subjective experience. While it might be an aura preceding a seizure, it could also be anxiety related to your health concerns.  This needs careful evaluation.\n\n**Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures?**\n\nYes, a carotid artery dissection or TIA can trigger seizures.  The disruption of blood flow to the brain caused by these events can lead to abnormal electrical activity and seizures.  This is especially true if the event caused a small stroke or damage to brain tissue.\n\n**What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner.**\n\nYour initial attack's presentation is not typical for a simple TIA.  The combination of focal neurological symptoms (paresthesia), loss of consciousness, and convulsions strongly suggests a more complex event involving both vascular compromise and seizure activity.  The fact that you had a convulsive episode is quite important here.\n\n**Will I be on these seizure meds forever?**\n\nWhether you'll be on anti-seizure medication long-term depends on several factors:\n\n* **Diagnosis:** A definitive diagnosis is crucial.  The upcoming angiogram is a critical step.  The neurologist and neurosurgeon need to determine if the vascular issue is fully resolved and whether there's ongoing risk of further events.  Neuroimaging, including the functional MRI, will also help.\n* **Seizure recurrence:**  If you have further seizures, the likelihood of long-term medication increases significantly.  If the seizures are solely related to the vascular event and that event is treated successfully, the need for long-term meds might be reduced or eliminated.\n* **Medication response and side effects:**  The fact that you experience significant side effects from Keppra is important.  Your neurologist should work with you to find the most effective and tolerable medication.  There are many options.\n\n**Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?**\n\nA diagnosis of epilepsy is made after two or more unprovoked seizures.  Given your initial event, it's premature to label you with epilepsy.  The ongoing evaluation will be key in determining whether your episode was an isolated event related to the vascular issue or the beginning of epilepsy.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Cooperate fully with your medical team:**  The angiogram is key.  Be open and honest about your symptoms and concerns.\n* **Keep a detailed seizure diary:**  If you experience further episodes, note the time, duration, symptoms, and anything you were doing beforehand.  This is extremely valuable for your doctors.\n* **Discuss your medication side effects:**  Openly communicate the challenges you're having with Vimpat.  There are alternatives.\n* **Manage your risk factors:**  Your obesity, diabetes, and hypertension significantly increase your risk of stroke and vascular events.  Aggressive management of these conditions is critical to your health.\n\n\nIn summary, your situation requires careful consideration of both vascular and seizure disorders.  The upcoming angiogram and ongoing neurological monitoring are essential to determine the precise cause of your initial episode and the nature of your subsequent symptoms.  Don't hesitate to ask your doctors to clarify anything you don't understand.  This is a complex medical case requiring close collaboration between neurologists and neurosurgeons.\n"

        "question": "Why does my head feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking when I put my hands on my forehead and press them down into my pillow ? I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5\u20199 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I\u2019m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don\u2019t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress. They booked me in with a neurologist but it might take 3 week. What\u2019s wrong with me ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand you're concerned about the new twitching, shaking sensations, and the feeling of your head shaking when pressed against a pillow.  It's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot diagnose medical conditions.  The information below is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.\n\n**What you've described could be several things, and it's crucial to follow up with your neurologist appointment:**\n\n* **Benign fasciculations:**  As the doctor suggested, these are muscle twitches caused by the involuntary contraction of muscle fibers. Stress is a common trigger.  They are usually harmless but can be unsettling.\n\n* **Medication side effects:** Epilim (valproate) can have side effects, including tremor or other movement disorders. While you've been on it for a while, changes in dosage, or even individual sensitivity, can lead to new side effects.  It's vital to discuss any new symptoms with your prescribing doctor or neurologist.\n\n* **Anxiety:**  The stress itself could be exacerbating the twitches and creating sensations like the head shaking.  Anxiety can manifest physically in various ways.\n\n* **Other neurological causes (less likely, given your history):**  While your Polish neurologist indicated a high likelihood of only absence seizures, the new symptoms warrant further investigation.  This is why the upcoming neurologist appointment is important.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Keep a detailed diary:** Note the timing, location, and severity of the twitches and shaking sensations.  This will be helpful for your neurologist.  Include details about your stress levels as well.\n* **Don't self-diagnose:** Avoid searching online for potential diagnoses, as this can lead to unnecessary anxiety.\n* **Attend your neurologist appointment:**  This is the most crucial step.  They can perform a thorough examination and determine the cause of your symptoms.  Be prepared to discuss all your symptoms, your medication, and your stress levels.\n* **Follow your doctors' advice:**  If they recommend any tests or changes to your medication, follow their instructions carefully.\n* **Consider stress management techniques:** If stress is a contributing factor, explore techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or exercise to help manage it.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The feeling of your head shaking when pressed against the pillow could be a sensory misinterpretation rather than actual shaking.  The pressure might be activating certain nerves or creating a sensation that feels like movement.  However, your neurologist will be able to assess this.  Do not delay your neurology appointment;  consistent monitoring and professional advice are key in managing neurological conditions.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're scared after experiencing such a frightening event.  What you describe sounds like a possible syncopal episode (fainting), potentially triggered by a combination of factors.  Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  Moving from a warm pool into a cooler environment can cause your blood vessels to constrict, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure. This is especially true if you were dehydrated from being in the sun.  Weed can also exacerbate this effect by lowering blood pressure.\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a common type of fainting triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure.  The heat, dehydration, and the marijuana could have all contributed to this.  The feeling of lightheadedness before the fall is a classic symptom.\n\n* **Panic Attack/Anxiety:**  While you felt physical symptoms, the intense fear and feeling of loss of control could have been amplified by a panic attack, particularly given your existing psychological conditions.  The combination of marijuana and the initial lightheadedness could have triggered this.\n\n* **Marijuana Interaction:** While rare, some individuals are more sensitive to marijuana's effects than others. The amount you smoked, your tolerance, and the specific strain could have interacted to produce an unusual reaction.  This is less likely given your frequency of use but not impossible.\n\n* **Underlying Medical Condition (Less Likely):**  While less probable given your lack of prior incidents, it's worth mentioning that some underlying heart conditions or neurological issues *could* cause such an episode. However, the absence of any prior symptoms and the single occurrence makes this less likely.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **See a Doctor:** This is crucial.  While many of the above explanations are benign, a doctor can rule out any underlying medical issues.  Explain *everything* that happened, including your marijuana use (it's important for a complete assessment, even though it's illegal in many places). Be upfront and honest.\n\n2. **Mention your psychological conditions:**  The doctor should be aware of your pre-existing psychological conditions as these can impact the likelihood of anxiety or panic attack being a contributing factor.\n\n3. **Hydration and Diet:**  Pay close attention to hydration, especially in warm weather.  Ensure you're eating a balanced diet. Dehydration and low blood sugar can contribute to fainting.\n\n4. **Reduce Marijuana Use (or cease entirely):**  Given this experience, it might be prudent to significantly reduce or completely avoid marijuana until you've seen a doctor and received a clear diagnosis.\n\n5. **Avoid Triggers:**  Be mindful of situations that might trigger similar episodes in the future, like being in hot environments and subsequent sudden changes in temperature or position.\n\n**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  A proper medical evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause of your episode and receive appropriate recommendations.  Don't delay seeking professional medical help.  Your safety and well-being are paramount.\n"

        "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The scenario you describe is concerning and points towards a serious neurological event, likely a stroke, but with atypical features that warrant consideration of other possibilities.  Let's break down why a stroke is a strong possibility, yet other conditions should be considered:\n\n**Why Stroke is Likely:**\n\n* **Sudden onset of neurological symptoms:** The sudden freezing, facial asymmetry (the smile on only one side), and loss of consciousness all strongly suggest a cerebrovascular event, like a stroke.  The asymmetrical smile (affecting only one side of the face) is a classic sign of a stroke impacting the facial nerve.\n* **Loss of consciousness:** This is a major indicator of a significant neurological problem.\n* **Post-ictal state:** The period of unconsciousness (5-7 minutes) followed by disorientation is consistent with a post-ictal state \u2013 the period after a seizure. While not all strokes involve seizures, they can certainly trigger them.\n* **Bleeding from the ear:** This is a serious sign and could be due to a skull fracture (as the medics suggested) or a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.\n* **Facial asymmetry:** The \"smile\" only on one side of his face strongly indicates neurological damage affecting the facial nerve's control, highly suggestive of a stroke.\n\n**Why Other Conditions Should Be Considered:**\n\n* **The Laughter:** The unnatural laughter is atypical for a typical stroke.  This could be related to the location of the stroke in the brain.  Some strokes affecting specific areas can cause strange, involuntary behaviours like laughter or crying (pseudobulbar affect).\n* **Epilepsy:** Though he denied having epilepsy, the sudden onset, loss of consciousness, and post-ictal state could be consistent with a seizure, especially a complex partial seizure.  The fact he denied it doesn't rule it out; he may have been disoriented and unable to recall.  A detailed neurological evaluation will be crucial.\n* **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are rare conditions that can mimic stroke symptoms, but are less likely given the overall presentation.\n\n**What's crucial:**\n\nThe key is the information gathered from his medical tests.  A CT scan or MRI of the brain is essential to determine the precise cause.  These scans will show if there's bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke), a blockage in a blood vessel (ischemic stroke), or other structural abnormalities.  An EEG might also be done to look for seizure activity.\n\n**In short:**  While a stroke is the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided, the atypical laughter warrants investigation into other possibilities, including epilepsy.  The definitive diagnosis will only come from the medical tests and examinations he will hopefully be undergoing.  I strongly urge you to follow up on his condition if you can.\n"

        "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated.  While it's your responsibility to schedule appointments, a neurologist's refusal to renew a life-sustaining medication like lamotrigine without a prior in-person appointment, especially with such short renewal periods, is unusual and potentially problematic.  It's *not* the norm for epilepsy medication.\n\nHere's why his actions raise concerns:\n\n* **Risk of seizure:**  The most significant concern is the risk of seizures if you run out of medication.  This is a serious health issue.\n* **Limited access to care:**  Not everyone has the flexibility or resources to schedule appointments on short notice.  His policy could disproportionately impact patients with limited transportation, work constraints, or other challenges.\n* **Medication management:** While regular check-ups are important to monitor effectiveness and side effects,  the six-month renewal policy is overly restrictive for a stable patient on lamotrigine. Most neurologists will allow for longer renewals (sometimes 1 year or more) once a patient shows stability.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Tomorrow's Appointment:** Attend your appointment tomorrow.  Clearly and calmly explain your concerns about the short renewal periods and the potential risk of running out of medication.  Ask him to explain his reasoning.  Request a longer refill period for future prescriptions (e.g., at least a year) *provided* your condition remains stable and you continue to have good seizure control.\n\n2. **Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of your appointments, including dates, discussion points, and any prescriptions.\n\n3. **Consider a Second Opinion:**  If you're not satisfied with your neurologist's response or if this happens again, consider seeking a second opinion from a different neurologist.  A different doctor may have a more flexible approach to prescribing medication.\n\n4. **Advocate for Yourself:** You have a right to access necessary medication.  Don't hesitate to advocate for your needs.\n\n\nIt's *not* necessarily about blaming your doctor; it's about ensuring you have access to the medication you need to stay healthy. Your health is paramount.  While you bear responsibility for scheduling appointments, a neurologist should have a more patient-centered approach regarding life-saving medications.  His actions could be considered negligent if you experienced a seizure due to lack of access to your medication.  Keep documentation of everything in case this becomes a larger issue.\n"

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand you're in a very difficult and worrying situation.  It's incredibly stressful to receive a diagnosis of epilepsy, especially when it's accompanied by memory problems and the fear of dementia.  It's also frustrating to have felt dismissed by previous doctors.\n\n**It's crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.**  My information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for the advice of your neurologist or other qualified medical professionals.\n\nHere's what I can offer based on your description:\n\n* **Carbamazepine (Zeptol):** This medication takes time to build up to effective levels in your system.  Two weeks is a relatively short period to assess its impact, especially on cognitive function.  The improvement may be gradual, not immediate.  **Do not adjust your dosage without consulting your neurologist.**  They will monitor your progress and adjust the medication as needed.  They may also consider adding or changing other medications to better address your symptoms.\n\n* **Memory and Cognitive Function:**  The connection between epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy (which affects the hippocampus), and memory problems is well-established.  The hippocampus plays a vital role in memory consolidation.  While some memory impairment related to epilepsy *can* be reversible with treatment and seizure control, the extent of reversibility depends on several factors including the severity and duration of the epilepsy, the location of the seizures in the brain, and the individual's response to treatment.\n\n* **Dementia and Alzheimer's:**  It's very concerning that you feel you have dementia.  A formal diagnosis of dementia requires a thorough neurological and cognitive assessment by a specialist. Your neurologist is the best person to assess this.   While epilepsy can contribute to cognitive decline, it does not automatically mean you will develop Alzheimer's disease in your 30s.  Many factors contribute to the development of Alzheimer's, and it's far too early to make such a prediction.\n\n* **Tightness in the head:** The \"tightness\" you describe could be related to the epilepsy itself, or it could be a separate issue.  Your neurologist needs to evaluate this.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Schedule a follow-up appointment with your neurologist as soon as possible.**  Discuss your concerns about your memory, the \"tightness\" in your head, and your lack of improvement with the Carbamazepine.  Be sure to bring a list of all your medications.\n\n2. **Be patient and persistent.**  Finding the right medication and dosage for epilepsy often involves trial and error.  It takes time to see the full effects of treatment.\n\n3. **Consider a neuropsychological assessment.**  This type of testing can provide a more detailed evaluation of your cognitive abilities and help determine the extent of any memory impairment.  Your neurologist can refer you to a qualified professional for this.\n\n4. **Seek support.**  Living with epilepsy and the associated challenges can be emotionally draining.  Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist or counselor.\n\n5. **Do not stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor.**\n\n\nRemember, you are not alone. Many people live fulfilling lives with epilepsy.  With proper medical management and support, you can improve your quality of life and manage your symptoms effectively.  Focus on communicating openly and honestly with your neurologist, and be proactive in seeking the help you need.\n"

        "question": " Yet another EDIT: I fainted today on my way to the store and was brought into the hospital. They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder. Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a lot to process, and it's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and might worry about sounding \"insane.\"  You've experienced significant health events recently, and the information is coming in quickly.  Let's break it down:\n\n* **Silent Seizures:** The diagnosis of 6-10 silent seizures a day is a major finding.  This explains the fainting episode and likely other symptoms you may have dismissed or attributed to other causes. It's crucial to follow your doctor's recommendations for managing these seizures.\n\n* **Gastroparesis:** The potential diagnosis of gastroparesis offers a possible explanation for your weight loss and inability to keep food down.  This is a separate but potentially related issue.  The upcoming gastric emptying study will provide a more definitive diagnosis.\n\n* **\"Brain Zaps\":**  The distinction you're making between your experience of \"brain zaps\" and the common term used for medication withdrawal is important.  The fact that your episodes involved a loss of consciousness, even while remaining upright, is significant and clearly related to your seizures.\n\n* **Appetite Loss:**  Your doctors are investigating the appetite loss separately from any potential eating disorder, which is reassuring.  The gastroparesis could be a contributing factor.\n\n**In short:** You've received two significant diagnoses:  silent seizures and a potential case of gastroparesis.  Both require ongoing medical attention and management.\n\nIt's completely normal to feel overwhelmed by this new information.  Focus on:\n\n* **Following up with your doctors:**  Attend all appointments, ask questions, and keep a record of your symptoms.\n* **Getting sufficient sleep and managing anxiety:** Your doctors have already identified these as contributing factors to your seizures.\n* **Finding support:**  Talk to family, friends, or a therapist about your experiences.  A support system can be invaluable during this time.\n\nDon't worry about sounding \"insane.\" You're experiencing real medical issues that require professional attention.  You've made great progress in getting diagnosed, and now it's time to focus on treatment and recovery.\n"

        "question": "Age:18 Sex:F Weight:46 kg Height:1.61 cm So i have had histories of deja vu, it usually doesn\u2019t last long. I don\u2019t have them a lot, sometimes more sometime less. I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn\u2019t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can\u2019t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure. I have had no history of seizures before. I am so scared to sleep right now fearing that something might happen. It\u2019s probably about a year that this situation while i am trying to sleep happens. Wold really love to have an EEG bit when i went to the neurologist a year ago he only diagnosed me with anxiety combined with elements of OCD. He did some reflex/eyesight tests and all came back with no neurological deficit. I\u2019d get an EEG but i am literally such a hypochondriac that my parents are concerned and i just went through blood tests and i don\u2019t want to worry them again! If anyone has any idea i\u2019d be so glad :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're scared and worried.  Experiencing these sensations \u2013 buzzing, vibrations, racing heart, depersonalization, and dream flashbacks \u2013 alongside your anxiety about brain tumors and epilepsy, is extremely distressing.  However, it's important to remember that many things can cause these symptoms, and most are not serious.\n\nWhile I cannot diagnose you, your description strongly suggests that your symptoms are likely related to your anxiety and possibly OCD, as your neurologist previously diagnosed.  The anxiety itself can trigger physical symptoms like a racing heart, buzzing sensations (often described as tinnitus), and feelings of depersonalization.  The difficulty sleeping and racing thoughts are also classic anxiety symptoms.  Dream flashbacks, while less common, can also be linked to anxiety and stress.\n\nThe fact that your previous neurological exam, including reflex and eyesight tests, was normal is a very positive sign.  This significantly reduces the likelihood of a neurological condition like a brain tumor or epilepsy.  While an EEG could provide more information, given your neurologist's assessment and the lack of any history of seizures or other neurological deficits, it's unlikely to reveal anything significantly different.  Repeated testing, especially when driven by anxiety, can become counterproductive.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n* **Address the anxiety:** Your anxiety is clearly fueling your fears and making your symptoms feel worse.  Consider working with a therapist or counselor specializing in anxiety and OCD.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy are particularly effective treatments for these conditions.  They can teach you coping mechanisms to manage your anxiety and reduce the impact of your obsessive thoughts.\n* **Sleep hygiene:**  Improve your sleep habits.  Establish a regular sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, ensure a dark and quiet sleep environment, and avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n* **Mindfulness techniques:** Practices like meditation or deep breathing exercises can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety symptoms.\n* **Talk to your parents:**  Explain your fears and concerns openly and honestly.  Acknowledge their worry about your repeated testing, and explain how working on managing your anxiety could be more helpful in the long run than additional medical tests.  Consider bringing your concerns to your neurologist to discuss the pros and cons of another EEG.\n\n\n**When to seek immediate medical attention:**\n\nWhile your symptoms sound anxiety-related, seek immediate medical attention if you experience:\n\n* **Sudden, severe headache:**  Unlike typical tension headaches, this would be exceptionally painful and potentially accompanied by other neurological symptoms.\n* **Loss of consciousness:**  Even a brief loss of awareness needs immediate evaluation.\n* **Focal neurological symptoms:** Weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, visual disturbances.\n* **Seizures:** Any episode resembling a seizure (convulsions, loss of awareness, etc.).\n\nIt's important to manage your anxiety.  Focusing on evidence-based treatment and practicing self-care can significantly improve your well-being and reduce your fear.  Please talk to your doctor or therapist about your concerns and develop a plan to address your anxiety.  They can help you differentiate between anxiety symptoms and potential medical problems.\n"

        "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3\u2019s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're frustrated and in pain.  The dismissive treatment from the doctor is unacceptable, and it's compounded by the fact you're already dealing with so much.\n\nHere's a breakdown of advice, focusing on managing your pain and addressing your concerns:\n\n**Immediate Pain Management:**\n\n* **Tylenol 3 (Codeine):**  While you want to avoid relying solely on codeine, it *is* a prescribed pain reliever.  Follow the dosage instructions precisely.  Don't exceed them.  Combine it with other strategies to manage your pain.\n* **Heat/Cold:** Experiment with both heat packs and ice packs on your lower abdomen.  Some people find heat more soothing, while others prefer cold.\n* **Positioning:** Find positions that minimize the pain.  This might involve lying down with your knees bent, using pillows for support, or other comfortable positions.\n* **Distraction:** Engage in activities that distract you from the pain, even if it's just for short periods.  This could include watching a movie, listening to music, reading, or light meditation/mindfulness exercises (if you can tolerate it).\n* **Relaxation Techniques:** Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery can help to reduce overall tension and potentially alleviate some pain.  There are many free apps and guided meditations available online.\n* **Zofran:** Take this as prescribed to manage nausea.  Nausea can worsen pain perception.\n* **Toradol (Ketorolac):**  This is a strong NSAID.  Take it as prescribed, but be aware of potential side effects on your stomach.  Since you have gastroparesis, this might be problematic. If you notice any stomach upset, contact your doctor immediately.\n\n\n**Addressing Long-Term Concerns:**\n\n* **Second Opinion (Crucial):**  The experience with the second doctor underscores the need for a second opinion from a different doctor, ideally one specializing in endometriosis or gynecological pain.  Even if your surgeon is booked, try to reach out to someone in their practice.  Explain the situation clearly and emphasize your concerns about potential ovarian torsion.\n* **Advocate for Yourself:**  When speaking to medical professionals, be assertive but respectful.  Clearly state your pain level, symptoms, and concerns about ovarian torsion.  Bring a list of your questions and symptoms to appointments.\n* **Ovarian Torsion Risk:**  The fact that they saw multiple follicles doesn't rule out torsion.  Multiple follicles are consistent with PCOS.  The key is to get a conclusive diagnosis, which means pushing for more imaging.  If the pain worsens, *go back to the ER*.\n* **Seizure Risk:**  Increased pain can trigger seizures in some people with epilepsy.  If your pain is severe, be mindful of seizure triggers and perhaps consider discussing preemptive seizure measures with your neurologist (if you haven't already).  This might involve adjusting your medication.\n* **Narcotics Avoidance:**  It's wise to avoid long-term narcotic use.  However, short-term use for severe pain is sometimes necessary.  Make sure your doctor understands this concern.  If you feel your doctor isn't listening to your concerns about avoiding long-term opioid use, seek out another doctor's opinion.\n\n\n**Things to Consider While Waiting:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated.  Dehydration can worsen pain.\n* **Nutrition:**  Eat small, frequent meals that are easy to digest, given your gastroparesis.  Your gluten-free diet is important.\n* **Rest:** Try to get as much rest as possible.  Pain exhaustion is real.\n* **Support System:**  Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about how you're feeling.  Having a support system is crucial.\n\n\n**What to do *right now*:  **\n\n1. **Call your surgeon's office FIRST THING tomorrow morning.** Explain the situation urgently.\n2. **If the pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms (fever, severe nausea, inability to move your bowels), go immediately to the ER.**  Don't wait.\n\n\nThis situation is incredibly difficult, but remember you are not alone.  Be persistent in advocating for yourself and seeking appropriate medical care.  Your scheduled hysterectomy is a crucial step toward long-term pain management, but you need to navigate this immediate crisis effectively.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a concerning situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed.  The fact that your initial tests (CT, MRI, EEG) were unremarkable, despite experiencing seizures, makes finding the cause more challenging.  This is unfortunately a common experience for many with epilepsy.  Many cases, even with extensive testing, remain without a clear identifiable cause (idiopathic epilepsy).\n\nHere are some points to consider and discuss with your neurologist:\n\n* **Re-evaluation of existing conditions:** While your doctors may have already considered this, it's crucial to thoroughly explore how your existing conditions \u2013 major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and asthma \u2013 might *indirectly* contribute to seizure activity.  Severe emotional stress or sleep deprivation can trigger seizures in some individuals.  Are your mental health conditions well-managed?  Are you experiencing periods of significant stress or sleep disruption?\n\n* **Medication interactions:** The combination of medications you are taking is complex. While unlikely, there's a small possibility of an interaction contributing to seizures.  A detailed medication review with your prescribing physician or a pharmacist specializing in medication interactions is warranted.  This is particularly important given your use of Adderall, which can sometimes lower the seizure threshold in susceptible individuals.\n\n* **Substance use:**  While you've mentioned using cannabis and vaping, it's crucial to carefully evaluate the *frequency and amount* of your consumption.  Both can lower the seizure threshold, and even seemingly moderate use could be playing a role.  Discuss this openly and honestly with your neurologist.  They may recommend reducing or eliminating these substances completely for a period to see if it impacts your seizure frequency.\n\n* **Sleep deprivation:** This is a significant risk factor for seizures in some individuals. Ensure you are getting adequate, quality sleep.\n\n* **Further investigations:**  While the initial tests were unremarkable, more specialized testing might be considered:\n\n    * **Neuropsychological testing:** This can help assess cognitive function and look for subtle abnormalities that might be related to seizures.\n    * **Prolonged EEG monitoring (video EEG):** This involves wearing an EEG cap for an extended period (sometimes days) to capture seizure activity that might be missed during a shorter EEG.  This is often crucial in identifying subtle seizure patterns.\n    * **Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS):** This can detect subtle metabolic changes in the brain that might not show up on a standard MRI.\n    * **Repeat neuroimaging:** In some cases, subtle changes might only become apparent over time or with more advanced imaging techniques.\n    * **Genetic testing:** While you have no family history, genetic factors can play a role in epilepsy, even in the absence of a family history.\n\n\n* **Keppra Dosage and Efficacy:** Discuss with your neurologist whether the current Keppra dosage is sufficient to control your seizures.  If not, adjustments might be necessary.\n\n\nIt's essential to maintain open communication with your neurologist.  Keep a detailed seizure diary noting the time, duration, symptoms, and any preceding events (stress, sleep deprivation, etc.).  This information is invaluable in helping your doctor diagnose the underlying cause and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\nThe fact that you've experienced a grand mal seizure necessitates careful management and a proactive approach to identify the cause. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy if you feel your current treatment plan isn't addressing your concerns effectively.\n"

        "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable you're worried about your father.  His situation is complex, and it's difficult to say definitively whether stopping Xifaxan is causing the seizures.  Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n* **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and Seizures:**  While seizures are a *rare* complication of HE, they are possible.  The fact that your father's cognitive function seems relatively intact despite discontinuing Xifaxan doesn't rule out HE as a contributing factor to the seizures.  Xifaxan reduces gut bacteria that produce toxins which contribute to HE.  Stopping it could allow a build-up of these toxins, potentially triggering seizures in a susceptible individual.  The decreased insight, short-term memory loss, and reduced fluid intelligence you've observed are all suggestive of HE, even if subtle.\n\n* **Other Causes of Seizures in Cirrhosis:**  Cirrhosis itself can lead to seizures through several mechanisms, including electrolyte imbalances (which his low salt issue hints at), medications, and the direct effects of liver damage on brain function.  His history of alcohol abuse is also a significant risk factor for seizures, independent of HE. The motorbike accident is less likely to be a direct cause at this point, though past head trauma can increase seizure risk.\n\n* **The Role of Xifaxan:** Your father's decision to discontinue Xifaxan is a significant factor.  While his cognitive function seems relatively preserved, this is subjective.  Objective measures of cognitive function would be more informative. The fact that seizures have recurred after stopping the medication strongly suggests a possible link, even if it's not the sole cause.\n\n* **Keppra's Role:** Keppra is an anti-seizure medication, and its prescription implies the doctors are concerned about the seizures. However, it doesn't necessarily address the *cause* of the seizures.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. **Advocate for Comprehensive Assessment:**  Your father needs a thorough medical evaluation. This should include:\n    * **Detailed neurological exam:** To assess cognitive function objectively (beyond crossword puzzles).\n    * **Blood tests:** To check liver function, electrolytes (including ammonia levels, a key indicator of HE), and other relevant parameters.\n    * **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To detect any abnormalities in brain electrical activity that could explain the seizures.\n    * **Further imaging:** The fMRI is a good start, but other imaging modalities might be considered depending on the results.\n    * **Discussion of Xifaxan:**  Clearly communicate your concerns about the potential link between stopping Xifaxan and the recurrence of seizures.  Push for a discussion about the risks and benefits of restarting it, balancing the inconvenience of frequent bathroom trips against the risk of further seizures.\n\n2. **Open Communication with Doctors:** It's crucial to have open and honest communication with his medical team.  Share all the information you've provided here, emphasizing the timeline of events and your observations.  Try to understand their reasoning for not explicitly linking Xifaxan to the seizures.  If you're not satisfied with the explanations, seek a second opinion from a gastroenterologist or neurologist specializing in liver disease.\n\n3. **Respect His Autonomy:** While you can advocate for your father's health, you cannot force him to take medication.  Respecting his autonomy is important, but this needs to be balanced with the serious risks of his condition.  The discussion about the relative inconvenience of Xifaxan versus the risk of further seizures (and potential coma or death) is essential. You might try framing it in terms of quality of life.  What kind of life can he have if he continues to have seizures?\n\n4. **Emotional Support:** This is a stressful situation for both you and your father.  Consider seeking support from family, friends, or support groups for caregivers of individuals with liver disease.\n\nIn short, while there's no guarantee that stopping Xifaxan is the sole cause of the seizures, it's a strong possibility that requires careful investigation.  Focus on getting your father the most comprehensive medical assessment possible and having open communication with his healthcare providers.  The combination of cirrhosis, HE, and a history of seizures demands a proactive and thorough approach.\n"

        "question": "19F 167cm 59kg chinese in UK // \"passing out\" under certain conditions, suspected focal epilepsy?? duration: 3+ years?? (no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This sounds concerning and warrants a proper medical evaluation as soon as possible. While I cannot give medical advice, your description strongly suggests a need for a neurologist's assessment.  The fact that your episodes are triggered by specific visual stimuli (bright light in dim surroundings) is particularly important information.  This points towards a possible diagnosis like photosensitive epilepsy, a type of focal epilepsy.\n\n**However, it is crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot diagnose your condition.**  Your description aligns with several potential issues, and only a medical professional can determine the correct diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n**Here's what you should do:**\n\n* **Seek medical attention as soon as you can upon returning to the UK in October.**  Book an appointment with your GP immediately.  Explain everything in detail, including the specific triggers and the duration of your episodes.\n* **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the date, time, location, and circumstances of each episode.  Note down any premonitory symptoms you might experience before passing out.  This will be invaluable information for your doctor.\n* **Consider contacting a medical professional in your current location for urgent advice:** While you mention travel difficulties, if possible, try to contact a doctor or emergency service in your current location to discuss your situation.  They may be able to offer immediate guidance or suggest a place to receive assessment.\n* **Do not drive:** Given your episodes, it's unsafe to operate a vehicle. Inform anyone who might need to know (family, friends) of your condition and the safety restrictions you need to follow.\n* **Avoid your known triggers:**  Until you get a diagnosis and treatment plan, limit your exposure to bright lights in dark environments as much as possible.\n\n**Possible Diagnoses (for informational purposes only, not a diagnosis):**\n\n* **Photosensitive epilepsy:**  This is a form of epilepsy triggered by flashing or patterned visual stimuli.\n* **Vasovagal syncope:**  This involves fainting due to a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, sometimes triggered by specific stimuli.  However, the repetitive nature of your episodes and the visual trigger make this less likely.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  There are other potential causes, which a neurologist can investigate.\n\n\nYour symptoms are concerning enough to warrant immediate attention when you return to the UK.  Do not delay seeking professional medical help.  The information you've provided is helpful for your doctor, so keep a detailed record of your episodes.\n"

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

        "answer": "This is a complex situation, and it's understandable you're feeling frustrated and at a loss.  It sounds like your epilepsy has become significantly more challenging to manage, and the previous effective treatment is no longer working.  Let's break down your options and considerations:\n\n**What's happening?**\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to your worsening symptoms:\n\n* **H. pylori infection and antibiotics:** The antibiotics likely disrupted your gut microbiome, which can impact neurological function in some individuals.  This is an area of ongoing research, but it's plausible that the disruption contributed to a change in your epilepsy.  The acid reflux triggered by the antibiotics further complicates matters.\n* **Oxcarbazepine resistance:**  Unfortunately, epilepsy can develop resistance to medications over time. This is a common reason for treatment changes.\n* **Diet's role:**  The ketogenic diet seems to be offering some benefit by reducing the frequency and severity of your symptoms. This suggests a possible link between blood sugar fluctuations and your epileptic episodes. However, it's not a complete solution.\n* **Underlying cause:**  The initial cause of your epilepsy remains unclear.  The fact that your symptoms initially responded well to oxcarbazepine suggests a possible underlying seizure-causing condition.  Could other medical conditions be exacerbating things? (Have you had any relevant bloodwork/tests recently?)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Return to your Neurologist (urgently):** This is paramount.  Your recent worsening symptoms require immediate medical attention.  You need a thorough reassessment, including:\n\n    * **Detailed neurological exam:**  To assess the current severity and nature of your symptoms.\n    * **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To monitor brainwave activity and potentially identify seizure patterns.\n    * **MRI (magnetic resonance imaging):** To rule out structural changes in the brain that might be contributing to your epilepsy.\n    * **Blood tests:** To check for any underlying medical conditions, including metabolic issues or infections.\n    * **Discussion of medication changes:** Given the oxcarbazepine resistance, your neurologist will need to explore alternative anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).  There's a wide range of options available, and they'll need to consider your specific needs, history, and potential side effects.  Don't be afraid to discuss your concerns and preferences openly.\n    * **Referral to a gastroenterologist:** To assess your ongoing acid reflux and explore ways to manage it effectively. Addressing the reflux might lessen the frequency of symptoms.\n\n2. **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed journal of your symptoms, including:\n    * When they occur\n    * What you ate beforehand\n    * Your level of stress\n    * Any other relevant details (sleep, etc.)\n\nThis information will be invaluable for your neurologist.\n\n3. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Continue with the ketogenic diet and exercise, as these seem to be providing some relief. However, don't rely on them as the sole treatment.\n\n4. **Mental Health Support:**  Living with epilepsy can be emotionally challenging.  Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor to manage stress and anxiety related to your condition.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Safety:**  Avoid driving or operating machinery until your seizures are well controlled.\n* **Emergency Plan:**  Develop an emergency plan in case of a severe seizure.  Make sure those around you know what to do.\n\n**Regarding new medication:** Yes, the potential side effects of a new AED are a concern, but the significant impact your current symptoms have on your quality of life makes exploring new treatments a priority.  Your neurologist can discuss the risk/benefit ratio for different options.\n\n**In short:** Don't delay seeking medical attention. Your neurologist is your best resource for navigating this complex situation.  They can help you develop a comprehensive management plan that incorporates medication, lifestyle modifications, and ongoing monitoring.\n"

I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to say definitively whether this is an allergic reaction or something else without a proper medical evaluation.  The timing (appearing after multiple IV attempts) and location (directly at IV insertion sites) strongly suggest a possible reaction to something in the IV fluids or the materials used for the IV placement (e.g., tape, antiseptic).  However, other skin conditions could mimic this.\n\n**You should NOT try to self-treat this.**  While it *might* be a mild reaction, it could also be something more serious, and delaying proper medical attention could worsen the condition.  The fact you have epilepsy and are on multiple medications complicates things further, as interactions are possible.\n\n**Here's what you should do:**\n\n1. **Contact your doctor or surgeon immediately.**  Describe the rashes fully, including their location, appearance (red, elevated, itchy), and the timing related to the IVs.  They can assess the situation remotely or schedule an appointment as soon as possible.  This is especially important given your recent surgeries and the multiple medications you are taking.\n\n2. **Avoid scratching the rashes.**  Scratching can worsen the inflammation and increase the risk of infection.\n\n3. **Keep the areas clean and dry.**  Gentle washing with mild soap and water may help.  Avoid harsh chemicals or scented lotions.\n\n4. **Document the rashes.**  If possible, take clear photos to show your doctor.\n\n**Do NOT use any over-the-counter remedies without consulting your doctor first.**  Some topical creams could worsen the reaction or interact negatively with your other medications.\n\nIn short, while it *might* be a minor irritation, it's crucial to have a healthcare professional evaluate the rashes to rule out anything serious and determine the appropriate course of action.  Don't delay seeking medical advice.\n"

        "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about your mother's cognitive changes, especially given your medical background.  While it's impossible to give a diagnosis remotely, and your clinical reasoning shouldn't replace a proper medical evaluation, let's explore some possibilities and the role of screening tests.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis (excluding imaging/analytical findings):**  The symptoms you describe \u2013 difficulty transmitting information (with preserved comprehension), feeling overwhelmed by multiple tasks, and a history of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) \u2013 point towards several possibilities, not necessarily dementia.\n\n* **Persistent Post-Surgical Cognitive Dysfunction:** This is a crucial consideration, given her MCI developed after surgery 12 years ago.  The initial surgery may have caused subtle brain injury that has gradually worsened or manifested in new ways.\n\n* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Cognitive Symptoms:**  Her diagnosed depression could be significantly impacting her cognitive abilities.  Depression frequently presents with difficulties in concentration, memory, and executive function (planning, organizing). The difficulty transmitting information might be related to psychomotor slowing or lack of motivation.\n\n* **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Progression:** Her pre-existing MCI could be progressing, although the description suggests it might not yet meet the criteria for a major neurocognitive disorder (dementia).  The added stress of depression could exacerbate existing cognitive weaknesses.\n\n* **Anxiety Disorders:**  Feeling overwhelmed by multiple tasks could indicate an underlying anxiety disorder, which frequently co-occurs with depression and can mimic cognitive impairment.\n\n* **Other Neurological Conditions:**  Although you mention excluding obvious imaging/analytical findings, there could be subtle neurological issues not yet detected by standard tests.\n\n**Less Likely (but still possible):**\n\n* **Early-onset Dementia:** While less likely given her age and lack of family history, it's important not to entirely rule out dementing illnesses such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which can present with behavioral and language changes earlier than Alzheimer's disease.  However, the preserved comprehension argues against this being the primary diagnosis.\n\n\n**Role of MMSE + Clock Test:**\n\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and clock drawing test are screening tools, *not* diagnostic tests for dementia.  They can help identify individuals who *may* require further evaluation, but a low score doesn't automatically mean dementia.  Similarly, a normal score doesn't rule it out.\n\n* **Limitations:**  MMSE and clock tests are sensitive to education level, language, and other factors.  They primarily assess cognitive domains like orientation, memory, and attention, and may not capture subtle executive dysfunction or language difficulties that are key to some dementias.\n\n* **Use in Screening:**  These tests are useful for initial screening in a clinical setting.  A concerning score on either would prompt more comprehensive neuropsychological testing and possibly brain imaging (MRI, CT).\n\n**What your mother needs:**\n\nYour mother requires a thorough reassessment by her psychiatrist and possibly a neurologist.  This should include:\n\n* **Detailed cognitive assessment:**  Beyond MMSE and clock drawing, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery will provide a more nuanced picture of her cognitive strengths and weaknesses.\n* **Review of medications:** Some medications can exacerbate cognitive problems.\n* **Assessment of depression and anxiety:**  Appropriate treatment for these conditions could significantly improve her cognitive function.\n* **Consideration of other medical conditions:** A thorough physical examination and relevant blood tests can identify any other contributing factors.\n* **Brain imaging (MRI):**  If other assessments suggest a possible neurological cause for her cognitive decline, an MRI is warranted.\n\n**Your Role:**\n\nWhile you are a medical student, avoid making diagnoses for your mother.  Your role is to support her by carefully documenting her symptoms, ensuring she attends all appointments, and clearly communicating your concerns to her treating physicians.  Be her advocate and ensure she receives the best possible care from a qualified medical professional.  Your observations are valuable, but must be integrated into the professional assessment by her physicians.\n"

        "answer": "It's important to understand that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  Your elevated hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and hematocrit levels (all marked as \"high\" \u2013 H) indicate **polycythemia**, meaning you have an abnormally high number of red blood cells.  This is a serious condition that needs to be investigated and managed by a doctor.  While it's possible the symptoms you're describing (night sweats, itchiness after hot showers, fatigue) are unrelated, they could also be related to the polycythemia itself or a potential underlying cause.\n\n**Possible reasons for elevated red blood cells (and why you should see a doctor immediately):**\n\n* **Primary Polycythemia Vera:** This is a bone marrow disorder where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells.\n* **Secondary Polycythemia:** This is often caused by another condition, such as chronic lung disease (low oxygen levels), heart disease, or kidney tumors that produce erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production).  Living at high altitudes can also cause this.\n* **Dehydration:**  Severe dehydration can temporarily increase red blood cell counts, but your other symptoms suggest something more complex.\n\n**The symptoms you describe:**\n\n* **Night sweats:**  These can be a sign of many conditions, including infection, hormonal imbalances, and some cancers. In the context of your blood work, it's particularly important to investigate.\n* **Itchiness after hot showers:** This is a classic symptom of polycythemia vera, due to the increased blood volume and histamine release.\n* **Fatigue:**  Fatigue can be caused by many things, including sleep deprivation, vitamin D deficiency, anemia (ironically, the opposite of your current condition), and other medical conditions.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Schedule an appointment with your doctor or hematologist immediately.**  Do not delay.

        "answer": "This is a detailed and concerning presentation of symptoms. It's crucial to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  Your description necessitates a thorough evaluation by your neurologist and potentially other specialists.  The fact that your recent EEG didn't definitively show a seizure despite a witnessed episode warrants further investigation.\n\nHere are some key points and potential avenues for your neurologist to explore:\n\n* **Discrepancy between witnessed events and EEG:**  The discrepancy between the nurse witnessing an episode and the EEG being inconclusive is a major red flag.  This could indicate:\n    * **A type of seizure not easily detectable by standard EEG:**  There are many types of seizures, some subtle and difficult to capture on EEG.  Advanced EEG techniques (e.g., video-EEG monitoring) may be necessary.\n    * **Non-epileptic seizures (NES):**  These are episodes that resemble seizures but have a different underlying cause, often psychological or related to other neurological issues.  Further psychological evaluation might be helpful.\n    * **Technical limitations of the EEG:**  While unlikely, there's always a possibility of technical issues affecting the EEG's accuracy.\n\n* **Widespread symptoms:** The breadth of your symptoms (pins and needles, muscle spasms, shaking, urge incontinence, Raynaud's, narcolepsy, etc.) suggests a possible underlying systemic issue that may or may not be directly related to your epilepsy and narcolepsy.  This warrants further investigation.  Consider the possibility of:\n    * **Autoimmune disorders:**  Several autoimmune diseases can manifest with a wide array of neurological and other symptoms.\n    * **Connective tissue disorders:** These can impact the nervous system.\n    * **Small fiber neuropathy:** This can cause widespread paresthesia (pins and needles) and other symptoms.\n\n* **The \"episodes\":**  The description of your episodes \u2013 including the inability to speak, eye rolling, muscle heaviness, lip drooping, head turning, and altered recall \u2013 requires careful differentiation between epileptic seizures and other neurological events (NES or other).\n\n* **Medication interactions:** While Nuvigil and Ambien are commonly prescribed, their interaction with Vimpat should be closely monitored.  Your neurologist should be aware of all medications and supplements you are taking.\n\n* **Impact of Physical Activity:** Your increased physical activity might exacerbate some symptoms, or conversely, be helping alleviate others.  This needs to be factored into any assessment.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Discuss your concerns with your neurologist immediately:**  Express your worries about the EEG results and the continued occurrence of concerning episodes.  Specifically, ask about the possibility of non-epileptic seizures, video-EEG monitoring, and further investigations into potential underlying systemic causes.\n* **Keep a detailed seizure diary:**  Record the date, time, duration, and all associated symptoms of each episode.  This is crucial for your neurologist.\n* **Consider seeking a second opinion:**  If you remain unsatisfied with the explanation and treatment plan from your current neurologist, consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and related disorders.  A neurologist specializing in movement disorders might also be beneficial.\n\n\nYour symptoms are complex and warrant a thorough multidisciplinary approach. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask questions until you feel your concerns are adequately addressed.\n"

        "question": "An MRI with Neuroquant showed these normative percentiles: Hippocampal Occupancy Score \u2013 32 Hippocampi \u2013 72 Superior Lateral Ventricles \u2013 94 Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74 The hippocampal volume seems normal but the hippocampal occupancy score is very low. What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward. My information: 24F, 110 pounds, conditions: epilepsy, history of COVID, history of vaccine reaction, medications: Trileptal, location of problem: brain, duration: 9 months",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The MRI results show a discrepancy: your hippocampal volume is within the normal range (72nd percentile), but your hippocampal occupancy score is low (32nd percentile). This is important because it suggests a problem *within* the hippocampus, rather than a simple reduction in overall size.  The occupancy score reflects how much of the hippocampal space is actually occupied by hippocampal tissue. A low score could indicate:\n\n* **Atrophy or damage within the hippocampus:** This could manifest as cell loss or damage to the hippocampal structure, even if the overall volume remains relatively normal.  This is a key finding given your symptoms.\n* **Measurement error:** While less likely, there's always a possibility of some variation in MRI interpretation or measurement.\n\n**The discrepancy between volume and occupancy, coupled with your symptoms (memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, depression), strongly suggests further investigation is warranted.** Your history of COVID-19, vaccine reaction, and prior CBD use further complicates the picture.  It's impossible to definitively say what caused this, and a single MRI isn't enough to reach a diagnosis.\n\n**Regarding your theory about the virus attacking the hippocampus:** While viral infections *can* affect the brain, causing inflammation and damage, it's difficult to definitively link your symptoms to a direct viral attack on the hippocampus based on this information.  The temporal relationship between your COVID-19 infection/vaccine reaction and symptom onset is suggestive, but doesn't prove causation.  The CBD use also adds another potential confounding factor, as it has been linked to cognitive changes in some individuals.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\n1. **Follow up with your neurologist or the physician who ordered the MRI immediately.**  Discuss these results in detail. They should consider the clinical picture in context with the imaging findings.\n2. **Explore additional investigations:** This might include other neuropsychological tests (to further assess memory and cognitive function), potentially a repeat MRI, or even more advanced imaging techniques (e.g., functional MRI, MRS - magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to better understand the nature of the hippocampal abnormality.\n3. **Consider other differential diagnoses:** Your symptoms could be related to several conditions, including:\n    * **Post-viral encephalitis:** Inflammation of the brain following a viral infection.\n    * **Neuroinflammation:** General inflammation in the brain.\n    * **Depression and anxiety (with cognitive impairment):**  Your pre-existing depression might be exacerbated by your other experiences, causing cognitive difficulties.\n    * **Other neurological conditions:**  The complete picture needs to be considered by a specialist to rule out other conditions.\n\n**Prognosis:**  It's impossible to predict the prognosis without a proper diagnosis and a comprehensive evaluation.  The good news is that the hippocampus has some capacity for neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to reorganize itself), and early intervention can often lead to better outcomes.  However, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This information is for general knowledge and discussion purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

Has anyone heard of any data related to the Covid vaccine and GBS and/or is there a better choice when choosing between brands.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) given your history and epilepsy medication.  The risk of GBS is indeed very rare with both flu and COVID-19 vaccines, significantly lower than the risk of getting GBS from the actual illnesses.\n\n**Regarding COVID-19 vaccines and GBS:**\n\nSeveral large-scale studies have analyzed the incidence of GBS following COVID-19 vaccination.  The overall findings consistently show a very low risk, comparable to or even lower than the background rate of GBS in the general population.  While some individual cases have been reported,  they don't demonstrate a causal link and are statistically insignificant compared to the millions who have received the vaccines.  No specific COVID-19 vaccine brand has consistently shown a higher risk of GBS than others in these studies.\n\n**Which COVID-19 vaccine is \"better\"?**\n\nThere isn't a single \"best\" COVID-19 vaccine for everyone, especially considering your specific situation.  The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and the Novavax protein subunit vaccine are all highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19.  The choice often depends on individual factors like age, underlying health conditions, and vaccine availability.\n\n**Your situation requires a discussion with your doctor:**\n\nGiven your history of epilepsy and concern about GBS, **it's crucial to discuss your COVID-19 vaccination options with your neurologist or primary care physician.** They can weigh the individual risks and benefits based on your specific health profile and medical history.  They're best equipped to advise on the most appropriate vaccine for you.  Your doctor might also want to review your epilepsy medications to ensure they are optimal and aren't exacerbating any potential risks.\n\n**In short:**  While the risk of GBS from COVID-19 vaccines is exceedingly low, the decision should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, who can consider your medical history and assess the best course of action for you.  Don't rely solely on online information for this critical decision.\n"

Neurology only wants to repeat an mri once per year to rule out ms",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your symptoms are complex and concerning, and it's understandable you're feeling frustrated with the lack of a clear diagnosis.  The combination of rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK levels), heat intolerance, progressive numbness/burning, muscle spasms, and fatigue points towards several possibilities, but none are immediately obvious.  The fact that your neurologist is considering MS and Lyme but also notes low testosterone adds another layer of complexity.\n\n**Why the current diagnostic path might be insufficient:**\n\n* **Rhabdomyolysis:** This is a serious condition indicating muscle breakdown.  Recurring episodes suggest an underlying cause needs to be identified beyond just \"overheating.\"  What triggers your episodes?  Stress?  Specific activities?  Certain foods?  Detailed tracking of your symptoms and activities is crucial.\n* **Heat Intolerance:** This isn't typically a primary symptom of MS or Lyme, making it a crucial piece of the puzzle.  Certain metabolic disorders or other neuromuscular conditions could be contributing factors.\n* **Progressive Neurological Symptoms:** The spreading burning sensation and worsening muscle spasms indicate the problem might be worsening and requires more aggressive investigation.  Yearly MRIs for MS are insufficient if symptoms are progressing this rapidly.\n* **Low Testosterone:** While testosterone replacement might help with some symptoms, it's unlikely to address the underlying cause of the rhabdomyolysis and neurological issues.\n\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Advocate for yourself:** You need a more aggressive diagnostic approach.  Your description warrants more than annual MRIs.  Request a second opinion from a different neurologist or consider seeing a neuromuscular specialist.\n2. **Detailed symptom diary:** Keep a meticulously detailed diary noting:\n    * **Timing and severity of symptoms:**  When do symptoms occur? How intense are they?\n    * **Triggers:** What activities, foods, environmental factors, or stresses precede symptom flares?\n    * **Medication use:**  Note any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're taking.\n    * **CK levels:** Keep track of your CK levels and the circumstances surrounding spikes.\n3. **Genetic testing:**  Consider genetic testing to rule out rare inherited muscle disorders that could cause rhabdomyolysis and heat intolerance.\n4. **Metabolic panel:**  A comprehensive metabolic panel might reveal underlying metabolic abnormalities contributing to your symptoms.\n5. **Muscle biopsy:**  If other tests are inconclusive, a muscle biopsy might provide valuable insights into the muscle damage occurring during rhabdomyolysis episodes.\n6. **Inflammatory markers:**  Thorough blood tests should include inflammatory markers to help rule out or confirm inflammatory conditions.\n7. **Lyme disease testing:** Ensure Lyme testing is comprehensive and includes testing for various stages of infection.\n8. **Cardiac evaluation:** While unlikely, given the initial lightning bolt sensation, consider a thorough cardiac evaluation to rule out any underlying cardiac issues.\n\n**Important Note:**  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information above is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.  You must work closely with your healthcare providers to develop a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment plan.

        "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling confused, frustrated, and ashamed after experiencing two seizures and receiving conflicting information about your diagnosis.  The experience is frightening and disorienting, and it's completely normal to have doubts and anxieties.\n\nLet's break down your concerns:\n\n* **Conflicting Diagnoses:**  The fact that someone else described a similar experience and it turned out to be a vasovagal episode is important, but it's not definitive proof that *your* condition is the same. Vasovagal syncope and epilepsy share some symptoms (sudden loss of consciousness, sometimes with jerking movements), but they have different underlying causes and treatments.  Only a neurologist can accurately differentiate between the two.  Online forums are not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n* **Epilepsy Diagnosis:** The discharge diagnosis of epilepsy was made by medical professionals after witnessing your seizures.  This is significant. While a single seizure doesn't automatically mean epilepsy, the recurrence within a few days strongly suggests a higher likelihood of epilepsy.  However, further investigations might be needed to confirm the type of epilepsy and rule out other potential causes.\n\n* **Lamictal Side Effects:**  Memory problems are a known potential side effect of Lamictal (lamotrigine).  It's crucial to discuss these side effects with your doctor.  They might be able to adjust the dosage or explore alternative medications to minimize the negative impact while maintaining seizure control.  Stopping the medication abruptly is dangerous and could lead to more seizures.\n\n* **Seeking Help:**  You're clearly struggling with the emotional toll of this.  Consider these steps:\n\n    * **Return to your neurologist:** Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns about the diagnosis, the side effects of Lamictal, and your anxieties.  Bring a detailed list of your symptoms, the dates of your seizures, and any other relevant information.  Asking for further testing (EEG, MRI) is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n\n    * **Seek psychological support:**  A therapist or counselor can help you process the emotional impact of your seizures, including feelings of shame, fear, and uncertainty.  They can provide coping mechanisms and strategies for managing anxiety.\n\n    * **Support groups:**  Connecting with others who have epilepsy can be incredibly beneficial.  Sharing experiences and learning from others can reduce feelings of isolation.\n\n**Important:** Do *not* stop taking Lamictal without consulting your doctor.  Stopping anti-seizure medication abruptly can significantly increase the risk of more seizures, which can have serious consequences.\n\n\nIn short, rely on professional medical advice, not online forums.  Your neurologist is the best resource to determine the correct diagnosis and treatment plan.  Openly communicating your concerns and symptoms to them is crucial for your well-being.\n"

        "question": "24 F USA Asthma, epilepsy, hypothyroidismI have laryngeal candidiasis (unknown cause but thought to be from Breo and prednisone?) and it isn't responding much to fluconazole. The next step is amphotericin b and I'm kinda nervous. What should I expect realistically?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're nervous about starting amphotericin B.  It's a powerful antifungal medication with the potential for significant side effects.  Let's break down what you can realistically expect:\n\n**Possible Side Effects:**  Amphotericin B, especially the conventional formulation (not liposomal), is notorious for its side effects.  These can range from mild to severe:\n\n* **Infusion-related reactions:**  These are common, especially with the first few infusions.  They can include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, and muscle aches.  Pre-medication with antipyretics (fever reducers) and antihistamines is often used to minimize these.\n* **Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity):** This is a major concern.  Your kidney function will be closely monitored with blood tests (BUN and creatinine) before, during, and after each infusion.  Amphotericin B can damage the kidneys, potentially leading to decreased kidney function or even kidney failure in severe cases.  Adequate hydration is crucial to help mitigate this risk.\n* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Changes in your blood levels of potassium, magnesium, and calcium are possible.  These imbalances can cause various symptoms, including muscle weakness, heart rhythm problems, and seizures.  Electrolyte levels will be monitored regularly.\n* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** This can occur during or after the infusion.\n* **Liver problems (hepatotoxicity):**  Less common than kidney problems, but still a possibility.  Liver function tests will be monitored.\n* **Anemia:**  A decrease in red blood cells.\n* **Other potential side effects:**  These can include fatigue, loss of appetite, and digestive problems.\n\n**What to Expect During Treatment:**\n\n* **Frequent blood tests:**  To monitor your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood count.\n* **Close monitoring:** Your doctor will want to see you regularly to assess your response to the treatment and monitor for side effects.\n* **Intravenous (IV) administration:**  Amphotericin B is typically given intravenously, usually in a hospital or clinic setting.  The infusion rate will be carefully controlled.\n* **Duration of treatment:** The length of treatment will depend on your response to the medication and the severity of your infection.\n\n**Important Considerations Given Your Existing Conditions:**\n\nYour asthma, epilepsy, and hypothyroidism add layers of complexity.  Your doctor needs to carefully manage these conditions alongside the amphotericin B treatment.  For example:\n\n* **Epilepsy:**  Some side effects of amphotericin B (e.g., electrolyte imbalances) could potentially trigger seizures.  Your anti-epileptic medication will likely need to be monitored closely.\n* **Hypothyroidism:**  Amphotericin B can interact with thyroid medications.  Your thyroid hormone levels will need to be checked regularly.\n* **Asthma:**  While not directly impacted, any significant side effects from amphotericin B could exacerbate your asthma symptoms.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n* **Talk to your doctor:** Have an open and honest conversation with your doctor about your concerns.  Discuss the potential benefits and risks of amphotericin B in detail.  Ask about specific side effects you should watch out for and what to do if they occur.\n* **Ask about liposomal amphotericin B:**  This formulation is generally better tolerated than the conventional formulation and has fewer side effects, especially on the kidneys.  If it's an option, it may be worth discussing.\n* **Keep a detailed record:** Note down any side effects you experience, along with their severity and timing.  This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n* **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of fluids to help protect your kidneys.\n* **Follow your doctor's instructions carefully:**  Adhere to all medication instructions and attend all scheduled appointments.\n\n**In short:** Amphotericin B is a potent medication, and while it can be very effective against laryngeal candidiasis, it does carry risks.  Open communication with your doctor, careful monitoring, and proactive management of potential side effects are crucial for a successful outcome.  Don't hesitate to express your concerns and ask questions.  You are your best advocate in this situation.\n"

During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your boyfriend's situation is complex and requires careful consideration. While he's been tested for epilepsy and other neurological conditions, the fact that his episodes are clearly linked to anxiety and panic, and occur only in anxious situations, strongly suggests a non-epileptic seizure (NES), also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES).\n\nSeveral key points support this hypothesis:\n\n* **Trigger:**  The clear link to fear of needles and medical procedures is crucial.  Epileptic seizures are rarely so predictably triggered.\n* **Loss of consciousness:** While possible in epilepsy, the description of \"the light going further and further away\" is more suggestive of a dissociative experience common in PNES.\n* **Motor activity:** The kicking, trembling, and shaking are consistent with PNES.  The movements in epileptic seizures often have a different character.\n* **Normal neurological tests:** Repeated normal EEG and blood tests further point away from epilepsy.\n* **Purple face:**  While concerning, cyanosis (turning blue or purple) can occur during any severe episode involving breath-holding or intense physical exertion, which can happen during a panic attack.\n\n**The crucial next step is a proper diagnosis of PNES.** This often requires a specialist in epilepsy and/or psychiatry who can conduct a thorough evaluation, potentially including:\n\n* **Video-EEG monitoring:** This involves staying in a hospital for a period while brainwave activity is monitored during a spontaneous episode. This is the gold standard for differentiating PNES from epilepsy.\n* **Psychiatric evaluation:** A detailed assessment of his anxiety, panic disorder, and depression, including exploring trauma history.\n* **Psychological testing:** To further understand the underlying psychological mechanisms.\n\n\n**Why previous treatments might not have worked:**\n\n* **CBT alone may be insufficient:** While CBT is helpful for anxiety, it needs to specifically address the trauma associated with needles and medical procedures through systematic desensitization and exposure therapy, but done gradually and under close supervision.  The single attempt with blood draw might not have been enough to make a difference.\n* **Lack of PNES-specific treatment:**  If the diagnosis is indeed PNES, treatment focuses on managing the underlying anxiety and panic disorder.  This might involve different types of therapy beyond CBT, such as trauma-informed therapy, and potentially medication adjustments.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Advocate for a referral to an epileptologist or neurologist specializing in PNES:**  This is the most critical step.  Clearly explain his history, focusing on the trigger and the specific description of the episodes.\n2. **Be supportive and patient:**  This process can be lengthy and challenging. Your support is crucial.\n3. **Learn about PNES:**  Understanding the condition will help you better support your boyfriend and communicate effectively with medical professionals.\n4. **Avoid calling an ambulance unless absolutely necessary during future episodes:** While your response was understandable, repeated ambulance calls can be costly and potentially unhelpful if the root cause is psychological.\n\n\nIt's essential to remember that PNES is a treatable condition. With the right diagnosis and treatment, your boyfriend can significantly improve his quality of life.  Don't give up hope \u2013 persistent advocacy for specialized care is vital.\n"

        "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these new symptoms.  The brain zaps you're experiencing, especially with the accompanying numbness in your tongue, are concerning and warrant investigation, even if your doctor initially ruled out Straterra as the cause.  While your doctor's suggestion of an MRI is a good starting point, the fact that you've had one before without issue doesn't entirely rule out new developments.\n\nSeveral possibilities exist, and it's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide a diagnosis.  Your description overlaps with symptoms of several conditions, some more serious than others:\n\n* **Medication Withdrawal/Discontinuation Syndrome:** While your doctor discounted it, inconsistent Straterra use *could* still be contributing, even if you've now established a routine.  The brain zaps are a commonly reported symptom of antidepressant withdrawal, and the timing of your symptoms suggests a possible connection.  It's worth discussing this possibility again with your doctor, emphasizing the timing and the tongue numbness.  They might consider adjusting your medication gradually or trying a different approach.\n\n* **Sleep Disorders:**  Sleep deprivation or disruptions in sleep cycles can trigger unusual neurological sensations.  Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns recently?  Conditions like sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome could contribute.\n\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:**  While your past MRI was normal, the new symptoms warrant further investigation. The combination of brain zaps and tongue numbness suggests a neurological event that wasn't present before.  The MRI should be thorough, potentially including a focus on the brainstem and cranial nerves which are responsible for tongue function.  Additional neurological tests might be necessary, depending on the MRI results.\n\n* **Other Medical Conditions:**  Less likely, but certain electrolyte imbalances or other underlying medical conditions could potentially contribute.\n\n**Why it's important to see a specialist:** Given the complexity of your case and the new, concerning symptoms, a consultation with a neurologist is highly recommended.  A neurologist specializes in the nervous system and can perform a more comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed neurological exam and potentially additional tests beyond the MRI. They can correlate your history of neurological disorders with these new symptoms better than your primary care physician.\n\n**What you can do now:**\n\n* **Keep a detailed log:**  Record the frequency, duration, and intensity of the brain zaps and tongue numbness. Note any other accompanying symptoms (headaches, dizziness, etc.).  This information will be valuable for your doctor.\n* **Discuss this with your doctor:** Emphasize your concerns and the specific symptoms you're experiencing, particularly the tongue numbness.  Request a referral to a neurologist.\n* **Avoid self-treating:** Do not adjust your medication without consulting your doctor.\n\nIt's crucial to seek professional medical attention to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

        "question": "Age 23 Sex M Hypertension, Hypothyroid, pre-diabetes, ADHD, Anxiety Disorder and panic attacksOkay so my MRI's report is normal, here:https://imgur.com/a/OiCEZ3N I get these body jerks so the doctor was thinking it's Myoclonic Epilepsy or Motor Tics. But the Motor Tics medicine isn't doing any good to me so the doc was thinking about Myoclonic Epilepsy. But my MRI report is fine? Do i still need to worry? I have ADHD, Panic attacks and Anxiety Disorder problems and even normal MRI is killing me inside why am i having those jerks!?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand your anxiety.  It's completely normal to be worried when you're experiencing unexplained symptoms, especially when medical tests initially seem inconclusive.  However, a normal MRI doesn't automatically rule out all neurological conditions.  Many neurological conditions don't show up on an MRI.\n\nYour doctor is considering Myoclonic Epilepsy and motor tics as possible causes of your body jerks.  The fact that tic medication isn't helping points towards the possibility of myoclonic epilepsy, but it's important to note that there are many other potential causes for these jerks that aren't necessarily epilepsy.  \n\n**Here's what's important to consider:**\n\n* **Your existing conditions:**  Your ADHD, anxiety, and panic attacks can significantly impact your perception of bodily sensations.  Anxiety itself can cause muscle twitches and jitters.  It's crucial for your doctor to fully evaluate whether these symptoms are related to your existing conditions or something entirely separate.\n* **The nature of the jerks:** Are they brief, involuntary muscle spasms?  Do they occur randomly or in a pattern?  Do they occur during sleep?  Are they associated with any other symptoms, like loss of consciousness, changes in vision, or altered mental status?  Detailed descriptions to your doctor are essential for accurate diagnosis.\n* **Further investigations:**  An MRI is a valuable tool, but it's not the only one.  Your doctor might consider an EEG (electroencephalogram) to assess your brain's electrical activity. This is much more sensitive for detecting epileptic activity than an MRI.  A neurological exam focusing on reflexes and muscle strength will be another important step.  There are other less common possibilities that further investigation may unveil.\n* **Differential diagnosis:** The doctor needs to consider all possible causes, including those related to your existing conditions, medication side effects, sleep deprivation, caffeine or other substance use, electrolyte imbalances, and other neurological issues.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Talk to your doctor:**  Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns in detail. Provide as much information as possible about the jerks: frequency, duration, when they occur, anything that seems to trigger them, etc.\n* **Be honest and thorough:** Don't hesitate to mention even seemingly minor details. Your complete medical history, including medications, supplements, and lifestyle factors, is crucial for a proper evaluation.\n* **Ask questions:** Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about the next steps in diagnosis, what other tests might be necessary, and the potential causes and treatments for your symptoms.\n* **Consider a second opinion:** If you feel unsure or unsatisfied with the diagnosis or treatment plan, seeking a second opinion from a neurologist is always an option.\n\nIt's understandable that you're feeling anxious.  However, focusing on getting a proper diagnosis through thorough investigation is the best way to alleviate your worry and manage your condition.  Don't self-diagnose based on internet searches; rely on the expertise of your healthcare provider.\n"

        "question": "The other day I didn't use the dosage cup and just swallowed some Pepto-Bismol Max. I guess it was maybe a mouthful? I don't know how much that is but it felt like a \"large swallow\". Maybe as much as the max daily dosage of 120mL. That was all I had for at least 24 hours in either direction.I don't think I feel any symptoms different than what I usually feel. I read that toxicity can cause confusion and ringing in the ears. But I always seem to have ringing in the ears from time to time, and I have epilepsy so I'm always a little tired and confused (I take carbamazapine 300mg 2x).How concerned should I be? 28 year old white male. About 160lbs and 5'6",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While it's impossible for me to say definitively whether you've experienced any adverse effects from taking an unknown amount of Pepto-Bismol Max, your description doesn't suggest immediate cause for significant alarm.  You haven't reported any serious symptoms like confusion significantly different from your baseline, or severe tinnitus (ringing in the ears).  The fact that you haven't experienced any symptoms for at least 24 hours post-ingestion is also reassuring.\n\nHowever,  it's crucial to understand that **exceeding the recommended dosage of Pepto-Bismol can be dangerous**, even if you don't immediately notice symptoms.  The bismuth subsalicylate in Pepto-Bismol can cause bismuth toxicity at high doses, and the symptoms can be delayed.  Long-term or high-dose use can also lead to problems such as neurological issues.  Your pre-existing epilepsy and medication could potentially interact with bismuth in unforeseen ways, which makes proper dosage even more important.\n\n\n**I strongly recommend that you contact a doctor or pharmacist.** They can assess your situation based on your individual health profile, including your epilepsy medication and your symptoms (or lack thereof).  It's better to err on the side of caution, even if you feel fine, to rule out any potential long-term consequences.\n\nDon't rely on online information to self-diagnose or treat potential medication overdose. Professional medical advice is essential in this case.\n"

        "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This situation is incredibly serious and distressing.  Your girlfriend's symptoms are concerning, and the lack of a diagnosis after extensive testing is frustrating and understandably terrifying.  The temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and the vaccinations is striking, but it's crucial to remember correlation doesn't equal causation.  Many things can cause fainting and seizures, and a vaccine reaction, while possible, needs to be carefully evaluated against other possibilities.\n\n**What needs to happen immediately:**\n\n1. **Seek a specialist immediately:**  You need a neurologist specializing in autonomic dysfunction (problems with the involuntary nervous system) and/or a cardiologist experienced in syncope (fainting).  The fact that standard neurological tests haven't revealed anything suggests the problem may be outside the typical scope of neurology.  Autonomic dysfunction can manifest with many of the symptoms described.  Emphasis should be on finding a doctor willing to observe her during an episode, if possible.  This is critical for diagnosis.  If she's reacting badly to medication, that needs to be explicitly communicated to any new specialists.\n\n2. **Advocate for additional testing:**  Suggest the following to the specialists:\n\n    * **Tilt-table test:** This tests for orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing).  This is a common cause of fainting.\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG) during an episode (if possible):**  While previous EEGs might have been normal, one *during* a seizure or fainting episode is vital.\n    * **24-hour Holter monitor:** This continuously monitors heart rhythm.\n    * **Autonomic nervous system testing:**  This can identify problems with the involuntary nervous system's regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and other functions.\n    * **Blood tests:**  To rule out metabolic disorders, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions.\n    * **Detailed neurological exam focusing on cranial nerves:**  A thorough assessment of cranial nerve function might reveal subtle neurological deficits.\n    * **Consider a neuroimmunology consult:**  Given the temporal association with vaccination, exploring the possibility of a post-vaccination autoimmune response affecting the nervous system could be worthwhile.\n\n3. **Document everything meticulously:** Keep a detailed diary of every episode, noting the time, triggers (if any), duration, symptoms (convulsions, hyperventilation, etc.), and any medications taken beforehand. This diary will be invaluable for any doctor trying to piece together the puzzle.\n\n4. **Seek support:**  This is incredibly stressful.  Find support groups for people with unexplained medical conditions or fainting.  Consider therapy for both of you; coping with this situation is emotionally taxing.\n\n**Possible Explanations (requiring medical investigation):**\n\n* **Autonomic dysfunction:** This is a strong possibility given the symptoms (fainting, hyperventilation, dizziness, lightheadedness, changes in heart rate).\n* **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS):**  A form of autonomic dysfunction that involves an abnormal increase in heart rate when standing up.\n* **Conversion disorder (functional neurological disorder):** While you've ruled out underlying mental health issues, this is a possibility that some doctors might consider.  However, the clear temporal link to the vaccination makes this less likely than other organic causes.\n* **Rare adverse reaction to the vaccine:** Although unlikely, some rare neurological side effects can occur following vaccination.  This needs to be investigated by a specialist.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Suicidal ideation:** Your girlfriend's suicidal thoughts are a serious concern.  Immediate mental health support is crucial.  She needs to be connected with a crisis hotline or mental health professional immediately.  The mental health toll is adding to the physical one.\n\n* **Second opinions:**  Don't hesitate to seek second and third opinions from specialists in relevant fields.\n\n* **Refusal of doctors:** If doctors are dismissive, find new ones.  Document their responses, and be assertive in advocating for your girlfriend's care.  Your description suggests a need for a more thorough and investigative approach from the medical professionals.\n\n\n\nThis is a complex case requiring a multidisciplinary approach.  The urgency of the situation cannot be overstated.  Don't give up seeking answers.  Persistent advocacy for thorough investigations is critical.  The immediate priority is to get her to a specialist who can properly assess her during an episode and conduct the appropriate tests.\n"

        "question": "I\u2019m a 23 year old female. I have recently been getting very dizzy, my body gets hot and seeing stars until my vision disappears completely and I can\u2019t see at all and it doesn\u2019t go away until I lay down or sit. I have never had a problem like this ever but it\u2019s starting to interfere with my life because I\u2019m always having to sit. I\u2019m 5\u201d3 and I weigh around a 100 pounds. My weight does fluctuate a lot (+ or - 5 pounds every week) I try to eat healthy but I also sometimes can\u2019t get myself to eat because I feel anxiety and my heart starts beating weird. I also have epilepsy and I am on Keppra and have been on it for almost 3 years so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem but I try to take it on time, I take 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don\u2019t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time. I add a lot of salt on my food, I eat a lot of olives and a lot of pickles, sometimes I will individually season spoonfuls or food before putting them in my mouth because it\u2019s what tastes good to me (if that is of any significance)And I do drink alcohol about 3 times a week",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Yes, you should be concerned and seek medical attention immediately.  The symptoms you describe \u2013 dizziness, intense heat, seeing stars, complete vision loss requiring you to lie down \u2013 are serious and could indicate a number of underlying health problems.  They are not typical side effects of Keppra, though medication interactions are always a possibility.\n\nSeveral possibilities need to be ruled out by a doctor:\n\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up.  Your weight fluctuations, high salt intake (which can temporarily mask the problem), and alcohol consumption could all contribute to this.  The dizziness, seeing stars, and vision loss are classic symptoms.\n\n* **Dehydration:** While you mention eating habits, significant dehydration can cause similar symptoms, especially with the combination of alcohol consumption.\n\n* **Cardiovascular Issues:**  The combination of dizziness, heat, and heart palpitations warrants a thorough cardiovascular evaluation.  This could range from benign arrhythmias to more serious problems.\n\n* **Neurological Conditions:** While you're on Keppra for epilepsy, the new symptoms could indicate a different neurological issue or an interaction with another factor.  A neurological examination is essential.\n\n* **Anemia:**  Low iron can cause dizziness and fatigue.\n\n* **Other Underlying Medical Conditions:** Several other conditions could potentially cause these symptoms.\n\n**The high salt intake is concerning and could be exacerbating the problem.**  While salt is essential, excessive consumption can negatively impact blood pressure and hydration.\n\n**The fact that this started recently and is happening frequently necessitates immediate medical attention.** Don't wait;  make an appointment with your doctor or go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room as soon as possible.  Be sure to provide them with all the information you've described here.  They may order blood tests, an EKG, and other tests to determine the underlying cause.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat.**  Your health is paramount, and a professional medical evaluation is crucial to identify and address the root cause of your symptoms.\n"

I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're exploring all options for managing your refractory epilepsy.  While laser surgery and VNS are significant steps, it's good to consider all possibilities before committing to invasive procedures.\n\nLet's address the suggestions you've received:\n\n* **Chiropractic treatment and acupuncture:**  There's currently **no robust scientific evidence** to support the use of chiropractic treatment or acupuncture as effective treatments for epilepsy.  While some people report feeling better after these treatments, the improvements aren't directly linked to seizure control in controlled studies.  These therapies might help manage stress or pain associated with epilepsy, but they shouldn't be considered a replacement for established medical treatments.\n\n**Other options you should discuss with your neurologist or epilepsy specialist:**\n\n* **Ketogenic Diet:**  A strict ketogenic diet has shown some effectiveness in reducing seizures for certain types of epilepsy.  It's a very restrictive diet, requiring close medical supervision.\n* **Cannabidiol (CBD):**  While you're already using cannabis, the specific CBD content might need to be assessed.  High-CBD, low-THC products are sometimes investigated as an adjunctive therapy, but again, this needs to be carefully monitored by your doctor due to the potential interactions with your current medications.  It's crucial to use only products from reputable sources with verified CBD content.\n* **Other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs):** Your doctor might consider adding or switching to different AEDs, depending on the type of seizures you are experiencing. There's a wide range of AEDs available, and finding the right combination often involves trial and error.\n* **Responsive neurostimulation (RNS):**  This is a less invasive option than VNS and involves a device implanted in the brain that detects and responds to abnormal brain activity.\n* **Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS):** You mentioned this, and it's a well-established treatment option.\n* **Dietary supplements:**  Always discuss any supplements with your doctor, as some can interact negatively with your medications.\n\n**Regarding your lifestyle:**\n\n* **Cannabis use:**  While cannabis can have some relaxation effects, its impact on seizure control is complex and not consistently positive.  Discuss this thoroughly with your doctor, as the effect could be variable, and there's a need to carefully monitor interactions with your other medication.  Your doctor might suggest a reduction or cessation of cannabis use depending on seizure frequency and its impact on your overall condition.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **EMU (Epilepsy Monitoring Unit):**  This is crucial for accurate diagnosis.  The EMU will help pinpoint the origin of your seizures, which is essential for surgical planning.\n* **Neuropsychological testing:**  This helps assess cognitive function and can be beneficial in planning treatment strategies.\n\n**In summary:**  While alternative therapies like chiropractic and acupuncture may offer comfort or stress reduction, they should not be considered primary treatments for refractory epilepsy.  Work closely with your epilepsy specialist.  Be open and honest about all aspects of your lifestyle, including cannabis use.  They can help you navigate the options and create a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs and situation.  Don't hesitate to ask many questions and seek second opinions if needed.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you describe are concerning and warrant further investigation, but they don't definitively point to epilepsy.  While some aspects overlap with seizure symptoms, others don't, and the rapid diagnosis of epilepsy without clear evidence of seizures (loss of consciousness) is indeed questionable.\n\n**Reasons why it might *not* be epilepsy:**\n\n* **Absence of typical seizure activity:**  The most crucial aspect of epilepsy is the occurrence of seizures, which are characterized by altered consciousness, often involving convulsive movements or staring spells. While your involuntary grimacing could be interpreted as a subtle motor symptom, the lack of complete loss of consciousness and the predominant focus on nausea, speech difficulties, and head pressure weakens the case for epilepsy.\n* **\"Feeling ill\" as the primary symptom:**  The initial wave of nausea strongly suggests a different origin.  Seizures typically begin with the neurological symptoms, not a general feeling of malaise.\n* **Focal pressure sensation:** The feeling of your forehead being swollen is atypical for epilepsy. This suggests a potential localized issue, possibly related to headaches, sinus problems, or other neurological conditions.\n\n**What it *could* be:**\n\nSeveral conditions could explain your symptoms:\n\n* **Migraine variants:**  Given your history of childhood migraines, this is a very strong possibility.  Migraines can present atypically in adults, manifesting with various neurological symptoms without the classic throbbing headache.  The nausea, speech disturbance, and even the facial grimacing are consistent with certain migraine types.\n* **Vestibular migraine:** This type of migraine affects the balance system, leading to dizziness, nausea, and sometimes neurological symptoms.\n* **Tension-type headaches:** These can cause intense head pressure and associated symptoms.\n* **Sinusitis:**  Infection or inflammation in the sinuses could cause pressure in your forehead and facial discomfort.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  While less likely given the negative MRI and EKG, further investigation might be needed to rule out other conditions.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion:**  Find a neurologist with a reputation for thoroughness and a willingness to explore different diagnostic avenues.  Don't hesitate to explain your concerns about the rapid epilepsy diagnosis and your reluctance to take anti-seizure medication without more concrete evidence.\n2. **Keep a detailed diary:**  Document the timing, duration, and specific symptoms of each episode. This will provide valuable information to your doctor.  Note any triggers you might identify (stress, food, sleep deprivation, etc.).\n3. **Consider additional testing:**  Your doctor might suggest further tests, such as:\n    * **EEG (electroencephalogram):**  To monitor brainwave activity during both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods. This is crucial for diagnosing epilepsy.\n    * **More detailed neurological exam:**  Focusing on cranial nerves and other potential sources of your symptoms.\n    * **Blood tests:**  To rule out infections or other metabolic disorders.\n    * **Possible referral to other specialists:** Depending on the results, you may need to see an otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) to rule out sinus issues.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  It's crucial to be evaluated by a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.  Self-treating is dangerous and can delay proper diagnosis and treatment. Your hesitation about anti-seizure medication is understandable, and a thorough investigation is warranted before such medication is prescribed.\n"

The fact that you're experiencing these twitches, especially in conjunction with loss of concentration and a prior seizure (even if attributed to dehydration), warrants a visit to a doctor or neurologist.  While dehydration was cited as the cause of your previous seizure, the recurring twitches linked to refocusing suggest something else might be going on.\n\nThe twitches you describe, occurring only when you attempt to refocus after a loss of concentration, aren't typical of most seizure types. However, they could be a subtle manifestation of a neurological issue, or even a non-neurological problem causing brief myoclonic jerks.  Myoclonic jerks are brief, involuntary muscle spasms.  They can have many causes.\n\n**You should absolutely seek medical attention for this.**  Don't rely on online information to self-diagnose.  A neurologist can perform a thorough examination, potentially including an EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor brainwave activity, and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.  This is crucial to rule out any serious conditions and receive appropriate treatment.\n\nDelaying medical evaluation could potentially be harmful.  Schedule an appointment with your doctor or a neurologist as soon as possible to discuss your concerns and undergo a proper assessment.  They can provide a diagnosis and appropriate management plan.\n"

        "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the sudden onset, the specific phases, the detailed recall, and the visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there, like a door frame being too small or a clone), this situation warrants a doctor's visit sooner rather than later. While it *could* be a manifestation of anxiety related to her ADHD, the characteristics described go beyond typical sleepwalking or night terrors.\n\nHere's why a doctor's visit is recommended:\n\n* **Sudden Onset:** The abrupt appearance of these episodes after the trip is significant.  This suggests a potential trigger or underlying medical issue.\n* **Distinct Phases:** The structured progression of the episode, from screaming to rocking to specific requests, isn't typical of simple sleepwalking or anxiety-related sleep disturbances.\n* **Hallucinations:** The reported visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) are a key concern and need professional evaluation.  This isn't usually associated with typical sleepwalking or night terrors.\n* **Specific Requests:** The urgent, precise requests, like needing a blue marker to write a word or arranging a blanket in a specific way, point towards a possible neurological or psychological process beyond simple anxiety.\n* **Cefixime Use:** While a UTI and antibiotic treatment are relatively common, it's worth mentioning to the doctor.  While rare, some medications can have unusual side effects on sleep.\n\n**What the doctor might consider:**\n\n* **Partial Seizures:** The described symptoms, particularly the hallucinations, specific requests, and post-ictal (after the event) shaking, raise the possibility of partial seizures, even if they're quite short.  An EEG (electroencephalogram) might be necessary to rule this out.\n* **Sleep Disorders:**  While you've considered anxiety, other sleep disorders should be evaluated.  A sleep study might be helpful if the episodes persist.\n* **Underlying Neurological Conditions:**  Though less likely, other neurological conditions should be considered as part of a comprehensive assessment.\n* **Anxiety and ADHD Interaction:** While the ADHD and therapy are relevant, the severity and specific nature of these episodes might require a reevaluation of her anxiety management plan.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your daughter's pediatrician or family doctor as soon as possible.**  Explain the episodes in detail, including the phases, the hallucinations, and the timeline. Mention the recent trip and the antibiotic use.\n2. **Keep a detailed sleep diary.** Note the time of onset, the duration of each phase, the specific requests, and anything else you observe.  This will be valuable information for the doctor.\n3. **Mention this to her therapist** at the multidisciplinary clinic as well. They can offer additional support and collaborate with the physician.\n\nDon't dismiss these episodes as simply anxiety-related until a thorough medical evaluation has been completed. The unusual nature of these episodes requires professional medical attention.\n"

        "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand you're in a very difficult situation.  It's incredibly frustrating to be struggling with your mental health while facing difficulties accessing healthcare.  **Please do not stop taking your Citalopram (Celexa) abruptly.**  Suddenly stopping an SSRI can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which can be quite unpleasant and even potentially worsen your depression and anxiety.  These symptoms can include dizziness, nausea, headache, anxiety, and even more severe symptoms in some cases.\n\nWhile it's possible that the Citalopram isn't the right medication for you, or that the dose needs adjusting, only your doctor can assess this and suggest a safe course of action.  It's also true that SSRIs can initially worsen depression or anxiety in some individuals before becoming effective, or they may simply not be the right medication for you.  This initial worsening is often temporary.\n\n**Regarding your questions:**\n\n* **Can SSRIs make you more depressed?** Yes, it's a possibility, especially during the initial phase of treatment or when adjusting the dosage.  It's also possible the increased dose isn't the cause and your depression is worsening for other reasons, such as a concurrent medical issue or unrelated life stressor.  A doctor needs to evaluate this.\n\n* **What to do until your appointment:**  Continue taking your prescribed Citalopram as directed until you can see your GP.  In the meantime, try to access support in other ways.  Consider calling your GP's surgery again frequently to see if any cancellations have opened up.  You can also try contacting mental health helplines such as Samaritans (116 123 in the UK) or the NHS 111 service for urgent mental health support.\n\n* **Choosing a new antidepressant:**  It's impossible for me to recommend a specific antidepressant.  The best choice depends on various factors, including your medical history, other medications you're taking (like Topiramate), and your individual response to medications.  Your GP will consider all of this when making recommendations.  You've already tried several antidepressants, which makes it even more important to have a professional guide you through this.  The potential interaction between amitriptyline and topiramate (both used for migraines) requires professional medical assessment.\n\n* **Your concern about myoclonic jerks and fatigue:** These are important considerations when selecting medication.  Your GP can discuss options that minimize these side effects.\n\n**In short:**  Please do not stop your Citalopram suddenly.  Keep trying to get an appointment with your GP; call frequently.  Seek support from mental health helplines in the meantime.  Your doctor is the best resource to help determine the cause of your worsening depression and to find the most appropriate treatment plan for you.\n"

We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",

        "answer": "This parent is understandably experiencing significant anxiety and fear following their son's severe seizure.  Their concerns are valid, but it's crucial to address them with professional help to prevent the anxiety from negatively impacting both the parent and child's well-being.  This response is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n**Points to address with a pediatric neurologist or epileptologist:**\n\n* **Likelihood of breakthrough seizures:**  The neurologist can assess the risk of future generalized seizures based on the son's medical history, EEG findings (if available), and response to Keppra. They can discuss the possibility of adjusting medication or adding other treatments to minimize this risk.  The fact that the seizure was a focal seizure that generalized suggests a possible focal origin that may or may not be easily controlled by medication.  The neurologist should discuss this.\n\n* **Keppra efficacy and long-term management:**  The long-term effectiveness of Keppra in preventing seizures is something the neurologist should discuss.  Seizure control can change over time, and medication adjustments may be necessary.  The neurologist will monitor the son's progress and make appropriate recommendations.  They can also discuss the possibility of other epilepsy syndromes.\n\n* **Anxiety management for the parent:** The parent's intense anxiety is a serious issue requiring professional attention. The neurologist can refer the parent to a therapist or psychiatrist specializing in anxiety disorders, potentially suggesting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other coping mechanisms.  Support groups for parents of children with epilepsy could also be beneficial.\n\n* **Strategies to reduce parental overprotectiveness:** A therapist can help the parent develop strategies to manage their anxiety and gradually reduce their overprotective behaviors. This might involve gradual exposure therapy (slowly increasing social interactions and activities), mindfulness techniques, and learning to trust the medical team and their son's resilience.\n\n* **Addressing specific concerns:** The parent's fears about fevers, crowds, and activities need to be addressed in the context of their son's specific risk profile. The neurologist can provide guidance on managing fevers safely and determining which activities pose acceptable risks.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Re-evaluation:**  A comprehensive neurological re-evaluation, including EEG and potentially MRI, would be very useful to better understand the son's epilepsy and refine treatment strategies.\n\n* **Seizure detection devices:** While the son might not be a great fit for *some* seizure detection devices, exploring other options is crucial.  There are various types available, and a neurologist can help find a suitable one.\n\n* **School and therapy:** Gradually reintroducing in-person therapies and school attendance should be done in a measured way, guided by the neurologist and therapist.  A phased approach, focusing on building the child's confidence and the parent's sense of security, would be most beneficial.\n\n* **Support systems:** Connecting with other parents of children with epilepsy through support groups can provide valuable emotional support and practical advice.\n\nIn summary, this family needs a multidisciplinary approach involving a pediatric neurologist, a therapist experienced in anxiety disorders, and potentially other specialists as needed. The goal is to optimize the child's seizure control, improve the parent's mental health, and allow the child to live a full and happy life.  The current level of anxiety is unsustainable and requires professional intervention.\n"

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and desperate after years of searching for answers.  The symptoms you describe are complex and concerning, and it's commendable that you've been so proactive in seeking help.  The fact that manipulating your TMJ provides temporary relief is a significant clue.  However, I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses.  The information below is for discussion with your doctor, not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nHere's what you should discuss with your doctor this week, emphasizing the points below:\n\n**Crucial points to discuss with your doctor:**\n\n* **Detailed Temporal Description of Symptoms:**  Don't just say \"every couple of seconds.\"  Try to quantify the frequency and duration of the \"blanking out\" episodes.  For example, \"approximately 60 times per minute, each lasting about a half-second.\" The more precise you are, the better.\n* **TMJ Manipulation:**  Explain precisely how you manipulate your TMJ, showing her the technique.  The temporary relief is key.  This suggests a possible connection between your jaw, blood vessels in the area, and your neurological symptoms.\n* **The \"Warm and Liquidy\" Sensation:** This is important sensory data.  Describe it thoroughly.  It could indicate vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) in response to your manipulation.\n* **Vascular Issues:** Your suspicion about a subdued or compromised artery near the TMJ is a valid hypothesis.  Ask your doctor to specifically consider the possibility of vascular compression or dysfunction affecting blood flow to the brain.  They might order further imaging (angiography, for example) to visualize the blood vessels in that area.\n* **Neurological Exam:** Request a thorough neurological exam to rule out other potential causes, including migraines, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or other neurological conditions.\n* **Cervical Spine Re-evaluation:** Even though previous imaging was normal, the consistent temporary relief from TMJ manipulation suggests a possible link to the upper cervical spine.  Ask for a more detailed examination of the upper cervical spine, perhaps including specific imaging focusing on the area of the vertebra next to the TMJ.\n* **Additional Imaging:** Advocate for additional imaging, possibly including:\n    * **Carotid Ultrasound:** To assess blood flow in the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain.\n    * **Angiography (DSA):**  A more detailed imaging technique to visualize the blood vessels in and around the TMJ.\n    * **Further neurological testing:** EEG, EMG might be considered.\n* **Differential Diagnoses:** Based on your description, your doctor should consider, but not be limited to, these possibilities in their differential diagnoses:\n    * **Vertebrobasilar insufficiency:** Reduced blood flow to the posterior portion of the brain.\n    * **Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ) with secondary neurological symptoms:**  The temporary relief from TMJ manipulation strongly points to this.\n    * **Cervicogenic headache:** Headaches originating from the neck.\n    * **Vascular compression syndrome:**  A rare condition where a blood vessel is compressed, affecting blood flow to the brain.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Suicidal Thoughts:**  You mentioned suicidal thoughts.  Please, please reach out to a crisis hotline or mental health professional immediately. You are not alone, and help is available.\n* **Second Opinion:**  If you're not satisfied with your doctor's assessment, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in vascular disorders or a specialist in TMJ disorders.\n\nYour symptoms are complex and require a thorough investigation.  By meticulously documenting your symptoms, the temporary relief from TMJ manipulation, and advocating for additional testing, you're increasing the chances of receiving an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Remember, persistent advocacy is crucial in situations like these.  Don't give up hope.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to have questions about seizures, especially with a personal history. Let's address your points:\n\n**Can you feel a seizure in your head?**\n\nYes, the feeling of a seizure can begin in the head.  While many seizures spread to other parts of the body, causing visible motor symptoms, some seizures, particularly focal seizures (originating in one area of the brain), can manifest initially with subtle changes in thought, perception, or sensation that *feel* like they are originating in the head. These might include:\n\n* **Aura:** A warning sign that precedes a more significant seizure. Auras can take many forms, including visual disturbances (flashing lights), olfactory hallucinations (strange smells), auditory hallucinations (hearing sounds), or unusual feelings (e.g., a rising feeling in the stomach, tingling).  These auras are often localized in the brain and felt in the head initially.\n* **Focal aware seizure:**  These seizures affect a specific part of the brain and the person remains conscious. The symptoms depend on the brain region involved. If it's a part of the brain associated with sensations, the person may experience altered sensations *in their head*  (like a strange pressure, numbness, or tingling).\n\nGoogle's statement about seizures spreading from head to body is a general description, not universally true.  The experience is highly variable.\n\n**Why don't all seizures show up on EEG?**\n\nElectroencephalograms (EEGs) measure electrical activity in the brain.  However, not all seizures involve large-scale, easily detectable changes in electrical activity.  Several factors contribute to this:\n\n* **Subtle electrical changes:** Some seizures involve subtle disruptions in brain activity that are below the detection threshold of an EEG.\n* **Timing:** The seizure might have ended before the EEG is performed. EEGs typically capture a snapshot of brain activity.  A brief seizure might be missed.\n* **Location:** The seizure might occur in a brain region whose electrical activity is poorly detected by scalp electrodes (the sensors used in an EEG).\n* **Type of seizure:** Certain seizure types, particularly absence seizures, may have minimal or no detectable changes on a routine EEG.  More specialized EEG techniques may be needed.\n\n**Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one?**\n\nYes, this is possible, particularly with subtle or non-convulsive seizures.  A person might experience a brief period of altered awareness, confusion, or amnesia (memory loss) without realizing they've had a seizure.  Later, they might feel fatigued, have a headache, or have a vague sense that something unusual happened\u2014the \"feeling like you had one.\" This is sometimes called a post-ictal state (the period after a seizure).\n\n**Articles for Further Reading:**\n\nUnfortunately, I can't directly link articles. However, searching reputable medical websites like the Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS, part of the NIH) will provide extensive information on seizures, EEG interpretation, and different seizure types.  Search terms like \"types of seizures,\" \"focal seizures,\" \"EEG and seizures,\" and \"post-ictal state\" will be helpful.\n\n**Important Note:**  Given your history of seizures, even though it's been a while, if you're experiencing any new or concerning neurological symptoms, it is crucial to consult your neurologist.  They can assess your situation, perform any necessary tests, and provide personalized advice and management.\n"

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccine given your history of a neurological reaction to a flu shot after your GBS.  Your concerns are valid, and it's crucial to have a thorough discussion with your doctors before making a decision.\n\nHere's a breakdown of considerations:\n\n**Factors Favoring COVID-19 Vaccination:**\n\n* **High Risk Due to Underlying Conditions:**  Your autoimmune diseases (Hidradenitis Suppurativa and the undiagnosed one),  history of GBS, and current high ESR/CRP levels put you at significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 complications.  COVID-19 can affect multiple organ systems, including the neurological system, and could be far more serious than a flu shot reaction.\n* **Neurologist's Recommendation:** Your neurologist's strong recommendation carries significant weight. They are aware of your medical history and the risks associated with both COVID-19 and potential vaccine side effects in your specific case.\n* **Protection Against Severe Illness:** While no vaccine is 100% effective, the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.  This is especially important given your health profile.\n\n\n**Factors Against COVID-19 Vaccination (and how to address them):**\n\n* **Previous Neurological Reaction:** This is your biggest concern.  Discuss this thoroughly with both your neurologist and rheumatologist.  They can assess the specifics of your past reaction (severity, duration, etc.) and help determine the likelihood of a similar reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.  It's important to understand *why* you had the reaction to the flu shot. Was it a direct causal link or coincidental?  This information will influence their assessment.\n* **Specific Vaccine Considerations:**  Discuss different vaccine types (mRNA vs. others) with your doctors.  There might be a preferred type based on your history, although the current evidence suggests the risk of serious adverse events is quite low across vaccine types.\n\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Rheumatologist:**\n\n* Your history of GBS and the flu shot reaction.\n* Your current symptoms (episcleritis, joint pain, high ESR/CRP).\n* Your concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n* The possibility of pre-medication (such as steroids) before vaccination, which *might* mitigate a potential reaction, though this would be a very individualized decision based on your specific risk assessment.\n\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Detailed Discussion with Rheumatologist:**  Have a frank and open conversation with your rheumatologist.  Bring a list of your questions and concerns.  Get their professional opinion on the risk/benefit ratio for you.\n2. **Shared Decision-Making:**  This is a crucial point.

        "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

        "answer": "Your concerns are absolutely valid, and your background in mental health research gives you valuable insight into the situation.  Your boyfriend's symptoms are far beyond what's typical for a panic disorder, especially given their frequency, severity, neurological components (loss of balance, slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, fainting), and the fact that he has little to no recall of the events.  The fact that he's experiencing these symptoms even without alcohol use is a significant red flag.\n\nThe inadequate response from his psychiatrist and the emergency room is deeply concerning.  Dismissing such severe symptoms as \"bad anxiety\" after negative MRI and EEG results is not sufficient.  While those tests rule out *some* possibilities (like stroke and typical seizures), they don't rule out other neurological conditions,  underlying medical issues, or even complex interactions between mental and physical health.\n\n**Here's why a neurologist is crucial, and what you should do:**\n\n* **Neurological Symptoms:** The neurological symptoms\u2014loss of balance, slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades, fainting\u2014strongly suggest a neurological problem needs investigation.  These are not typical panic attack symptoms.\n* **Amnesia:** The post-event amnesia is particularly alarming. This suggests a possible dissociative episode or other neurological event, rather than solely a panic attack.\n* **Severity and Frequency:** The attacks lasting 3-6 hours, occurring multiple times a week, are incredibly debilitating.  This isn't the typical presentation of a panic disorder.\n* **Inadequate Treatment:** His psychiatrist's response is completely insufficient. Lowering the Lyrica dosage while his symptoms are worsening is counterintuitive.  Prescribing Silexan, a supplement, in place of more effective treatments shows a lack of understanding or attention to his condition's severity. The refusal to consider Ativan, a benzodiazepine which can be used as needed to help break a severe panic episode, is concerning.\n\n**Your Action Plan:**\n\n1. **Advocate Aggressively:**  You need to be your boyfriend's strongest advocate.  This means documenting *everything*: the dates and times of symptoms, their duration and severity, any triggering factors, and his responses to treatments.  This meticulous documentation will be crucial for convincing other medical professionals.\n\n2. **Seek a Second Opinion (and a Third, if Needed):**  You need to find a different psychiatrist *and* push for a neurology referral.  Don't just accept the current doctor's dismissal.  If you can't change doctors through the formal channels, explore different avenues, such as contacting patient advocacy groups in Quebec.\n\n3. **Explore Different Healthcare Avenues:** Consider:\n    * **Urgent Care Clinics:**  They might be more willing to assess him than the ER, especially with your detailed documentation.\n    * **Neurology Clinics:**  Try contacting neurology clinics directly; some may have quicker access than going through a family doctor or referral.\n    * **Hospital-Based Mental Health Teams:**  Many hospitals have teams specializing in complex cases; they might be more receptive to your concerns.\n\n4. **Consider Telehealth Options:** If in-person appointments are difficult to secure, explore telehealth options.  Some platforms offer virtual consultations with specialists.\n\n5. **Safety First:** Your boyfriend's suicidal ideation is a serious concern.  Ensure he has support and isn't alone.  If he is at immediate risk, call emergency services or crisis support lines.\n\n6. **Support Groups:** Connecting with support groups for individuals with neurological conditions or those experiencing complex mental health challenges could provide valuable emotional support and information sharing.\n\n**Possible Diagnoses to Consider (This is NOT a diagnosis, just a list of possibilities that require professional medical evaluation):**\n\n* **Complex Partial Seizures:**  These can mimic panic attacks and cause neurological symptoms, including amnesia.\n* **Conversion Disorder:**  A somatic symptom disorder where psychological distress manifests as neurological symptoms.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** Similar to conversion disorder, characterized by neurological symptoms without a clear underlying neurological cause.\n* **Underlying Medical Condition:**  A rare metabolic disorder, autoimmune disease, or other medical issue could be contributing to his symptoms.\n\n**Remember:** Your gut feeling is important. You've noticed something is seriously amiss, and it's essential to keep pushing for a thorough investigation until your boyfriend receives the proper care and diagnosis.  Don't give up. His life depends on it.\n"

        "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you find the coincidence of your son's epilepsy and Chiari malformation striking, and it's natural to question whether they're connected.  While doctors may say they're unrelated, let's explore why that might be the case and what further considerations are important.\n\n**Why Doctors Might Say They're Unrelated:**\n\n* **Prevalence:**  Both Chiari malformation and epilepsy are relatively common conditions.  The sheer number of individuals with each means that coincidental occurrences are statistically likely.  Just because they exist simultaneously doesn't automatically imply a causal link.\n* **Lack of Established Causal Mechanism:**  Currently, there's no established scientific mechanism explaining how a Chiari malformation directly causes generalized epilepsy.  While both involve the brain, the specific pathways and processes are distinct.\n* **Different Pathologies:** Chiari malformation is a structural abnormality where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures resulting from abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  These are different types of problems.\n\n**Reasons for Further Investigation and Questions to Ask:**\n\nDespite the doctors' assessment, several points warrant further discussion and potential investigation:\n\n* **The Severity of the Chiari Malformation:** A 15mm herniation is significant. While it might not directly *cause* the epilepsy, it could potentially *exacerbate* existing neurological issues or contribute to other symptoms.  Ask your neurologist and neurosurgeon about the potential for the Chiari malformation to impact other aspects of your son's neurological development and health.  Are there any symptoms related to the Chiari that need monitoring or treatment (headaches, neck pain, balance issues, etc.)?\n* **Epilepsy Etiology:** The cause of your son's epilepsy is still unknown.  A thorough workup might be warranted to investigate potential underlying causes, even if a Chiari malformation isn't believed to be the direct cause. This could involve further genetic testing or other specialized neurological investigations.\n* **Syndrome Consideration:**  While unlikely, some rare syndromes involve both Chiari malformation and epilepsy.  It's important to rule out any such possibilities.\n* **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of both the epilepsy and the Chiari malformation is crucial.  Regular neurological check-ups and imaging studies will be vital to track any changes and adjust treatment plans as needed.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhile the direct causal link between your son's Chiari malformation and epilepsy might be unlikely, their simultaneous presence warrants careful monitoring and ongoing dialogue with his medical team.  Don't hesitate to ask detailed questions, seek second opinions if you have concerns, and advocate for a comprehensive evaluation to understand both conditions thoroughly and ensure your son receives the best possible care.  Your persistence in asking questions is crucial for ensuring your son's well-being.\n"

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated and anxious after five years of unexplained double vision episodes.  The fact that so many tests have come back negative makes it even more challenging.  While I cannot diagnose medical conditions, I can offer some suggestions based on your detailed description:\n\n**Possible Avenues to Explore:**\n\n* **More in-depth neurological examination:**  While you've seen neurologists, it's worth considering a second opinion, ideally from a neurologist specializing in neuro-ophthalmology (eye-related neurological conditions).  They might employ more specialized tests to look for subtle issues not detected previously.  This could include:\n    * **Visual evoked potentials (VEPs):**  These tests measure the electrical activity in the brain in response to visual stimuli and can help identify problems along the visual pathway.\n    * **Oculomotor testing:** More detailed assessments of eye movements and coordination.\n    * **Neuroimaging (MRI or fMRI with different sequences):**  While previous scans were negative, newer techniques or a different focus might reveal something.  Mention the recent episode with significantly worse double vision.\n    * **Autonomic nervous system testing:** Given the 40-minute duration and the slight disorientation preceding the episodes, there's a remote possibility of a subtle autonomic nervous system dysfunction triggering the visual disturbances.  This is less likely given the lack of other symptoms, but worth mentioning to a neurologist.\n\n* **Consider less common conditions:**  While unlikely given the negative tests, some rare conditions affecting the cranial nerves or brainstem could cause episodic double vision.  Discuss these with your neurologist:\n    * **Intermittent cranial nerve palsies:**  These are sometimes triggered by viral infections or other factors.\n    * **Brainstem disorders:**  While large lesions are usually detected on MRI, small or subtle issues might be missed.\n\n* **Detailed symptom diary:** You've already done some self-monitoring, but a more formal diary might be useful.  Include:\n    * Precise time of onset and offset.\n    * Exact nature of the double vision (horizontal, vertical, distance between images).\n    * Any accompanying sensations (headache, nausea, lightheadedness, changes in heart rate).\n    * Preceding activities or circumstances.\n    * Any changes in medications or supplements.\n    * Stress levels around the time of episodes.\n\n* **Head injury follow-up:** Your history of concussions, even minor ones, should be carefully reviewed by a neurologist.  Long-term effects from head trauma can sometimes manifest years later.\n\n* **Psychogenic factors:** Although you're responsive and coherent, it's worth briefly mentioning this possibility to your neurologist as a rule-out.  While less likely given the objective nature of the double vision, ruling it out completely is important.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Second Opinion:**  Given the duration and lack of diagnosis, seeking a second or even third opinion from a neuro-ophthalmologist is highly recommended.\n* **Cost of Care:**  Explore options for reducing the cost of specialty appointments.  Some hospitals offer financial assistance programs or sliding-scale fees.  Your insurance may also cover a portion of the cost.\n* **Anxiety Management:**  The uncertainty is undoubtedly stressful.  Consider strategies to manage anxiety, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or therapy.\n\n\nThis information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  It's crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.  The persistent nature of your symptoms warrants further investigation.\n"

        "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand your concern for your brother's safety and well-being.  It's crucial to find a solution that balances his need for mobility and exercise with the risk of falls. However, I must strongly advise against trying to build or use a \"cage\" or heavily restrictive device for managing his falls.  This approach carries significant risks:\n\n* **Safety Hazards:** A homemade device is unlikely to meet safety standards and could malfunction, causing further injury.  The sudden impact of a 250lb fall could easily break or damage the device, leading to more serious consequences.\n* **Psychological Impact:**  A cage-like structure could be incredibly distressing and psychologically damaging for your brother.  It would limit his autonomy and dignity.\n* **Medical Necessity:**  The underlying cause of his falls (fainting spells or mini-seizures) needs professional medical diagnosis and management.  A mechanical device is not a substitute for proper medical care.\n\nInstead of focusing on a restrictive device, I strongly recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Immediate Medical Attention:**  Prioritize getting a proper diagnosis from a neurologist or epileptologist.  They can determine the cause of the fainting spells, rule out epilepsy or other neurological conditions, and recommend appropriate treatment.  This is the most crucial step.\n\n2. **Physical Therapy:**  A physical therapist can assess your brother's strength, balance, and gait and develop a tailored exercise program to improve his stability and reduce fall risk. This would be far more effective and humane than a restraining device.\n\n3. **Assistive Devices:**  Consider safer, medically approved assistive devices like:\n\n    * **A gait trainer:** This provides support and stability while walking.\n    * **A walker with brakes:** Offers additional support and control.\n    * **A specialized harness:**  Some harnesses are designed to help prevent falls, but they would be used with supervision and not in a cage-like structure.  They would be part of a structured fall-prevention strategy, not a restraint.\n\n4. **Weight Management:**  Once the underlying medical condition is addressed, work with your brother and a doctor or dietitian on a safe and effective weight loss plan.  Remember, his health should be the absolute priority, and gradual weight loss is safer than drastic measures.\n\n5. **Fall Prevention Strategies at Home:**  Make your home safer by removing tripping hazards, improving lighting, and installing grab bars in the bathroom.\n\n**In summary:**  While your intention is to protect your brother, a homemade restraint is not the answer.  Focus on medical diagnosis, professional therapy, and appropriate assistive devices to address both his falls and his weight.  This approach is much safer, more humane, and more likely to achieve positive results.\n"

History of epilepsy, migraines, chronic pancreatitis status post tp/ait.Went to ED for abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that was unremitting for weeks. Had abdominal CT that found incidental liver lesions. Followed up with an MRI with contrast. The below are the findings in my liver. Hpw should I interpret? Is it something to worry about?\"There are multiple (at least 7) arterially enhancing lesions in both lobes of liver, which are hyperintense on T2 and without internal fat. The dominant lesion measures 1.8 cm and seen in segment 6 of the right lobe (29:67). A few other prominent lesions include 6 mm segment 6 (29:47), 8 mm segment 5 (29:40), and 3 mm segment 2 (29:30). No definite washout however the lesions appear to enhance less then background vessels on delayed phases, arguing against hemangioma.Multiple arterially enhancing lesions in both lobes of liver, largest measuring up to 1.8 cm in segment 6 of the right lobe. Imaging features suggest adenoma with the differential including focal nodular hyperplasia.\"",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The MRI findings describe multiple lesions in your liver.  The key features are that they:\n\n* **Enhance arterially:** This means they receive a lot of blood flow from arteries, a characteristic of several liver lesions.\n* **Are hyperintense on T2:** This means they appear bright on certain MRI sequences.\n* **Lack internal fat:** This helps rule out some types of benign lesions.\n* **Show less enhancement than blood vessels on delayed phases:** This argues against hemangiomas (benign blood vessel tumors).\n* **Largest is 1.8 cm:**  Size is important; larger lesions warrant more attention.\n\nThe radiologist's impression strongly suggests **liver adenoma** as the most likely diagnosis, but also mentions **focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)** as a possibility.  Both are generally benign, but they differ slightly in their characteristics and potential risks.  Liver adenomas, while usually benign, have a small chance of developing into liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), especially if they are larger than 5 cm or if you take oral contraceptives (which you do, with Yaz).  FNH is almost always completely benign.\n\n**This is NOT something to dismiss.**  You absolutely need to follow up with your doctor or the gastroenterologist who ordered the MRI.  They will consider your medical history (especially the medications you're taking, including Yaz, which is a risk factor for liver adenoma), the imaging report, and likely order further tests to determine the exact nature of these lesions.  Further evaluation might include:\n\n* **Blood tests:** To check liver function and look for markers of liver damage or cancer.  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a blood test that could help in this situation.\n* **Biopsy:**  A small tissue sample from the lesion might be needed for definitive diagnosis. This is the gold standard for determining the type of lesion.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-interpret or self-treat.** The report suggests a concerning possibility, but further investigation is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management. Your doctor is the best source of information and guidance regarding your specific situation.  Schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as possible.\n"

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your wife's situation is understandably frightening.  It's crucial to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for informational purposes only and should not replace the advice of her neurologist or other treating physicians.\n\n**Key Concerns & Questions for her Doctor:**\n\n* **Post-C-Section Epilepsy:** The doctor's explanation linking the seizures to the spinal anesthesia is a possibility, but it's rare.  Further investigation into the MRI findings (\"some activity in the front part of the brain\") is warranted.  Was this activity specific, or just generalized?  Have they ruled out other potential causes of seizures, even rare ones?\n\n* **New Symptoms:** The new symptoms (light sensitivity, blurry vision, excessive sleepiness, itching, vibrations/shaking) are significant and need immediate attention from her neurologist.  These warrant a thorough evaluation to rule out other neurological conditions.  The doctor reducing her medication dosage without addressing these new symptoms is concerning.  This requires a reassessment.\n\n* **Medication Side Effects:** Phenytoin can cause various side effects, including some of those your wife is experiencing (e.g., drowsiness, nystagmus (eye movement issues that might contribute to blurry vision)).  The itching is less common but can occur.  However, the severity and combination of symptoms needs careful evaluation.\n\n* **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):**  While MS is a possibility given the symptoms, it's not the only explanation.  Many neurological conditions can present similarly.  MS requires specific diagnostic testing.  Don't jump to conclusions based on online research.\n\n* **Seizure Risk:**  Whether she's at risk for further seizures is impossible for me to say.  This is something her neurologist must assess based on all her symptoms, the MRI, EEG (if done), and other investigations.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1. **Immediately Contact her Neurologist:**  Schedule an urgent appointment to discuss all the new symptoms (itching, vibrations, light sensitivity, blurry vision, excessive sleepiness).  Emphasize your concerns and the fact that the dosage reduction hasn't alleviated the symptoms and has possibly introduced new ones.\n2. **Detailed Records:** Keep a detailed record of all her symptoms, including the timing, duration, and severity.  This information will be invaluable for her doctor.\n3. **Further Testing (if not already done):** Ask her doctor about the possibility of additional tests, such as a repeat MRI, EEG (electroencephalogram), or other investigations to explore the cause of her seizures and new symptoms.  Blood tests to rule out other possibilities are also important.\n4. **Don't Adjust Medication:**  Never adjust her medication dosage without consulting her doctor.\n\n\nYour anxiety is understandable, but focusing on getting a comprehensive medical evaluation from her neurologist is the best way to address your concerns and ensure your wife receives the appropriate care.  The combination of symptoms warrants a very thorough investigation.  Do not delay seeking urgent medical attention.\n"

        "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these unusual sensations.  The description you've given \u2013 the tingling shiver, the strange emotional cocktail of dread and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the heightened awareness, and the subsequent dizziness and headache \u2013 doesn't easily fit into a single known medical category.\n\nHowever, several possibilities exist, and it's crucial to consult a doctor to determine the cause.  Here are some potential areas a physician might explore:\n\n* **Migraine Variants:** While you've ruled out typical migraines with visual aura, some migraine variants can present with atypical symptoms like those you describe.  The tingling, dizziness, and emotional changes could be part of a less common migraine presentation.\n\n* **Panic Attacks or Anxiety:**  The combination of dread, hyperawareness, and dizziness aligns with some symptoms of panic attacks. While you haven't mentioned intense fear or shortness of breath, the underlying feeling of unease and the physical sensations could be related.\n\n* **Vestibular Issues:** The dizziness and floatiness strongly suggest a potential issue with your inner ear or vestibular system, responsible for balance.  This could be unrelated to the other sensations or a contributing factor.\n\n* **Neurological Conditions (less likely):** While less probable given the infrequent nature and lack of other symptoms, a neurological consultation might be warranted if these episodes continue or worsen.  Conditions like epilepsy sometimes present with atypical auras.\n\n* **Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction:** Your description hints at potential dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate and blood pressure. This could manifest in unusual sensations and feelings.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **See a doctor:**  This is the most important step.  A thorough medical history, physical exam, and possibly some basic tests (like a neurological exam) can help determine the cause.\n* **Keep a detailed log:** Note the frequency, duration, and specific sensations of each episode. This will be incredibly valuable for your doctor. Include any triggers you can identify (stress, sleep deprivation, specific foods, etc.).\n* **Mention the dizziness:**  The dizziness you experienced this time is a significant symptom and should be discussed with your doctor.\n\nWhile it's tempting to search online for answers, relying on professional medical advice is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.  These sensations warrant a medical evaluation to rule out anything serious and provide you with peace of mind.\n"

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents.

        "answer": "It sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening to have experienced such inconsistent and seemingly inadequate management of your epilepsy.  Let's break down why things might have gone downhill and what steps you can take.\n\n**Why things went downhill:**\n\n* **Incomplete Seizure Characterization:** The most significant issue is the consistent misdiagnosis and underestimation of your myoclonic seizures.  These are often subtle and easily dismissed, especially if the person experiencing them isn't properly educated about what to look for.  The fact that these were not fully recognized and managed contributed significantly to the worsening of your condition.  They are still considered seizures, and their frequency is a significant factor in epilepsy management.\n\n* **Premature Medication Cessation:** Stopping your medication after only three years without *all* seizures was likely premature, especially given the persistent myoclonic activity.  Even though you didn't have major tonic-clonic seizures, the myoclonic seizures were a clear indicator that your epilepsy was not fully controlled.  A period of years without all seizure activity is generally preferred before tapering medication.\n\n* **Inadequate Medication Switching:** The abrupt switch from Keppra to a low dose of Lamotrigine, without a proper tapering and transition period, was a significant error. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) need to be adjusted carefully to avoid withdrawal effects and maintain seizure control.  The low dose of Lamotrigine likely provided insufficient seizure protection.\n\n* **Insufficient Dose Adjustment:** The final dose adjustments (100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra) might still be inadequate for your needs, given the persistence of myoclonic seizures. The Clobazam is likely helping to control the sleep-related seizures.\n\n* **Underlying Mental Health:** Your mental health conditions can significantly impact seizure control and vice-versa.  Stress, anxiety, and sleep deprivation are well-known seizure triggers.  Your intense emotional struggles could have played a part in the worsening of your epilepsy.  This requires a multi-disciplinary approach and the input of a mental health professional.\n\n* **EEG Interpretation:**  While the EEGs show absence of \"frank epileptiform abnormalities\" during periods of relative calm, it's critical to remember EEGs are not always perfect at detecting subtle seizure activity, especially myoclonic seizures which are brief and might not always be picked up on EEG. The description of \"intermittent slowness localized in the bilateral fronto-temporal\" hints at possible underlying brain activity changes related to your seizures, and this needs to be discussed with your neurologist.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Find a New Neurologist:**  This is crucial. You need a neurologist experienced in epilepsy and who will take your symptoms seriously.  Someone who understands the nuances of myoclonic seizures and the complexities of AED management. Look for a specialist in epilepsy rather than a general neurologist if possible.\n\n2. **Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Start keeping a meticulous diary documenting every seizure \u2013 type, duration, frequency, triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, etc.), and any other associated symptoms.  This is invaluable information for your neurologist.\n\n3. **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't hesitate to question your neurologist's recommendations.  If you feel they aren't listening to you or adequately addressing your concerns, seek a second opinion.\n\n4. **Address Mental Health:**  Work with a therapist or psychiatrist to manage your mental health conditions.  This could significantly improve your quality of life and potentially reduce seizure frequency.\n\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:**  Prioritize good sleep hygiene.  Consistent sleep schedules, a relaxing bedtime routine, and a comfortable sleep environment are essential.\n\n6. **Trigger Identification:** Pay close attention to any triggers associated with your seizures (stress, lack of sleep etc.).\n\n7. **Medication Review:**  Your current medication regime needs careful review.  Your neurologist should adjust the doses based on your seizure diary and EEG findings.  They might also need to consider adding or switching medications.\n\n8. **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):**  If medication adjustments aren't enough, discuss other treatment options with your neurologist, like VNS, which is sometimes used in cases of poorly controlled epilepsy.\n\nThis situation is complex, but by being your own advocate, working closely with a competent medical team, and addressing underlying mental health issues, you can significantly improve your epilepsy management and quality of life.  Don't give up hope.\n"

        "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",

        "answer": "It's crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot diagnose medical conditions.  What you're describing is concerning and needs a proper medical evaluation. The fact that you've experienced this multiple times, including an episode severe enough to warrant hospitalization, makes it imperative that you seek specialized medical attention.\n\nWhile I can't diagnose, your description suggests several possibilities that a neurologist would need to investigate:\n\n* **Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Disorder):** This is a condition where neurological symptoms (like numbness, paralysis, or sensory loss) occur without a clear underlying neurological cause.  The symptoms are real and distressing, but they're believed to be related to psychological stress or trauma.  The fact that the numbness is precisely divided down the midline of your body is a feature that's sometimes seen in conversion disorders.  Your other diagnoses (ASD, GAD, MMD, ADHD) could potentially contribute to or exacerbate this.\n\n* **Migraine with Aura:** While you mention headaches, the neurological symptoms (numbness, vision loss, speech difficulties) strongly suggest a migraine with aura.  The aura can precede, accompany, or even replace the headache itself.  The unilateral (one-sided) nature of your symptoms fits this, and the duration is consistent with some migraine experiences.\n\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or other neurological event:** While less likely given the lack of lasting effects, it's important to rule out a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain.  A TIA, often called a \"mini-stroke,\" can cause similar symptoms.  Further investigation is crucial to eliminate this possibility.\n\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  There are many other, rarer neurological conditions that could potentially manifest in this way.  A thorough evaluation will help to explore these possibilities.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Return to your doctor immediately:**  Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician and explain these symptoms in detail.  Emphasize the frequency and severity of the episodes.\n\n2. **Request a referral to a neurologist:** Your primary care physician should refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in the nervous system.  This is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n3. **Keep a detailed journal:**  Document the timing, duration, and specific symptoms of each episode.  Note any potential triggers or preceding events.  This information will be invaluable to your doctor.\n\n4. **Be open and honest with your doctors:**  Discuss your mental health diagnoses, as they may play a role in the evaluation.\n\n\nDo not attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat.  This is a serious issue requiring professional medical attention.  The sooner you seek help, the better the chances of finding a diagnosis and developing a management plan.\n"

I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're worried after receiving a diagnosis of motor tics and ADHD,  being prescribed medication for these conditions, and yet still having concerns about potential epilepsy, especially given the use of clonazepam.  The fact that your EEG was normal is reassuring, suggesting that there isn't readily apparent epileptic activity in your brain.\n\nHowever, the neurologist's assessment is not necessarily definitive. While the EEG is a valuable tool, it doesn't always detect all types of epilepsy, and some types of epilepsy might only show up on an EEG during a seizure.\n\n**Here's why you shouldn't panic but should actively follow up:**\n\n* **Normal EEG doesn't rule out *all* epilepsy:**  A normal EEG doesn't exclude the possibility of epilepsy completely.  There are forms of epilepsy that may not show up on a routine EEG.\n* **Motor tics can mimic seizures:** The involuntary movements you describe could be consistent with both motor tics (as diagnosed) and some forms of epilepsy.  The distinction can be subtle.\n* **Clonazepam's broad use:** Clonazepam is indeed used for myoclonic epilepsy, but it's also a powerful benzodiazepine used to treat various movement disorders and anxiety.  Its presence in your prescription doesn't automatically mean the doctor definitively diagnosed you with epilepsy. It's likely prescribed as a rescue medication for severe episodes.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Have an open and honest conversation with your neurologist:**  Clearly express your concerns and anxieties.  Ask specific questions:\n    * Why was epilepsy not definitively ruled out?\n    * What other tests might be considered if your symptoms persist or worsen?  (e.g., more extensive EEG monitoring, MRI of the brain)\n    * What are the specific criteria that would lead them to reconsider an epilepsy diagnosis?\n    * What are the potential side effects of long-term use of clonazepam, given its use is only for \"emergencies\"?\n2. **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the frequency, duration, and severity of your movements. Note any triggers or patterns you observe. This information will be invaluable for your neurologist.\n3. **Strictly follow your medication regimen:**  Adhere to the prescribed dosages and timing of your medications.  Report any side effects to your neurologist immediately.\n4. **Seek a second opinion if necessary:** If you remain unconvinced or anxious, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist specializing in movement disorders or epilepsy.\n\nIn short, while the initial assessment points towards motor tics and ADHD, the possibility of an underlying neurological condition, even a less common form of epilepsy, cannot be entirely dismissed based on a single EEG.  Open communication with your doctor and meticulous monitoring of your symptoms are crucial. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification and further investigations if needed.\n"

My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the air hunger you're experiencing with Vyvanse.  While it's possible this side effect will lessen with time as your body adjusts, it's crucial to address it now, especially since it's impacting your daily life and singing.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice from your doctor or psychiatrist.  **You must contact your psychiatrist or doctor immediately to discuss this side effect.**  They can assess the severity, determine if it's related to the Vyvanse, and explore options for managing it.\n\nHere's what you should discuss with your doctor:\n\n* **Severity and nature of the air hunger:** Describe the feeling precisely \u2013  is it a constant feeling of shortness of breath, a tightness in your chest, or something else?  Explain how it impacts your daily activities, especially your singing.\n* **Other symptoms:** Note any other side effects you are experiencing, such as increased anxiety, heart palpitations, or changes in blood pressure.  Even seemingly minor symptoms can be relevant.\n* **Medication interactions:** Remind your doctor of all medications you are taking (Zoloft, Lamictal, and the IUD).  Some medications can interact and exacerbate side effects.\n* **Possible alternative treatments:** If the air hunger is severe or persistent, your doctor might suggest adjusting the Vyvanse dosage, switching to a different ADHD medication, or adding another medication to manage the side effects.\n\n**In the meantime, while you wait to contact your doctor:**\n\n* **Stay hydrated:** Dehydration can worsen feelings of shortness of breath. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n* **Practice mindful breathing:** While you already know how to breathe deeply, consciously focusing on your breath can be helpful. Try slow, deep breaths, focusing on the inhale and exhale.\n* **Avoid triggers:** Identify if certain activities or situations seem to worsen the air hunger.  This may help your doctor understand the underlying cause.\n* **Track your symptoms:** Keep a journal noting the severity of the air hunger, when it occurs, and any other symptoms you experience. This will help your doctor assess the situation more effectively.\n\n\nDo not attempt to self-treat this symptom.  The air hunger could be a serious side effect requiring medical intervention.

        "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with a focal seizure, possibly evolving into a more generalized seizure.  The fact that it's happened twice recently, after a long period without incidents, is definitely a reason to seek medical attention, and you've already done the right thing by booking a neurologist appointment.\n\nHere's what you can do in the meantime and what to expect from your neurologist:\n\n**Before your appointment:**\n\n* **Keep a detailed seizure diary:**  Record the date, time, duration, and all the symptoms you experienced during each episode.  Include details like the aura (static, colors, location), loss of vision, nausea, limb coldness, deja vu, speech difficulties, and any other sensations. Note how long each symptom lasted.  This will be invaluable information for your neurologist.\n* **Note any triggers:** Were you doing anything specific before the episodes (stress, lack of sleep, specific foods, flashing lights, etc.)?  Try to identify potential patterns.\n* **Identify your support system:** If possible, have someone with you during your appointment to help you recall details and ask questions.\n* **Gather medical records:** If you have records from your 2020 ER visit, bring those with you.\n\n**At your neurologist appointment:**\n\n* **Be prepared to describe your symptoms clearly and thoroughly:** Use your seizure diary as a reference.\n* **Ask questions:** Don't hesitate to ask your neurologist about the possible causes of your seizures, the diagnostic tests they might recommend (EEG, MRI), treatment options (medication, lifestyle changes), and what to do if you have another episode.\n* **Discuss your concerns:**  Express your worries about the recurrence and the potential for future seizures.\n\n**What your neurologist might do:**\n\n* **Conduct a neurological exam:** This will assess your reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n* **Order diagnostic tests:**  An EEG (electroencephalogram) is likely to be recommended to measure brainwave activity and identify any abnormalities.  An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) might be ordered to rule out structural problems in the brain.\n* **Discuss potential diagnoses:** Based on the tests and your symptoms, your neurologist might diagnose focal seizures, possibly with secondary generalization (meaning the seizure spreads from a localized area to involve the whole brain).  Other possibilities will also be considered.\n* **Recommend treatment:**  This could include anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), lifestyle modifications (such as managing stress and getting enough sleep), or a combination of both.\n\n**Important Note:**  While waiting for your appointment, if you experience another seizure, seek immediate medical attention.  It's best to go to the emergency room.\n\nRemember, you're taking proactive steps by seeking medical advice.

I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a complex situation requiring professional medical evaluation.  While you've provided a detailed history, online resources cannot diagnose medical conditions.  Your symptoms suggest a possible interplay of several factors, and it's crucial to have a thorough investigation.\n\nHere's why you need to see a doctor, and what specialists might be involved:\n\n* **Neurological Evaluation:** The episodes of unclear speech, depersonalization, trembling, ptosis, blurry vision, and potential non-epileptic seizures (PNES) require a neurological assessment.  An EEG (electroencephalogram) might be necessary to rule out epilepsy.  A neurologist can also investigate the possibility of other neurological conditions.\n\n* **Gastrointestinal Evaluation:** The correlation between your symptoms and bowel movements, along with food intolerances, suggests a possible gastrointestinal component.  A gastroenterologist can investigate potential food allergies or intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or other gastrointestinal issues.  They might recommend food elimination diaries or further testing.\n\n* **Psychiatric Evaluation:** The anxiety, panic attacks, and depersonalization warrant a consultation with a psychiatrist or psychologist.  They can assess for anxiety disorders, potential underlying trauma, and provide therapy or medication to manage these symptoms.\n\n* **Possible Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction:**  Some of your symptoms, such as restricted circulation, trembling, and changes in sensory perception, could point towards a problem with your autonomic nervous system (ANS). This system controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.  Further investigation by a neurologist or specialist in ANS disorders might be needed.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Food Intolerance vs. Allergy:**  Clearly defining your food intolerances is crucial.  Keep a detailed food diary to track triggers and symptoms.  Allergy testing may be necessary to distinguish between intolerances and true allergies.\n\n* **Medication Interactions:**  It's important to disclose all medications and supplements you're taking to your doctor to rule out any potential interactions or side effects.\n\n* **Differential Diagnosis:** Your symptoms could be related to several conditions, and it's unlikely a single diagnosis will fully explain everything.  A team approach involving multiple specialists is likely needed.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician (PCP).**  This is the best starting point for coordinating further specialist referrals.\n2. **Keep a detailed journal:** Record the timing and severity of all symptoms, foods consumed, bowel movements, and any other relevant information. This will be invaluable for your doctors.\n3. **Be open and honest:**  Provide your doctors with a complete history of your symptoms, including the episodes from age 7.\n\nDelaying medical attention could hinder proper diagnosis and treatment.  Your symptoms warrant prompt and thorough investigation by medical professionals.\n"

        "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The feelings of fogginess and being \"almost drunk\" you're experiencing while on Keppra are important concerns that need to be addressed by your doctor or neurologist.  While some level of side effects is possible with Keppra,  the severity and impact on your daily life need professional evaluation.\n\n**Do not adjust your medication dosage or timing without first consulting your doctor.**  Changing the dosage or timing on your own could be harmful.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n* **Schedule an appointment with your neurologist or doctor as soon as possible.**  Explain the symptoms clearly and thoroughly.  Mention the timing of when you take the medication and if you've noticed any patterns related to the time of day.  Be prepared to discuss the frequency and intensity of the fogginess.\n* **Keep a detailed record of your symptoms.** Note the time of day you experience the fogginess, how long it lasts, and the severity. This will be helpful information for your doctor.\n* **Ask your doctor about the best time to take Keppra.** The optimal time of day can vary depending on individual responses, and they can advise on whether taking it with food might help.\n\n**Possible reasons for your symptoms (this is NOT a diagnosis, only possibilities):**\n\n* **Dosage:** Even at a reduced dose, Keppra can still cause side effects. Your doctor may need to adjust the dosage further or consider alternative medications.\n* **Timing:**  The time of day you take Keppra *could* impact your experience of side effects. Some people find taking it at bedtime minimizes daytime drowsiness.\n* **Individual sensitivity:** Some people are simply more sensitive to the side effects of Keppra than others.\n* **Other factors:**  While you've mentioned only Motrin, it's always best to inform your doctor of *all* medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.\n\nYour doctor is the best resource for managing your epilepsy and its treatment.  Don't hesitate to contact them immediately with your concerns.  They can assess your situation, make appropriate adjustments, or explore alternative treatment options if necessary.\n"

        "question": "Age - 30   Sex - male    Height - 5'8\"-174 cm    Weight - 60 kgs.    Duration of complaint - 3 years    Location - Soft palate    Any existing relevant medical issues - Subjective Tinnitus caused by olanzapine and an MRI scan   Current medications - Cinolazepam for sleep, Mysoline for the myoclonus. Is palatal myoclonus treatable?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Palatal myoclonus, the involuntary twitching of the soft palate, is often difficult to treat, but it's not necessarily untreatable.  The success of treatment depends heavily on the underlying cause.  In your case, the three-year duration and association with Mysoline (primidone) suggests a likely neurological origin, possibly related to the underlying myoclonus itself or potentially exacerbated by the olanzapine.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why treatment is complex and what options might be considered:\n\n* **Idiopathic vs. Secondary:**  Palatal myoclonus can be idiopathic (unknown cause) or secondary to another condition.  Your case seems more likely to be secondary, given your myoclonus and medication history.  Identifying the root cause is crucial for effective treatment.\n\n* **Treatment Approaches:**  There isn't a single \"cure\" for palatal myoclonus. Treatments focus on managing the symptoms:\n\n    * **Addressing the underlying cause:**  If the myoclonus is significantly improved with Mysoline, this suggests a direct relationship.  Optimizing your myoclonus treatment is paramount.  Your neurologist should review your Mysoline dose and consider other potential anti-myoclonic medications if needed.  They might also want to explore if the olanzapine is still necessary, as it's associated with the tinnitus, a side effect that could be managed differently.\n\n    * **Symptomatic Treatment:**  If the myoclonus is well-managed but the palatal myoclonus persists, there are limited options.  Sometimes, medications like baclofen or clonazepam (which you're already taking for sleep) can help *slightly* reduce the severity.  However, these usually aren't very effective on their own.\n\n    * **Botulinum Toxin Injections:**  Injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the affected muscles can temporarily weaken the muscles and reduce the twitching.  This is often a minimally invasive option, but the effects are not permanent and need repeat injections.\n\n    * **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**  This is a highly invasive surgical procedure reserved for cases that are severely debilitating and unresponsive to other treatments.  It's generally not considered for palatal myoclonus unless it significantly impacts quality of life.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Consult your neurologist:** This is paramount.  Discuss your palatal myoclonus with them in detail.  They can assess the situation, review your medications, and explore options for managing both your myoclonus and the palatal myoclonus.\n* **Be honest and thorough:** Provide your neurologist with a complete medical history, including all medications, symptoms, and any changes you've noticed.\n* **Ask questions:** Don't hesitate to ask your neurologist about the potential risks and benefits of each treatment option.\n\nIn summary, while palatal myoclonus can be challenging to treat, focusing on managing the underlying myoclonus and exploring options like botulinum toxin injections could offer some relief.  A thorough discussion with your neurologist is the crucial first step.\n"

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

        "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're worried after undergoing so many CT scans and a PET scan.  The sheer number of scans, coupled with the serious health issues you were experiencing, is understandably alarming.  Let's address your concerns about radiation exposure and cancer risk.\n\n**Understanding Your Radiation Exposure:**\n\nThe primary concern with repeated CT scans is the cumulative dose of ionizing radiation.  The DLP (Dose Length Product) is a measure of the radiation dose you received.  While the values you provided are significant, it's impossible to give a precise risk assessment without knowing your weight and other factors that influence radiation absorption.  However, we can put things into perspective:\n\n* **Your Total DLP:**  Summing up your DLPs from the provided CT scans (excluding the PET, which has a different type of radiation), gives a substantial dose. A more precise numerical assessment of the total radiation exposure is beyond the scope of this response.  However, it exceeds a considerable amount more than what most people experience in their lifetime.\n\n* **Comparison to Other Groups:**  Direct comparisons to radiation workers, radiation therapy patients, pilots, or survivors of accidental radiation exposure are difficult because the exposure patterns and types of radiation differ significantly.  Radiation workers, for instance, often have more controlled exposures (with safety measures) and may experience lower doses but over many years. Radiation therapy patients receive highly focused radiation for cancer treatment, and thus the type of radiation, the dose, and the location of the dose are substantially different.  Pilots are exposed to cosmic radiation, which is a different type of radiation than what's used in CT scans.  Survivors of radiation accidents have highly variable exposures.\n\n* **The Role of the Contrast:** The use of contrast medium (Iohexol) in your scan on November 15th doesn't directly increase your radiation risk, but it's a factor considered in medical risk assessments.\n\n* **The PET Scan:** PET scans involve a different type of radiation (from the radioactive tracer) than CT scans. While the DLP isn't available for your PET scan, its impact needs to be added to your overall radiation exposure.\n\n**Assessing Cancer Risk:**\n\nThe increased risk of cancer from the radiation you received is real, although difficult to quantify precisely. Several factors influence this risk:\n\n* **Age:**  Your age (32) is important, as younger individuals are generally more susceptible to radiation-induced cancers.\n* **Dose:** The total dose received is the most significant factor.\n* **Type of radiation:**  Different types of radiation have different effects.\n* **Individual susceptibility:**  Genetic factors influence how susceptible an individual is to radiation-induced cancers.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n* **Discuss with your doctor:** Your medical team is the best resource to assess your specific risk. They can factor in your health history, the details of your scans, and the context of your illness. They can also discuss whether any monitoring is recommended.\n* **Focus on preventive health:**  Maintain a healthy lifestyle through diet, exercise, and stress management. This is important regardless of radiation exposure.\n\n**Reassurance:**\n\nIt's normal to feel anxious about this.  However, it's crucial to remember that many people undergo multiple CT scans without developing cancer. The risk is increased, not guaranteed.  The benefits of the diagnostic imaging in your case were vital to trying to figure out a life-threatening condition.  A small increase in lifetime cancer risk is a less concerning outcome, for most people, than the serious illnesses you may have had if not for the diagnostics and treatment.\n\nFocusing on your health moving forward is key.  Please don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional if you're struggling to manage the anxiety surrounding this issue.  They can provide additional support and coping mechanisms.\n"

        "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Let's break down the vagus nerve and its purported benefits.  It's understandable you're skeptical given the hype \u2013 many health claims lack robust scientific backing.\n\n**What is the Vagus Nerve?**\n\nThe vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve in your body.  \"Vagus\" means \"wandering\" in Latin, reflecting its extensive reach.  It originates in the brainstem and branches out to various organs in your chest and abdomen, including:\n\n* **Heart:** Influences heart rate and blood pressure.\n* **Lungs:** Affects breathing rate.\n* **Digestive system:**  Plays a crucial role in gut motility and secretions (digestion).\n* **Immune system:**  Connects the brain to the immune system.\n\nEssentially, it's a major component of the parasympathetic nervous system, often referred to as the \"rest-and-digest\" system.  Its function is to slow things down, counteracting the \"fight-or-flight\" response of the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n**What Does it Actually Do?**\n\nThe vagus nerve's primary function is bidirectional communication between the brain and the body.  It sends signals *from* the brain to various organs to regulate their functions and also transmits sensory information *from* the organs *back* to the brain.  This feedback loop is crucial for maintaining homeostasis (internal balance).\n\n**Does Stimulating it Have the Claimed Effects?**\n\nThe claims surrounding vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) are complex and require nuance:\n\n* **Digestion:**  VNS *does* influence gut motility and gastric secretions.  However, whether stimulating it directly improves digestion in a clinically significant way for most people is less clear.  Many factors affect digestion.\n* **Lowering Blood Pressure:**  Some studies show VNS can help lower blood pressure, particularly in people with specific conditions.  It's not a guaranteed solution for everyone.\n* **Helping Anxiety:**  This is an area of active research.  While some studies suggest VNS can reduce anxiety symptoms, the evidence is still developing, and it's not a first-line treatment for most anxiety disorders.  The effect likely stems from its impact on the parasympathetic nervous system.\n* **Other Claimed Benefits:**  Many other benefits are touted (e.g., improved mood, reduced inflammation), but the evidence base is often weaker or limited to specific populations or conditions.\n\n**Is Stimulating the Vagus Nerve \"Bullshit\"?**\n\nNo, it's not entirely \"bullshit,\" but it's crucial to be realistic about its capabilities.  VNS is *not* a miracle cure-all.  While it plays a vital role in bodily functions,  the hype often oversells its benefits.\n\n**Types of Vagus Nerve Stimulation:**\n\n* **Medical VNS:** This involves surgically implanted devices used to treat specific conditions like epilepsy and depression that haven't responded to other treatments. This is a serious medical procedure with potential side effects.\n* **Non-invasive VNS:** This includes techniques like:\n    * **Deep breathing exercises:**  These can activate the vagus nerve.\n    * **Singing:** The act of singing has been linked to vagal nerve stimulation.\n    * **Cold water exposure:** Immersing your face in cold water is sometimes suggested.\n    * **Massage:** Gentle massage of the neck area can potentially stimulate the vagus nerve.\n\nThe effectiveness of these non-invasive methods varies greatly depending on the individual and the technique. The scientific evidence supporting many of them is still limited.\n\n\n**Your Specific Situation (35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada):**\n\nSince you're taking sertraline (an antidepressant), it's particularly important to discuss any interest in VNS with your doctor.  Some methods of VNS might interact with your medication, and your doctor can guide you on safe and appropriate approaches.  They can also help you understand if VNS is relevant to any of your health concerns.\n\n**In short:** The vagus nerve is important, but stimulating it isn't a magic bullet.  Be wary of exaggerated claims and prioritize evidence-based approaches. Consult your doctor before trying any vagus nerve stimulation techniques, especially if you are on medication.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible to have epilepsy without experiencing photosensitivity (sensitivity to flashing lights).  While photosensitivity is a symptom *associated* with some types of epilepsy, it's not a defining characteristic of the condition.  Many people with epilepsy don't have photosensitivity.\n\nThe fact that your mother, with limited English proficiency, used the term \"epilepsy\" doesn't necessarily mean the diagnosis was inaccurate.  She may have been using the term as a general descriptor for the seizures, even if the specific type wasn't precisely identified.\n\nThe description of seizures occurring roughly once per blood moon (\"about once every blood moon\") is unusual.  Seizures generally follow a more regular pattern or are triggered by specific factors, not lunar cycles.  This raises questions about the accuracy of the initial diagnosis or the frequency of the seizures.\n\nThe claim that the condition \"goes away when you're 13\" is also something that warrants further investigation.  While some childhood epilepsy syndromes do improve or resolve during adolescence, it's not typical for a doctor to make such a definitive statement without ongoing monitoring.\n\n**In short:** You need a proper neurological evaluation to clarify the diagnosis.  The information you've provided raises significant questions about the accuracy and completeness of your previous diagnosis.  You should consult a neurologist or epileptologist to obtain a clear and current diagnosis. They can conduct tests (EEG, MRI) to determine if you have epilepsy, the type if you do, and what treatment (if any) might be necessary.\n"

The information below is for general knowledge only and does not constitute medical diagnosis or treatment.  **You must discuss your MRI results and symptoms with your doctor.**  They are the only ones who can properly interpret your imaging and assess your condition.\n\nBased on your description, it sounds like you're concerned about the possibility of radiation necrosis following your Gamma Knife treatments.  Let's address your questions point-by-point:\n\n* **Does radiation necrosis heal?** Radiation necrosis is damage to brain tissue caused by radiation therapy.  It *can* heal, but it often progresses slowly and may not fully resolve.  The extent of healing depends on factors such as the amount of radiation received, the location of the damage, and the individual's response.  Some individuals experience significant improvement, while others have persistent symptoms.\n\n* **Is it dangerous?** Radiation necrosis can be dangerous, as it can lead to neurological deficits, seizures, and even life-threatening complications depending on its severity and location.\n\n* **Could this just be swelling?**  It's possible. Swelling (edema) in the brain is a common occurrence after radiation and can mimic some of the symptoms of radiation necrosis.  An MRI can help distinguish between them, but it requires expert interpretation by a radiologist or neurologist.\n\n* **Did it progress fast from January 2022 - April 2023?**  Without seeing your MRI reports from both time points, it's impossible to say.  The progression of radiation necrosis can be gradual, making it difficult to notice significant changes in short periods.\n\n* **Since I'm not getting blood flow there, is it basically the same thing as an ischemic stroke?** Not necessarily.  While both radiation necrosis and ischemic stroke involve a lack of proper blood flow and subsequent tissue damage, the *cause* is different.  Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage of a blood vessel, while radiation necrosis is caused by damage from radiation.\n\n* **What is FLAIR hyperintensity?** FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is a type of MRI sequence.  Hyperintensity on FLAIR means that an area of the brain appears brighter than normal.  This often indicates the presence of edema (swelling), inflammation, or other abnormalities, which could be associated with radiation necrosis.\n\n**Why you need to talk to your doctor immediately:**\n\nYou have several concerning symptoms (vision changes, neurological symptoms, EEG slowing) that require medical attention.  Your doctor can:\n\n* Review your MRI reports in detail and correlate them with your symptoms and medical history.\n* Determine if the changes seen on your MRI are consistent with radiation necrosis, edema, or another condition.\n* Assess the severity of any damage.\n* Discuss treatment options, which might include medication to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.\n\nDo not rely on online searches for medical diagnoses.  Schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your concerns and get a proper evaluation.  The delay until June seems too long given your symptoms.  Consider contacting their office to see if they can expedite an appointment, or consult a neurologist sooner.\n"

This requires a thorough reevaluation by his neurologist.\n\n* **Prodromal Headache:** The severe headache preceding the seizures is a potential *aura*, a warning sign that a seizure is imminent.  Identifying and understanding auras can be crucial in seizure management.  This needs to be discussed with the neurologist.\n\n* **Calcification:** While the neurologist indicated the calcification is unchanged and \"normal,\" this warrants further discussion.  Context is crucial: what type of calcification is it?  Is its location relevant to seizure activity?  The neurologist needs to explain this fully.\n\n* **Treatment Options:**  Simply increasing medication dosage without exploring other options (like changes in medication type, additional therapies, or diagnostic testing) may not be the most effective long-term strategy.  Your husband's neurologist needs to consider a more comprehensive approach.\n\n* **Surgical Options (Given History):**  Given that your husband had a hemispherectomy 15 years ago, surgical options might be more limited than for someone without prior brain surgery.  However, new developments in epilepsy surgery should be considered.\n\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your husband's neurologist:**  This is paramount.  Bring a detailed record of the seizure events, including the timing of headaches and the duration of seizures and post-ictal states.\n\n2. **Ask specific questions:**  Prepare questions for the neurologist such as:\n    * \"What could be causing the increased seizure frequency?\"\n    * \"Are there additional diagnostic tests that should be performed (e.g., EEG, MRI, PET scan)?\"\n    * \"Can the prodromal headache be better managed?\"\n    * \"Are there alternative medications or treatment options to consider, such as Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) or other neuromodulation therapies?\"\n    * \"Given the hemispherectomy, what surgical options, if any, might be appropriate?\"\n    * \"What is the significance of the calcification, and could it be contributing to the seizures?\"\n\n3. **Keep a Seizure Diary:**  Maintain a detailed record of each seizure, noting the time, duration, symptoms, and any preceding events like headaches.  This will be invaluable information for the neurologist.\n\n4. **Seek Support:**  Living with someone who has epilepsy can be stressful.  Consider support groups or counseling to help you cope with the emotional challenges.  The Epilepsy Foundation is a great resource for finding support.\n\n\nRemember, you're not alone.  Many people live with epilepsy and find ways to manage it effectively.  By working closely with your husband's neurologist and actively participating in his care, you can significantly improve his quality of life.\n"

        "answer": "It sounds incredibly frustrating and painful to experience such frequent and widespread muscle spasms and cramps.  Your description points to a problem that's beyond simple muscle fatigue or occasional cramps.  Given the frequency, location, and intensity, several possibilities warrant consideration, and **it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor immediately**.  Don't delay \u2013 this needs professional medical evaluation.\n\nHere are some potential areas your doctor might explore:\n\n* **Medication Side Effects:**  The combination of medications you're taking (oral contraceptives, Trintellix, Vyvanse, Keppra, and Ranitidine) is quite extensive. Several of these medications *can* list muscle spasms or cramps as potential side effects, either individually or in combination.  Your doctor needs to review this carefully and consider adjusting dosages or exploring alternative medications.  This is arguably the *most important* avenue to investigate.\n\n* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Muscle cramps are often linked to imbalances in electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sodium.  Your doctor can order blood tests to check your electrolyte levels.  Dehydration can also exacerbate electrolyte imbalances.\n\n* **Underlying Neurological Conditions:**  While you mention epilepsy, other neurological conditions can cause muscle spasms.  Your doctor may consider further neurological evaluations to rule out anything else.\n\n* **Hypothyroidism or other Endocrine Issues:**  Thyroid problems can sometimes manifest as muscle cramps and weakness.  Testing for thyroid function might be beneficial.\n\n* **Fibromyalgia:** This condition involves widespread musculoskeletal pain and often includes muscle spasms and tenderness.\n\n* **Other Rare Conditions:** While less likely, some rare neuromuscular disorders can cause widespread, spontaneous muscle contractions.\n\n\n**What to tell your doctor:**\n\n* **Detailed description of the cramps:**  Include their frequency, duration, location, intensity (on a scale of 1-10), and any triggering factors you've noticed (even if they seem minor).\n* **Complete medication list:**  Make sure they have a comprehensive list of *all* medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n* **Family history:**  Any family history of neuromuscular disorders or muscle problems should be mentioned.\n* **Lifestyle factors:**  Discuss your diet, activity level (even if you think it's minimal), stress levels, and sleep quality.\n\n**Important Note:**  I am an AI and cannot diagnose medical conditions.

        "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to say definitively whether your episodes are related to your epilepsy, anxiety, or a combination of both.  The symptoms you describe \u2013 the feeling of impending doom, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, overwhelming fear, panic attack, heart palpitations, hyperventilation, confusion afterward, and sleep disruption \u2013 overlap significantly with both anxiety disorders and certain types of seizures.  The fact that you experienced multiple episodes in a single day is particularly concerning and warrants immediate medical attention.\n\n**The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, feeling of an impending attack, and post-episode confusion are particularly suggestive of a seizure disorder, even if you haven't had a classic convulsive seizure in two years.**  Epilepsy can manifest in many ways, and these are potential non-convulsive seizure symptoms.  The fact that these are happening *while you are asleep* is also significant.\n\n**However, the frequency, intensity, and association with panic attacks strongly suggest a role for anxiety.**  Anxiety disorders and epilepsy can coexist and exacerbate each other.  The anxiety about having another episode can create a vicious cycle, increasing the likelihood of panic attacks and potentially triggering additional episodes, whether they are seizures or anxiety-related.\n\n**You absolutely need to contact your neurologist or a doctor immediately.**  This increase in frequency is a critical change, and they need to assess your situation.  Several things could be happening:\n\n* **Your medication may not be adequately controlling your epilepsy:** Your dosage might need adjustment, or you might need a different medication altogether.\n* **You may be experiencing a different type of seizure:** The episodes might represent a different seizure type than you experienced before.\n* **You may have an anxiety disorder that is being exacerbated by the fear of seizures:**  Addressing the anxiety could significantly improve your overall condition.\n* **A combination of the above:**  Both epilepsy and anxiety could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat.**  Waiting could be detrimental to your health and well-being.  Schedule an appointment with your doctor or neurologist as soon as possible.  In the meantime, try to practice relaxation techniques (deep breathing, mindfulness) to manage anxiety, but understand that this is not a replacement for professional medical evaluation and treatment.  If you experience another episode, try to have someone present who can observe and note the details of what happens.  This information will be helpful to your doctor.\n"

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated by the delay in diagnosis and seeking answers.  Your research into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and your recollection of past experiences certainly raise the possibility.  Many of the symptoms you describe are consistent with TLE.\n\nLet's break down your concerns:\n\n* **Symptoms aligning with TLE:** The aura you describe before seizures (feeling like you'll throw up), the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences, the unusual auditory sensitivity (sounds seeming aggressive and urgent), the feeling of distorted perception (ceiling far away, hands bigger), unusual breakdowns as a child, and frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu sensations \u2013 all these are strongly suggestive of TLE.  The abnormal EEG activity in your left temporal lobe further supports this suspicion.\n\n* **Tonsillectomy and Mononucleosis:** The timing of your tonsillectomy relative to your first seizure is interesting. While there's no direct causal link established between tonsillectomy and epilepsy, some studies suggest a possible, albeit weak, association in certain cases.  Infections like mononucleosis can sometimes trigger neurological issues, though this is not consistently observed.  It's important for the neurologist to consider this in your overall medical history.\n\n* **Delayed Diagnosis:**  The delay in diagnosis is frustrating but unfortunately common in epilepsy.  Finding the right specialist and undergoing the necessary tests can take time.  The fact that your initial neurologist referred you suggests they felt they lacked the expertise to handle a complex epilepsy case.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Be patient but persistent:** Continue working with the new neurologist.  Provide them with *all* the information you've gathered, including your detailed descriptions of symptoms, your research, and all medical records.\n* **Keep a detailed seizure diary:**  Record the date, time, duration, and any pre-ictal (before the seizure) or post-ictal (after the seizure) symptoms you experience.  This is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.  Note any triggers you might suspect.\n* **Advocate for yourself:** Don't hesitate to ask questions and express your concerns to the neurologist.  If you feel you're not making progress, consider seeking a second opinion from another epilepsy specialist.\n* **Consider a neuropsychological evaluation:** This type of testing can help assess cognitive function and identify subtle cognitive changes sometimes associated with TLE.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only.  The information you've provided strongly suggests the possibility of TLE, but a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified neurologist specializing in epilepsy after a thorough evaluation.  They will likely order further tests, potentially including a more detailed MRI or other specialized EEG studies.  Continue to work with your medical team to receive the proper diagnosis and treatment.\n"

        "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Elevated eosinophil levels (eosinophilia) with no obvious parasitic infection can be caused by a variety of conditions.  Your neurologist's suggestion of a \"body fighting a parasite without a parasite\" is a simplification; it means the body's immune system is exhibiting a response *similar* to a parasitic infection, but the trigger is something else.  Since your level is significantly elevated (22% is very high), it's important to find the underlying cause.\n\nSeveral possibilities exist, some more likely than others given your information:\n\n* **Allergic reactions:** While you say you have no known allergies, some allergic reactions (e.g., to medications, food, or environmental factors) can manifest as eosinophilia, even without classic allergy symptoms like hives or rash.  Your medications, especially Topamax, are known to have side effects, and an unusual reaction resulting in eosinophilia is possible.  This is a relatively common cause.\n\n* **Drug reactions:**  This is strongly suspected given your medication list. Many medications, including some anticonvulsants like Topamax, can cause drug-induced eosinophilia. This is a serious possibility and should be investigated thoroughly by your hematologist.\n\n* **Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES):** These are rare disorders characterized by persistently elevated eosinophil counts in the absence of a known cause. They can cause organ damage if left untreated.  The fact you have no obvious symptoms makes this less likely, but still something the hematologist will consider.\n\n* **Autoimmune diseases:**  Some autoimmune conditions can present with eosinophilia. This is a broader possibility.\n\n* **Connective tissue diseases:** Similar to autoimmune diseases, these can sometimes trigger eosinophilia.\n\n* **Certain cancers:** Although less likely given your symptoms and age, some cancers can be associated with eosinophilia.\n\n\n**It's crucial to emphasize that I am not a medical professional, and this information is not a diagnosis.**  The significant elevation in your eosinophil count warrants a thorough investigation by your hematologist.  They will likely conduct further blood tests, possibly including allergy testing and more specialized bloodwork, to pinpoint the cause.\n\n**When you see your hematologist in June, be sure to:**\n\n* **Provide a complete list of all medications:** Include dosages and how long you've been taking each.\n* **Discuss all symptoms:** Even seemingly unrelated symptoms could be important clues.  The tingling, dizziness, sleep disturbances, and appetite loss could be relevant, especially in the context of eosinophilia.\n* **Inquire about possible testing:**  Ask what tests they plan to conduct to investigate the eosinophilia.\n\nHaving your detailed medical history and conducting appropriate tests will allow the hematologist to make a proper diagnosis and recommend the best course of action.  Don't hesitate to ask questions and express your concerns.  The elevated eosinophil count needs to be investigated to rule out more serious conditions and treat the underlying cause.\n"

        "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're curious about these \"flashes\" you experience.  While it's impossible for me to diagnose you, your description doesn't perfectly align with typical epilepsy symptoms.  Epileptic seizures usually involve more significant neurological changes, such as loss of consciousness, convulsions, or repetitive movements, and are generally more frequent than what you describe.  Your experience seems more akin to a sensory phenomenon triggered by specific mental processes.\n\nHowever, your description does raise some important points:\n\n* **The intensity:** The fact that the intensity varied, especially the episode at the grocery store, is noteworthy.  It suggests something is triggering a neurological response, although the exact nature is unclear.\n\n* **The trigger:** The consistent association with memories of the past, particularly related to visual stimuli (murals, stickers), is a key piece of information. This suggests a possible link between memory retrieval, visual processing, and the sensory disturbance.\n\n* **The sensory component:** The ringing in your ears (tinnitus) and the feeling of being \"out of it\" point towards a potential neurological event, even if brief.\n\nGiven your doctor's reluctance to investigate, I strongly recommend seeking a second opinion from a neurologist.  While your symptoms haven't significantly impacted your daily life, it's still important to understand the underlying cause.  A neurologist can perform a thorough neurological exam and potentially order tests like an EEG (electroencephalogram) to rule out any neurological conditions, including less common forms of epilepsy or other possible explanations.\n\nYour description points towards a possible connection between memory recall, sensory processing, and a neurological event.  A specialist can help determine if there is an underlying medical cause or if this is an unusual but benign phenomenon.

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're worried about the potential effects of a stun gun on your past history of epilepsy, even if it was many years ago.  However, it's highly unlikely that a single stun gun exposure would trigger a return of your epilepsy.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Remission:**  The fact that you haven't had a seizure in over 20 years suggests your epilepsy was likely resolved.  Many childhood epilepsies are self-limiting.\n* **Cause of Epilepsy:** Your epilepsy was caused by a head injury.  A stun gun delivers an electrical shock, but it's a very different type of trauma and doesn't directly affect the brain in the same way as a physical impact.  The mechanism of seizure induction is different.\n* **No Evidence of Link:** There's no established medical evidence linking stun gun exposure to the onset or recurrence of epilepsy in individuals who have been seizure-free for a significant period.\n\n**That said, it's crucial to:**\n\n* **Inform the testing personnel:**  Disclose your history of childhood epilepsy to the people administering the stun gun test. This is essential for your safety and allows them to take appropriate precautions or consider alternatives if necessary.  They may have protocols for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n* **Consult your doctor:**  Before undergoing the test, discuss your concerns with your physician or a neurologist. They can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and the specifics of the test. They can also address any anxieties you have.\n\nWhile the risk is likely low, open communication with medical professionals and the testing personnel is the best way to ensure your safety and peace of mind.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're seeking more information about the potential connections between your Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and cysts, given your history of chronic inflammation.  It's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for informational purposes only and should not replace discussions with your doctors.  You should thoroughly discuss all of your concerns and questions with your medical team.\n\n\n**1. Inflammation and Epilepsy:**\n\nThere's a growing body of research suggesting a link between inflammation and epilepsy.  While not all epilepsy is caused by inflammation,  inflammation can play a significant role in:\n\n* **Triggering seizures:**  Inflammation in the brain (neuroinflammation) can alter the excitability of neurons, making them more likely to fire abnormally and trigger seizures.  This can happen in various ways, including:\n    * **Direct effects on neurons:** Inflammatory molecules can damage neurons or disrupt their normal function.\n    * **Changes in the blood-brain barrier:**  Inflammation can weaken the blood-brain barrier, allowing substances that normally wouldn't cross into the brain to enter and contribute to seizure activity.\n    * **Glial cell activation:** Glial cells, which support neurons, become activated during inflammation and can contribute to neuronal excitability.\n\n* **Epileptogenesis:** This refers to the process by which a normal brain becomes epileptic.  Chronic inflammation is thought to contribute to epileptogenesis by creating an environment conducive to seizure development.\n\n* **Specific types of epilepsy:** Certain types of epilepsy, like autoimmune encephalitis, are directly caused by inflammation and immune system dysfunction.\n\n\n**Your Case:**  Given your Crohn's disease, a known inflammatory condition, it's plausible that systemic inflammation could be contributing to your epilepsy.  However,  establishing a direct causal link requires further investigation by your doctors. They might consider:\n\n* **Neurological imaging:**  MRI or EEG scans to assess for signs of inflammation or other abnormalities in your brain.\n* **Inflammatory markers:** Blood tests to measure levels of inflammatory markers.\n* **Autoimmune testing:** To rule out autoimmune conditions that could be impacting both your epilepsy and Crohn's disease.\n\n**2. Cysts and Inflammation:**\n\nThe connection between your cysts and inflammation is less direct but still possible.  Inflammation can contribute to cyst formation in several ways:\n\n* **Chronic inflammation leading to tissue damage:**  The ongoing inflammatory response can damage tissues, leading to the formation of cysts as the body attempts to repair the damaged area.\n* **Immune system dysfunction:**  Your body's immune system plays a critical role in inflammation and tissue repair.  Problems with the immune system, often associated with chronic inflammation, could contribute to cyst formation.\n* **Specific types of cysts:**  Some types of cysts are directly associated with inflammatory conditions.  The location and type of cysts you have will help determine the potential connection to inflammation.\n\nTo understand the nature of your cysts and their potential link to inflammation, your doctors will need to:\n\n* **Determine the location and type of cysts:** Imaging studies (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI) are essential to identify the type and location of your cysts.\n* **Assess for associated symptoms:**  The symptoms associated with the cysts can provide clues to their underlying cause.\n* **Consider further investigations:** Depending on the type and location of your cysts, further investigations may be necessary, which could include biopsy in some instances.\n\n\n**In summary:**  The interplay between inflammation, epilepsy, and cyst formation is complex.  Your medical team is best equipped to investigate the potential connections in your specific case.  Keep detailed records of your symptoms, and actively participate in your care by asking questions and seeking clarification on any concerns you have.  Don't hesitate to seek second opinions if you feel it's necessary.\n"

        "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable you're concerned and frustrated after two years of symptoms and multiple tests with unclear results.  Let's break down your situation:\n\n* **SELENICA-R 40% (Sodium Valproate):** This is an anticonvulsant medication, primarily used for epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  While it can sometimes have off-label uses to treat other neurological conditions, its use in your case without a clear diagnosis of epilepsy or a related neurological disorder is concerning.  The fact that you're experiencing dizziness, motor issues, and speech problems *could* be indicative of a neurological condition *requiring a different treatment*, but it's not the standard treatment for those symptoms alone.  Sodium valproate also has significant side effects, some of which could mimic or worsen your existing symptoms.  **You should absolutely discuss the rationale behind this prescription with your doctor.**  Ask specifically *why* they believe this is the appropriate medication given your symptoms and the results of your previous tests.\n\n* **Your Symptoms:** Your symptoms (dizziness, motor problems, speech issues) are quite complex and could point towards several potential underlying causes.  A pinched nerve or bulging disc could explain some of the motor and pain issues, but not necessarily the dizziness or speech problems. Other possibilities, which your doctor should consider, include:\n\n    * **Vestibular disorders:** Problems with the inner ear responsible for balance.\n    * **Cerebellar issues:** Problems with the cerebellum, a part of the brain that coordinates movement.\n    * **Multiple sclerosis (MS):** A chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system.\n    * **Other neurological conditions:**  There's a range of less common possibilities.\n\n* **Next Steps:** Your plan to see a doctor to investigate a pinched nerve or bulging disc is a good one, but it should be done *in conjunction with* a thorough neurological evaluation.  You need a neurologist (or a doctor who specializes in the kind of symptoms you are experiencing) to properly assess the neurological aspects of your condition.  They may order additional tests like an EEG (electroencephalogram) or nerve conduction studies.\n\n* **Communication Challenges:** Given your experience with communication difficulties with Japanese doctors, consider bringing a translator or a trusted friend or family member to appointments.  Write down your concerns and questions beforehand.  If possible, find a doctor with experience in neurology or who is fluent in English/your native language.\n\n\n**In summary:**  I strongly advise you to **not start SELENICA-R 40% until you have a much clearer understanding of why your doctor prescribed it.**  Schedule appointments with a neurologist and discuss your concerns in detail with your doctor about the possible diagnoses and the appropriateness of the medication. The high dose of Magnesium is also something you should discuss with your doctor if your bowel issues are improving.   It is crucial to get a thorough neurological workup to determine the root cause of your problems before starting any new medication, especially one with potential significant side effects.  Two years of suffering is a long time \u2013 don't give up seeking a proper diagnosis.\n"

Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable to be concerned about epilepsy, especially given your family history.  Let's address your questions:\n\n* **Can epilepsy happen for no reason (simple brain malfunction)?**  While many cases of epilepsy have identifiable causes (like head injuries, strokes, infections, or genetic predispositions), a significant portion are classified as \"idiopathic,\" meaning the cause is unknown.  This doesn't necessarily mean a \"simple malfunction\" but rather that current diagnostic tools haven't pinpointed a specific trigger.  The brain is incredibly complex, and sometimes subtle underlying issues remain elusive.\n\n* **Does your mom's cousin's death mean you are in danger? Or his children?**  Having a family history of epilepsy *increases* your risk, but it doesn't guarantee you'll develop it.  The risk is higher for his children than for you, as genetic factors play a significant role. However, the degree of increased risk depends on the specific type of epilepsy and the inheritance pattern within the family.  It's important to note that many people with a family history of epilepsy *never* develop the condition.\n\n* **Can drugs/medications cause epilepsy?** Yes, some medications can increase the risk of seizures or trigger epilepsy in susceptible individuals.  This is a known side effect of certain medications, although it's not common for all drugs. While Citalopram (Celexa) is generally not considered a major trigger for epilepsy, it's crucial to discuss *any* concerns about medication side effects with your doctor.  They can assess your individual risk factors and the potential for drug interactions.\n\n* **Smokers and alcoholics are at higher risk.**  This is true.  Alcohol and tobacco use can disrupt brain function and increase seizure susceptibility.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\nGiven your family history and your interest in the subject,  a consultation with a neurologist or your primary care physician is recommended. They can assess your personal risk factors, taking into account your family history, lifestyle, and any medications you're taking.  They can provide personalized advice and potentially recommend further testing if they deem it necessary.  The fact that you're already aware of your family history is a great first step towards proactive health management.\n\n**Important Note:**  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're concerned after your experiences with flashing lights.  However, experiencing discomfort or a feeling of \"impending doom\" from flashing lights doesn't automatically mean you have epilepsy.  Many people without epilepsy are sensitive to flashing lights, and it can trigger various unpleasant feelings, including:\n\n* **Photosensitivity:** This is a common condition where certain light patterns, like flashing lights, cause unpleasant visual or physical reactions.  It can range from mild discomfort to nausea, headaches, and dizziness.  It's not epilepsy, but it can be quite debilitating for some individuals.\n* **Migraine:** Flashing lights can be a migraine trigger for some people.\n* **Anxiety:** The feeling of \"impending doom\" you describe could be related to anxiety triggered by the flashing lights. The anticipation of a negative reaction can increase anxiety.\n\n**The epilepsy \"test\" video you watched is not a diagnostic tool.**  Online videos claiming to diagnose epilepsy are unreliable and potentially harmful.  A proper diagnosis of epilepsy requires a comprehensive neurological examination and evaluation by a qualified medical professional, typically a neurologist.  They will consider your medical history, conduct a physical exam, and potentially order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to assess your brain's electrical activity.\n\n**Watching the video did not increase your risk of developing epilepsy.** Epilepsy is a complex neurological condition with various causes, and watching a flashing light video is not one of them.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Don't self-diagnose.**  Your experiences warrant a consultation with a doctor, but online tests are not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n* **Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.**  Explain your symptoms and concerns.  They can assess your overall health and refer you to a neurologist if necessary.\n* **Be aware of your triggers.**  Since flashing lights seem to bother you, try to avoid situations with excessive flashing lights whenever possible.\n\nIn short, while your symptoms are concerning, they don't definitively indicate epilepsy.  Seeing a doctor for a proper evaluation is the best way to determine the cause of your discomfort and receive appropriate guidance.\n"

        "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're worried after experiencing these episodes, especially with the increased frequency yesterday.  While your MRI was clear, that doesn't definitively rule out all possibilities.  Here's why:\n\n* **MRI limitations:**  MRIs are excellent for detecting structural abnormalities in the brain, like tumors or large lesions. However, they might not always detect subtle changes in brain activity or smaller abnormalities that could be associated with epilepsy or other neurological conditions.  Temporal lobe epilepsy, in particular, can sometimes be difficult to diagnose with imaging alone.  EEG (electroencephalogram) is often a more sensitive test for detecting abnormal brain electrical activity characteristic of seizures.\n\n* **Other potential causes:**  Your symptoms could be related to several conditions besides temporal lobe epilepsy, including:\n\n    * **Migraine variants:**  Some migraines present with neurological symptoms (aura) similar to what you describe.  The \"zoned out\" feeling, visual disturbances, and even the nausea align with this.\n    * **Panic attacks:**  The dizziness, hot flushes, feeling sick, and the sense of unreality could also point towards panic attacks.\n    * **Other neurological conditions:**  Less common possibilities exist and would require further investigation by a neurologist.\n\n* **Three episodes in one day:** This is a significant increase and warrants further medical attention.  Your doctor dismissing it unless it gets worse is not entirely reassuring given this recent escalation.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion:**  Given the increased frequency and the persistent concerns, it's crucial to seek a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy or another neurologist experienced in diagnosing similar symptoms.\n2. **Request an EEG:**  Specifically ask for an EEG. This test measures the electrical activity of your brain and is often crucial in diagnosing epilepsy.  An EEG might be able to detect subtle abnormalities not visible on an MRI.\n3. **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the details of your episodes \u2013 when they occur, how long they last, the specific symptoms you experience, and anything that seems to trigger them. This information is incredibly valuable for your doctor.\n4. **Don't dismiss your concerns:** Your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant a thorough evaluation.  Your doctor may be minimizing the situation, but your experience is valid.\n\n\nIn short, while an MRI can rule out many things, it's not the only test needed to diagnose neurological conditions like epilepsy or even to determine the cause of your episodes.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and push for further investigations to reach a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management plan.  The increase in frequency is a clear indicator that things are changing and need to be addressed.\n"

Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice or diagnoses.  The information you've provided suggests a serious neurological condition, and it's crucial you seek immediate in-person medical attention.  Your description of frequent convulsive seizures, particularly their clustering (9 in one day), and the ineffectiveness of Keppra, necessitates a thorough evaluation by a neurologist specializing in epilepsy.\n\nWhile you suspect temporal lobe epilepsy or focal onset seizures with secondary generalization, only a neurologist can make an accurate diagnosis.  They will conduct a comprehensive assessment, likely including:\n\n* **Detailed medical history:** This will involve a thorough discussion of your seizure symptoms, frequency, triggers (including stress), and associated sensations (euphoria, nausea).\n* **Neurological examination:**  A physical exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n* **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This test measures the electrical activity in your brain and can help identify abnormal patterns associated with seizures.  An EEG during sleep might be particularly helpful given your seizures' timing.\n* **Brain imaging (MRI or CT scan):** These scans provide detailed images of your brain structure to rule out any underlying abnormalities like tumors or lesions that could be causing seizures.\n* **Blood tests:** To check for any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to seizures.\n\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n* **What is going on in my head?:**  Only a neurologist can determine the specific cause of your seizures after a comprehensive evaluation.\n* **Is this temporal lobe epilepsy?:**  This is a possibility, given the description of your symptoms, but it requires professional confirmation.\n* **Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization?:** Again, this is a possibility that needs to be confirmed through proper medical testing and evaluation.\n* **Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant:**  Absolutely do *not* attempt to change or adjust your medication without your neurologist's guidance.  They will need to assess your situation and determine the most appropriate alternative medication and dosage based on your individual needs and the results of your tests.  They can discuss other anticonvulsants like Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam (if it's not already Keppra), Valproate, Carbamazepine, etc., but the choice will be personalized.\n\n\n**Your immediate priority is to seek emergency medical help if you are experiencing frequent seizures.**  Contact your doctor, go to an emergency room, or call emergency services immediately.

Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time.

All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated by the lack of a clear answer regarding alcohol and epilepsy.  The truth is, there's no single answer that applies to everyone with epilepsy.  Your doctor's advice to limit yourself to two standard drinks is a *general guideline* based on the potential risks, not a hard and fast rule for every individual.\n\nThe fact that you've been able to drink more than that without apparent seizures doesn't mean you're immune to the risks.  Several factors are at play:\n\n* **Individual Variation:**  The way individuals metabolize alcohol and how their epilepsy responds to it varies enormously. Some people with epilepsy may be more sensitive to alcohol's effects than others. This sensitivity isn't always predictable.\n* **Medication Interaction:** Clobazam and Tegretol (carbamazepine) can interact with alcohol in unpredictable ways.  Even if you haven't experienced negative effects so far, continued higher consumption increases your risk of dangerous interactions.  These interactions could subtly affect your seizure threshold, making seizures more likely, even if you don't immediately notice it.  This could be cumulative, meaning the impact increases with continued drinking.\n* **Sleep Deprivation:**  Alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns, even if you don't feel excessively intoxicated.  Since you have nocturnal epilepsy often triggered after sleepwalking,  disrupted sleep could be a significant risk factor increasing your chances of a seizure.\n* **\"Lucky\" vs. Asymptomatic:**  It's possible you haven't experienced negative consequences *yet*.  However, that doesn't mean they won't occur in the future.  The risks accumulate with continued high alcohol consumption.  You could be experiencing subclinical effects (effects that don't show up as obvious symptoms) without realizing it.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. **Talk to your neurologist again:**  Don't let this go.  Explain your concerns and your previous attempts to get a clear answer.  Ask specifically about the potential interactions between your medication and alcohol at higher consumption levels.  Ask if they would recommend any blood tests to monitor your liver function or other potential effects of your alcohol consumption.  Be prepared to discuss your current drinking habits honestly.\n2. **Consider a sleep study:**  A sleep study might shed light on how your sleep patterns are affected by alcohol and how this relates to your seizures.\n3. **Keep a detailed log:** Track your alcohol consumption and any potential effects, including sleep quality and any changes in seizure frequency or severity. This will provide valuable information for your neurologist.\n4. **Reduce your alcohol intake:**  As a precaution, even if your doctor gives you a slightly more lenient guideline, significantly reducing your alcohol intake is the safest course of action. The potential risks outweigh the perceived benefits of drinking heavily.\n\n\n**In short:**  You may have been lucky so far, but continuing to drink heavily is a gamble with potentially serious consequences for your health and seizure control.  A frank discussion with your neurologist is crucial to determining a safe level of alcohol consumption for *you* specifically.  Don't rely on past experiences; the risks are real and can change over time.\n"

Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "There's no definitive scientific evidence stating that people with epilepsy *cannot* use iontophoresis.

Electric currents, even the low levels used in iontophoresis, *could* theoretically trigger a seizure in *some* individuals who are highly susceptible.  This is not a guaranteed outcome, and it's far from a universal contraindication.\n\n**Here's what you need to do:**\n\n* **Consult your neurologist or epileptologist:** This is absolutely crucial.  They are best equipped to assess your individual risk based on your specific type of epilepsy, seizure frequency, medication regimen, and overall health. They can discuss the potential risks and benefits with you.  Don't rely on online information alone.\n\n* **Discuss it with your dermatologist or doctor recommending iontophoresis:**  They also need to be aware of your epilepsy before you begin treatment. They can help weigh the risks and benefits in the context of your sweating condition.\n\n* **Understand the potential risks:**  While rare, the possibility of a seizure triggered by electrical stimulation exists.  You'll want to be aware of the signs of a seizure and have a plan in place in case one occurs during or after treatment.\n\nIn short, don't rule out iontophoresis, but don't assume it's safe without a thorough discussion with your medical professionals.

        "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the long-term effects of epilepsy on your brain health.  Let's address your questions:\n\n**Does epilepsy increase the risk of brain-related diseases with time?**\n\nYes, some studies suggest an increased risk of certain neurological conditions in people with epilepsy compared to the general population.  These increased risks can include:\n\n* **Cognitive decline:**  This can manifest as problems with memory, attention, and executive function. The degree of cognitive impairment varies greatly depending on factors like epilepsy type, seizure frequency and severity, and the presence of other medical conditions.  Your experience of memory loss after your last seizure highlights this potential risk.\n* **Dementia:** Some research indicates a slightly higher risk of developing dementia, particularly certain types like Alzheimer's disease, in individuals with epilepsy.\n* **Stroke:**  While not directly caused by epilepsy, certain epilepsy syndromes or anti-seizure medications can increase the risk of stroke.\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  There's also some evidence linking epilepsy to a slightly higher risk of other neurological conditions, but the research is ongoing and the relationship isn't always clear.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that these are *increased risks*, not certainties. Many people with epilepsy live long and healthy lives without developing these conditions.  The extent of the increased risk also varies greatly depending on several factors, including the type of epilepsy, seizure frequency and severity, age of onset, and other health conditions.\n\n**Are seizures and partial seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all costs?**\n\nSeizures, both generalized (like the ones you experienced initially) and partial (focal), can cause temporary changes in brain activity and potentially have long-term effects.  Repeated seizures, particularly prolonged or severe ones, can increase the risk of brain damage.  However, it's not a simple case of \"avoid at all costs.\"  Effective seizure control through medication and lifestyle modifications is the primary goal.\n\nYour experience of partial seizures acting as a warning sign is valuable. This demonstrates that you're aware of your triggers and can take steps to prevent major seizures. This proactive approach is excellent.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* **Prepare detailed questions for your neurologist:** Write down all your concerns, including your specific questions about the long-term risks of your epilepsy type and the potential impact of seizures on your brain.  Your experience of memory loss after your last seizure is particularly important to discuss.\n* **Advocate for yourself:**  If you feel rushed or dismissed by your neurologist, consider seeking a second opinion from another specialist.  Finding a neurologist who takes your concerns seriously is essential.\n* **Maintain open communication with your doctor:** Regularly discuss your medication, any changes in your seizure frequency or severity, and any new symptoms you experience.\n* **Lifestyle modifications:**  Continue to prioritize sleep, medication adherence, and stress management. These are crucial for seizure control and overall well-being.\n\nIn summary, while epilepsy does increase the risk of certain brain-related diseases, it's not a life sentence.  Proactive management through medication, lifestyle choices, and regular communication with your neurologist are key to minimizing these risks and maximizing your quality of life.  Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel your concerns are not adequately addressed.\n"

        "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling anxious while waiting for your sleep-deprived EEG.  Experiencing these episodes of inattention, staring spells, and feeling \"spaced out\" is certainly something to investigate, but it's important to avoid self-diagnosing.  Many conditions can mimic the symptoms you describe, and only a medical professional can determine the cause.\n\n**What you've described could be consistent with several possibilities, including but not limited to:**\n\n* **Absent seizures (petit mal seizures):** These are brief periods of staring and unresponsiveness, often without major motor activity.  The \"good feeling\" you describe during your staring spells is *not* typical of absent seizures, though some people report a brief sense of pleasant detachment.  The post-stare comment \"why did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\" is more suggestive of a different type of event.\n\n* **Daydreaming or inattention:**  It's very common for people to experience periods of inattention, especially when tired or stressed. This can involve seemingly zoning out, not fully processing what's being said, and then needing a moment to refocus.\n\n* **Other neurological conditions:**  Other neurological conditions could cause similar symptoms, making a proper diagnosis essential.\n\n* **Psychological factors:**  Stress, anxiety, and other mental health conditions can contribute to inattention and periods of dissociation or detachment.\n\n\n**Regarding your question about late-onset epilepsy:** It's *possible* to develop epilepsy later in life, though it's less common than having it diagnosed in childhood or adolescence.  Many types of epilepsy have subtle or infrequent seizures that may go unnoticed for years, particularly if they are only absent seizures.  The flashing lights you experience are also suggestive of photosensitive epilepsy, so this is something the EEG should help to investigate.\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n* **Focus on your upcoming EEG:**  This is the most important step in getting a diagnosis.  Try to avoid speculating too much beforehand, as this can increase anxiety.\n\n* **Keep a detailed diary:** Before your EEG, keep track of when these episodes happen, how long they last, and any triggers you notice.  This will be helpful information for your doctor.\n\n* **Discuss your concerns with your neurologist:** After the EEG, discuss all your concerns and symptoms openly with your neurologist. They will be able to interpret the results and provide a diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan if needed.\n\n* **Don't self-diagnose:**  Avoid searching online for answers, as this often leads to increased anxiety and inaccurate self-diagnoses.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and it's good that you're seeking medical attention.  The EEG will provide valuable information, and your neurologist will be able to give you a clear understanding of what's happening.  Try to focus on preparing for the test and trust the process.\n"

        "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",

        "answer": "It's great that you're proactive about your health and seeking answers!  Your blood test results show low folate and low ferritin, indicating deficiencies in these two essential nutrients. Let's break down your questions:\n\n**How are low folate and ferritin connected?**\n\nWhile a poor diet is a common cause of both deficiencies, there are other ways they can be linked:\n\n* **Malabsorption:**  Conditions affecting nutrient absorption in the gut (like celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or even some parasites) can impact the absorption of both folate and iron.  Low ferritin often accompanies low folate because of the shared absorption pathway.\n\n* **Underlying medical conditions:**  Certain medical conditions, beyond the gastrointestinal ones mentioned above, can lead to deficiencies. Your fatigue and increased thirst could be signs of something needing further investigation.\n\n* **Medication interaction:** While Keppra doesn't typically cause folate or iron deficiency, it's worth mentioning to your doctor, as sometimes medication interactions are unexpected.\n\n\n**Could this affect your epilepsy?**\n\nBoth folate and iron deficiencies *can* potentially affect epilepsy.  While it's not a direct cause-and-effect relationship in every case, deficiencies in these nutrients can influence neurotransmitter function and overall brain health, which could theoretically impact seizure control.  It's crucial to discuss this with your neurologist and GP.\n\n**Your Diet:**\n\nDespite your seemingly healthy diet,  your body isn't absorbing these nutrients efficiently. The fact that you have light periods could be a contributing factor, as heavy periods are a more common cause of iron deficiency, but that doesn't rule out other reasons.  This is why simply consuming these nutrients might not be enough.\n\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n* **Appointment with your GP:**  This is your next crucial step.  They can explore the possibilities mentioned above, potentially ordering further tests to check for malabsorption issues or other underlying conditions.\n* **Consult your neurologist:** Once you have a clearer picture from your GP, discuss the results with your neurologist. They can assess whether your low folate and ferritin levels might impact your epilepsy management and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.\n\n\n**In short:**  Don't dismiss the possibility that something beyond your diet is causing these deficiencies.  The fatigue, increased thirst, and pale skin should be investigated thoroughly by your doctor.  Addressing the underlying cause is key to resolving these issues and preventing further complications.\n"

        "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious after your son's first seizure.  Receiving a diagnosis of epilepsy, especially after a single event, is incredibly stressful.  Let's address your questions one by one:\n\n**1. How come he had an abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?**\n\nAn EEG measures the electrical activity in the brain.  A seizure leaves a kind of \"electrical footprint\" that can be detectable on an EEG for some time afterward.  It doesn't necessarily mean he's constantly having abnormal brain activity.  The EEG abnormality likely reflects the after-effects of the seizure, and a longer-term video EEG will help determine if he has ongoing abnormal electrical activity between seizures.  The initial EEG isn't necessarily representative of his baseline brain activity.\n\n\n**2. Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?**\n\nIt's unlikely that the single seizure *itself* significantly affected his growth or mental development, especially given the normal CT scan.  However, *untreated* epilepsy *can* potentially impact development in some cases, although this is not guaranteed.  The focus now is on controlling seizures with medication to prevent future events and their potential long-term consequences.\n\n\n**3. Should we worry about an underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?**\n\nThe decision to forgo an MRI at this stage is common after a normal CT scan, particularly with a child having a first seizure. MRIs are more sensitive than CT scans but carry a slightly higher cost and risk (though minimal). The ER doctors likely felt the initial findings decreased the chance of finding a readily treatable underlying structural issue.  However, you are absolutely entitled to request a second opinion and discuss the possibility of an MRI with another neurologist.  If the long-term video EEG continues to show abnormal findings, an MRI might be more strongly considered.\n\n\n**4. Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hair loss, liver toxicity?**\n\nDepakote (valproic acid) can have side effects, including weight gain, hair loss, and liver problems. However, the severity varies greatly between individuals.  Many children tolerate it well with minimal side effects.  Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor liver function.  It's not possible to predict exactly how your son will react; close monitoring by his doctor is key.  WebMD is a good starting point but lacks the nuance of individual experiences.  Talking to other parents whose children take Depakote could offer some real-world perspectives, but remember each child is different.\n\n**5. I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?**\n\nWhile CBD is being studied for its potential role in epilepsy, its efficacy is not established, and it's not a proven replacement for anti-seizure medication in most cases.  Stopping Depakote without medical supervision is risky, as it could lead to more seizures.  It's crucial to work with your neurologist to find the best approach.  They can weigh the risks and benefits of Depakote against other options if needed, but using untested alternatives without medical guidance is dangerous.\n\n\n**6. Should we get a second or third opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?**\n\nGetting a second opinion is entirely reasonable and recommended, especially given your concerns.  You can show the EEG results to other neurologists, but a second evaluation with a new neurologist would involve a new physical exam and potentially new testing. They can provide a fresh perspective and answer any remaining questions you have.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYou are right to be cautious and inquisitive.  Your concerns are valid.  However, making informed decisions requires collaboration with your son's healthcare team.  Consider these next steps:\n\n* **Seek a second opinion:**  This will give you greater confidence in the treatment plan.\n* **Discuss your concerns openly:**  Talk to the neurologist about your anxiety surrounding Depakote, your concerns about side effects, and your desire to explore all avenues for management.\n* **Be proactive in monitoring:**  Follow up on all blood tests and appointments.\n* **Join a support group:** Connecting with other families facing similar situations can be incredibly helpful.\n\n\nYour son's health is paramount.  By remaining involved and actively participating in his care, you are demonstrating excellent parenting. Don't hesitate to advocate for your son and seek the best possible medical care for him.\n"

        "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on your description, what you experienced doesn't sound definitively like a seizure, but it shares some similarities and warrants further investigation by a medical professional.  Several aspects are concerning:\n\n* **The inability to move, speak, or open your eyes for 20 seconds:** This period of paralysis is a significant symptom. While sleep paralysis usually involves the inability to move *while falling asleep or waking up*, the timing and your report of being wide awake raise concerns.\n\n* **Amplified sound and vibrating sensations:** These sensory disturbances are atypical of typical sleep paralysis and could be suggestive of a neurological event.\n\n* **Preceding anxiety and caffeine consumption:**  High levels of caffeine and anxiety can lower the seizure threshold in some individuals.  Your heavy caffeine intake combined with the anxiety could have been a contributing factor, but it doesn't explain the event itself.\n\n* **History of epilepsy:** Your history of seizures, even if they occurred years ago, increases the risk of recurrence, and makes this episode more worrisome.  The fact that the seizures seemed to cease with the onset of menstruation is not uncommon but doesn't rule out future events.\n\n\n**What is NOT suggestive of a typical seizure:**\n\n* **Lack of convulsions:**  Grand mal seizures typically involve convulsions.  Your description lacks this key characteristic.\n\n* **Post-event exhaustion:** While exhaustion can occur after a seizure, it's not always present.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\nThis episode needs to be evaluated by your doctor or neurologist immediately.  **Do not delay seeking medical attention.**  They can perform a thorough assessment, considering your medical history, current medications, and the details of this episode.  They may order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor brainwave activity and rule out any underlying neurological issues.\n\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information above is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a diagnosis or treatment recommendation.

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",

        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a diagnosis or treatment plan.  **You absolutely need to seek medical attention.** Your symptoms warrant a proper medical evaluation.  Delaying this could have serious consequences.\n\nBased on your description, several possibilities exist, and it's impossible to determine the cause without a proper examination.  The sharp pain in your left side, lower rib cage, radiating to your heart and lung area, coupled with the car accident, is concerning.  While your clinic doctor ruled out palpable lumps, several issues remain possibilities:\n\n* **Rib fracture(s):**  Even without obvious swelling or skin discoloration, rib fractures can occur.  They are often painful, especially with deep breaths or movement.  X-rays are the definitive diagnostic tool for this.\n\n* **Costochondritis:** This is inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone.  It can cause sharp, localized pain that worsens with breathing or palpation (as you experienced).\n\n* **Musculoskeletal injury:**  The impact from the accident could have caused bruising, muscle strains, or ligament sprains in your chest wall.\n\n* **Pleurisy:**  This inflammation of the lining of your lungs *could* be a possibility, causing sharp chest pain, especially with breathing. However, the lack of other associated symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) makes this less likely, but still a consideration.\n\n* **Lung contusion (bruised lung):** A bruised lung is a possibility, but typically presents with more significant symptoms like shortness of breath and potentially coughing up blood.  However, the lack of these doesn't rule it out entirely.\n\n* **Other internal injuries:** While less likely given your current symptoms, more serious internal injuries can't be ruled out without imaging and further examination.\n\n**Why you need a doctor immediately:**  The potential for a rib fracture, lung contusion, or other internal injury necessitates immediate medical attention.  Anti-inflammatory medications might provide temporary relief, but they won't address the underlying cause.  Ignoring these symptoms could lead to complications like pneumonia (if you have a lung injury), collapsed lung, or persistent pain.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Seek financial assistance:** Explore options for getting health insurance or finding low-cost or free healthcare clinics in your area.  Many hospitals have financial assistance programs for patients who cannot afford care.\n\n* **Emergency room visit (if possible):** If your pain worsens significantly, you experience shortness of breath, or you cough up blood, go to the nearest emergency room immediately.  This is crucial for conditions that might be life-threatening.\n\n* **Contact local charities or non-profit organizations:**  They can often assist with medical bills or connect you with resources for affordable healthcare.\n\nDo not delay seeking professional medical help.

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're scared and frustrated with your epilepsy.  Dealing with seizures, especially at your age, is incredibly challenging, and the fear of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is a very real concern.  However, I cannot give you medical advice.  The decision of whether or not to undergo these tests and potentially brain surgery is a highly personal one that requires careful consideration with your medical team.\n\n**Here's what you absolutely MUST do:**\n\n* **Talk extensively with your doctor and/or neurologist:**  Your feelings of fear and uncertainty are completely valid, and your doctor needs to hear them. They should explain in detail:\n    * **The purpose of each test (PET, CAT, MRI):** What information will they provide, and how will that information guide treatment decisions?\n    * **The risks and benefits of the tests:**  Are there any potential complications from the tests themselves (e.g., allergic reactions to contrast dye)?\n    * **The specific type of surgery being considered:**  What part of your brain would be targeted?

What is the success rate for this type of surgery in similar cases?\n    * **The likelihood of success:**  There's no guarantee that surgery will eliminate your seizures entirely. Your doctor should discuss the possibilities realistically.\n    * **Alternative treatment options:**  Are there other medications or therapies that could be tried before surgery?  This includes exploring different combinations of your current medications and potentially newer anti-seizure drugs.  They should discuss the pros and cons of each alternative.\n    * **SUDEP risk mitigation strategies:**  Your doctor should explain how they will monitor you during the tests and potential surgery to minimize the risk of SUDEP.\n    * **Long-term management plan:** What will happen after the tests, regardless of the outcome?\n\n* **Seek a second opinion:** It's always a good idea to get a second opinion from another neurologist specializing in epilepsy surgery to ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of your options.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Your age:** Being 16 introduces unique considerations.  The impact of brain surgery at this age on your development needs to be carefully evaluated.\n* **Multiple conditions:**  The fact that you have several other conditions (ADHD, Asperger's, anxiety) needs to be factored into the decision-making process. Surgery might affect these conditions, positively or negatively.\n* **Medication management:** Optimizing your current medication regimen before considering surgery should be explored fully.\n\n**In short:**  Don't rush into a decision.  Arm yourself with as much information as possible from your medical team, get a second opinion, and allow yourself time to process everything before making a choice.  Your fear is valid, but informed decision-making is crucial.  You deserve to feel heard and understood throughout this process.\n"

Understanding potential triggers is crucial for prevention.\n* **What is the likely cause of the dystonia given my epilepsy and temporal lobe involvement?**  Is it medication-related, a direct consequence of my epilepsy, or something else entirely?\n* **What diagnostic tests (e.g., EEG, MRI, blood tests) are needed to fully investigate the cause of the dystonia?** A comprehensive evaluation will help rule out other possible causes.\n* **What are the short-term and long-term risks associated with this type of dystonia?** This will help you understand the potential severity and trajectory of the condition.\n* **Are there any adjustments to my current Keppra dosage or other medication changes that could help prevent future attacks?**  A medication review is important.\n\n**Regarding Epilepsy Management:**\n\n* **Is my current Keppra dosage sufficient, given the recent dystonia and the fact it doesn't seem to be controlling my seizures effectively?**  Your doctor may want to adjust the dose or consider adding another anti-epileptic drug (AED).\n* **What are the potential risks and benefits of adding another AED to my current regimen?**  Understand the trade-offs before making any changes.\n* **What other options are available if the Keppra doesn't improve, besides adding another AED?**  Explore alternative approaches, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) if appropriate.\n* **How often should I have EEG monitoring to assess my epilepsy control?** Regular monitoring is essential to track progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n\n**Regarding Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**\n\n* **Am I a candidate for DBS given my diagnosis and the severity of my symptoms?** DBS is a significant procedure and only appropriate for specific patients.\n* **What are the specific criteria for considering DBS for my type of epilepsy and dystonia?**  Understanding eligibility criteria is crucial.\n* **What are the potential benefits and risks of DBS, including complications, side effects, and the recovery process?**  A thorough understanding of potential risks is paramount.\n* **What is the success rate of DBS for my specific condition?** Success rates vary depending on the individual and the targeted area.\n* **What is the procedure involved, including surgical techniques, recovery time, and long-term follow-up care?** Get detailed information about the procedure and what to expect.\n* **What is the cost of DBS, including surgery, implantation, and long-term follow-up?**  Consider the financial implications of this procedure.\n* **What is the process of getting a referral for a DBS evaluation and consultation?**  Learn about the steps involved in getting assessed for DBS.\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n* **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the frequency, duration, and any triggers of your seizures and dystonia episodes. This information will be invaluable for your doctor.\n* **Seek a second opinion:**  Consider getting a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and movement disorders.\n* **Join a support group:**  Connecting with others facing similar challenges can provide emotional support and practical advice.\n\nRemember, this is not an exhaustive list, and your individual questions may vary.  By being prepared and asking these well-defined questions, you can have a productive discussion with your doctor and make informed decisions about your treatment.  Good luck with your appointment!\n"

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to diagnose your girlfriend's condition. I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information you've provided is concerning, and it points to a complex neurological issue requiring in-person expert evaluation by a neurologist specializing in epilepsy.  The fact that she's experienced both prolonged seizures and shorter, focal seizures, coupled with memory problems, warrants a thorough investigation.\n\nLet's address your specific questions based on the information given, keeping in mind this is not a diagnosis:\n\n**Was her head-to-head movement seizure activity?**  Yes, rhythmic head movements, especially in the context of other seizure symptoms (unresponsiveness, other motor manifestations), are highly suggestive of seizure activity.  This could be part of a focal seizure originating in the temporal lobe, as suggested by the EEG.\n\n**What are your thoughts on what she had?** The initial presentation with high fever, prolonged seizure activity (status epilepticus), and subsequent focal seizures suggests several possibilities, including:\n\n* **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):** The abnormal EEG findings pointing towards the left temporal lobe strongly support this.  However, the initial presentation with status epilepticus and the atypical nature of some seizures needs further consideration.\n* **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** Although the spinal taps were negative, autoimmune encephalitis can be challenging to diagnose.  Further investigation might be needed, potentially including more specialized blood tests.\n* **Other causes of seizures:**  While less likely given the EEG findings, other possibilities include structural brain lesions (though the MRI was unremarkable), genetic epilepsy syndromes, or an infection (although this seems less probable given the negative findings from the extensive testing).  The initial high fever could be a red herring or a triggering factor for the seizures.\n\n**What are your thoughts on the current medication?** Your girlfriend is on a high dose of multiple AEDs.  This is common in cases of refractory epilepsy (meaning seizures are not well-controlled despite medication).  The addition of Vimpat (lacosamide) is a reasonable approach if the current regimen isn't effectively controlling her seizures.  However, *the dosage and the choice of AEDs should be determined and adjusted only by her neurologist.*  They need to carefully monitor her for side effects and adjust the medications as needed.  The high doses raise concerns about potential side effects.  Regular blood tests to monitor drug levels are crucial.\n\n**Crucially Important:**\n\n* **Video EEG monitoring:**  This is essential for further evaluating her seizure type and origin.  This involves staying in a hospital for a period with continuous EEG monitoring during sleep and wakefulness, to better understand the nature of her seizures.\n* **Neuropsychological testing:**  Given her memory problems, comprehensive neuropsychological testing is needed to assess the extent of cognitive impairment.\n* **Re-evaluation by a Neurologist:**  This is absolutely critical.  She needs to be under the care of a neurologist experienced in epilepsy, preferably one who can review all of her records and potentially order additional investigations. They may need to consider alternative diagnoses or adjust the treatment strategy.  Consider seeking a second opinion if you're not satisfied with the current progress.\n\n\nThis information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  **Please seek immediate medical attention from a qualified neurologist.**  The prolonged seizures and ongoing issues are serious and require prompt and expert intervention.  Don't hesitate to advocate for your girlfriend to receive the best possible care.  The videos of her seizures will be invaluable to her medical team.\n"

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling anxious and uncertain after discovering that your past episodes were likely seizures.  What you've experienced warrants further investigation, and it's definitely not something to dismiss.  While you've done some research, only a medical professional can accurately diagnose epilepsy.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n* **See a neurologist:** This is the most crucial step.  A neurologist specializes in the brain and nervous system. They can perform a thorough evaluation, including a neurological exam, review your history, and potentially order further tests like an EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor your brainwave activity and possibly an MRI to rule out structural abnormalities in the brain.  The EEG is particularly important in diagnosing epilepsy, as it can detect abnormal electrical activity even when you're not having a seizure.\n\n* **Don't self-diagnose:** While your research has been helpful in raising your awareness, online information can't replace a professional medical opinion.  The fact that your events were triggered by physical stimuli is relevant information for the neurologist.  They'll need to piece together the entire picture to determine a diagnosis.\n\n* **Two seizures is significant:** While the two events were years apart, two unprovoked seizures *do* significantly increase the likelihood of epilepsy.  The time gap doesn't rule out a diagnosis, and the triggers you describe are valuable information for the doctor.\n\n* **Implications of a diagnosis:**  If diagnosed with epilepsy, there are various treatment options available, including medication to help prevent future seizures.  With proper management, many people with epilepsy can live full and productive lives. The implications can vary depending on the type and severity of epilepsy, which is why it's vital to receive a formal diagnosis from a neurologist.\n\n* **Don't worry (yet):**  It's natural to feel worried, but try not to jump to conclusions before you see a doctor. The neurologist will be able to provide accurate information and discuss any potential risks or concerns.\n\n\nIn short:  **Scheduling an appointment with a neurologist is the best course of action.**  Don't delay seeking medical attention. Your health and well-being are the priority.  Explain everything you've experienced in detail to them.  They'll be able to answer your questions and provide the appropriate guidance and care.\n"

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The interaction between your epilepsy medications (Depakote and Keppra) and HRT is complex and requires a discussion with your neurologist and possibly an endocrinologist experienced in transgender care.  While I can't definitively say whether or not there will be an interaction, I can explain why it's crucial to discuss this with your medical team before starting HRT.\n\n**Why it's important to consult your doctors:**\n\n* **Individual Variability:** The effect of HRT on seizure control is highly variable and depends on several factors including:\n    * **Specific HRT regimen:**  The types and dosages of estrogen and anti-androgens used will influence the potential interaction.\n    * **Your individual metabolism:** How your body processes both your epilepsy medications and HRT hormones will determine the overall impact.\n    * **Severity of your epilepsy:**  Someone with well-controlled epilepsy may tolerate changes differently than someone with frequent seizures.\n* **Potential Mechanisms of Interaction:** While not definitively established for all AEDs and HRT combinations, potential mechanisms for increased seizure activity include:\n    * **Hormonal Effects on GABAergic Systems:**  Some anti-epileptic drugs, including Depakote (valproic acid), work by enhancing the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.  Hormonal fluctuations from HRT *could* potentially interfere with this system.\n    * **Enzyme Induction/Inhibition:** HRT may influence the enzymes that metabolize your AEDs, leading to either increased or decreased levels of the drugs in your blood. This could lead to subtherapeutic levels (not enough drug to control seizures) or potentially toxic levels.\n    * **Direct Hormonal Effects on Neuronal Excitability:**  Hormones themselves can influence neuronal excitability, and this effect could interact with your AEDs.\n\n**What you should discuss with your doctors:**\n\n* **Your specific HRT plan:**  Provide details about the hormones, dosages, and administration method (pills, patches, injections).\n* **Your seizure history:**  A complete history of your seizure frequency, types, and severity is crucial.\n* **Current medication list:**  Include all medications, supplements, and even over-the-counter drugs.\n* **Concerns about increased seizure frequency:** Explicitly state your worries about HRT potentially exacerbating your epilepsy.\n* **Monitoring plan:** Ask your doctors about how they would monitor your seizure control and medication levels during and after the initiation of HRT.  This might involve blood tests to check AED levels.\n\n**In short:** Don't rely on internet information to make this decision.  Your health and safety depend on a thorough assessment and personalized management plan from your medical professionals. Scheduling an appointment to discuss this with your neurologist is essential.  You can prepare for the appointment by writing down your questions and concerns, which might help alleviate some of your shyness.\n"

        "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

        "answer": "This is a very difficult situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious.  It sounds like your mother is experiencing a complex interplay of medical issues that need careful investigation.  While I cannot provide a diagnosis, I can offer suggestions on what information to bring to her doctor to help them understand her condition better:\n\n\n**For the Doctor's Visit:  A Detailed and Organized Approach**\n\nPrepare a comprehensive document organized by date and symptom. This will be invaluable for the doctor. Include:\n\n* **Detailed Timeline of Falls:**  For each fall, note the date, time, location, preceding events (e.g., was she standing, walking, lying down?), any warning signs (dizziness, weakness), the type of fall (sudden collapse, gradual weakening), the duration of the episode, and her level of consciousness afterward.  Include the severity of any injuries sustained.  The hospital stay is particularly important to highlight \u2013 why were the episodes absent during that period?\n\n* **Description of \"Seizures\":**  Be very precise in describing the episodes the doctors are calling seizures.  Note the duration, frequency, body parts involved, her level of awareness during and after, and any aura or warning signs before they begin.  The \"surfing\" leg motion is crucial information.  Video recording these events (if possible and ethical \u2013 with her consent) would be incredibly helpful.\n\n* **Medication List:** Include all medications, dosages, times of administration, and how long she has been taking each one. Note any changes in medication or dosage recently. Emphasize the concern about the interaction between gabapentin and Depakote and the timing of the cognitive decline.\n\n* **Cognitive Decline:** Document specific examples of her cognitive decline.  Don't just say \"memory loss.\"  Instead, provide concrete examples like the dinner planning incident, spelling difficulties, and inability to perform simple math.  Keep a log of these instances over several days to show patterns.\n\n* **Family History:** Include details about the family history of dementia, Alzheimer's, seizures, falls, and the specific pattern of female longevity you mentioned (even if it seems anecdotal, it's still relevant information).\n\n* **Other Relevant Information:** Note any other symptoms like changes in sleep, appetite, mood, vision, or hearing. Mention her smoking history.\n\n**Questions to Ask the Doctor:**\n\n* **Medication Interactions:**  Directly and firmly ask about potential interactions between the gabapentin and Depakote, especially in the context of the cognitive decline.  Request a review of her medications by a pharmacist specializing in drug interactions.\n\n* **Diagnostic Testing:**  Insist on a comprehensive assessment, potentially including:\n    * **Detailed neurological exam:**  This is essential.\n    * **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To assess brain electrical activity.\n    * **MRI or CT scan of the brain:** To rule out structural abnormalities.\n    * **Blood tests:**  To check for vitamin deficiencies, infections, or other underlying medical conditions.\n    * **Cognitive testing:**  To assess her cognitive abilities more formally.\n\n* **Alternative Diagnoses:**  Discuss possibilities beyond epilepsy and explore the possibility of other conditions that could explain her symptoms, such as:\n    * **Neurodegenerative diseases:**  Like Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.\n    * **Vitamin B12 deficiency:**  Can cause neurological problems.\n    * **Normal pressure hydrocephalus:**  A build-up of fluid in the brain.\n    * **Side effects from medications:** This needs to be explored more thoroughly than it appears to have been so far.\n\n* **Referral to Specialists:**  If needed, ask for referrals to neurologists, geriatricians, or other specialists who can provide further expertise.\n\n**Regarding Your Anxiety:**\n\nYour anxiety is completely understandable.  Focusing on gathering this information and advocating for your mother will help you feel more proactive.  Consider seeking support for your own anxiety through therapy or support groups.  Your academic achievements are significant, but don't feel guilty about wanting to support your mother during this difficult time.  There's no shame in adjusting plans to accommodate family needs.\n\n**Medicare:** Continue to pursue Medicare applications.  There are resources that can help navigate the application process.\n\n\nThis is a challenging situation requiring persistent advocacy. By presenting this organized information, you can greatly help your mother's medical team arrive at a diagnosis and a better treatment plan.  Remember, your observations are valuable \u2013 don't be afraid to express your concerns clearly and firmly.\n"

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's wonderful to hear about your daughter's progress after discontinuing the valproic acid!  It's a remarkable improvement, and it highlights the complex interplay between medication, neurological conditions, and development.  While I cannot provide medical diagnoses or advice (that's the role of her medical team), I can offer some possible explanations for the observed changes:\n\n* **Valproic Acid's Side Effects Masking Underlying Issues:**  The most likely explanation is that the low dose of valproic acid, while seemingly managing seizures, was inadvertently masking or exacerbating other underlying issues related to her conditions (epilepsy, ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion).  The medication may have had a sedative or dulling effect on her cognitive function and awareness, hindering her ability to communicate and interact effectively.  Removing this \"mask\" allowed her true developmental potential to shine through.\n\n* **Impact on Brain Function:** Valproic acid, even at low doses, can affect various neurotransmitter systems in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are crucial for cognitive function, mood regulation, and social interaction.  Discontinuing the medication might have allowed these systems to rebalance, leading to improved communication, awareness, and social engagement.\n\n* **15q26.1 Microdeletion's Variable Expression:** The 15q26.1 microdeletion is a genetic condition with variable expressivity, meaning the symptoms and severity can differ greatly between individuals.  It's possible that the medication was interfering with her ability to compensate for the challenges posed by this deletion.\n\n* **Improved Overall Health and Well-being:**  It's also possible that simply being free from the subtle side effects of the medication (even if they weren't overtly noticeable) led to a general improvement in her well-being, energy levels, and cognitive function, ultimately contributing to the observed behavioral changes.\n\n* **The \"Happy-Go-Lucky\" Baseline:** The fact that she was described as \"happy-go-lucky\" as a toddler suggests a pre-existing temperament that might have been suppressed by the medication.  The return to this baseline temperament could account for some of the positive behavioral shifts.\n\n**Regarding the Mood Swings:** The occasional sadness and crying episodes could be:\n\n* **Withdrawal Effects (though less likely at such a low dose):**  While less common at low doses, abrupt cessation of valproic acid can sometimes lead to withdrawal symptoms, including mood changes.  However, given the timeframe and the overwhelmingly positive changes, this seems less likely.\n* **Normal Emotional Development:** As she's developing and experiencing more complex emotions, it's normal to see mood fluctuations.  The improved awareness might simply mean she's better able to express these emotions now.\n* **Unrelated to medication:**  The mood swings could be completely unrelated to the medication discontinuation.\n\n**Important Note:**  It is crucial to continue monitoring your daughter's progress closely and report any concerns to her neurologist and other specialists involved in her care.  While the changes are positive, it's essential to have regular checkups to ensure her well-being and to address any new challenges that might arise.  The occasional mood swings warrant discussion with her healthcare team, and they can help determine if they're a cause for concern.\n\nThis is not medical advice, and you should discuss these observations with your daughter's neurologist and other relevant healthcare providers. They can offer a more accurate and tailored assessment of her situation.\n"

        "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The letter indicates that the EEG showed abnormal electrical activity in your brain.  \"Spike and wave discharges\" are a characteristic pattern seen in some types of seizures, particularly absence seizures and certain types of focal seizures.  The location, \"right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal,\" means the abnormal activity was strongest in the frontal lobe of your right brain hemisphere, with some spread to the temporal and central regions.\n\nThe fact that you didn't have a seizure *during* the recording is important.  It means the EEG detected underlying electrical instability in your brain even when you weren't experiencing symptoms. This is common.  Many people with epilepsy have periods of normal brain activity interspersed with periods of abnormal electrical activity that may or may not cause noticeable symptoms.  The spikes and waves detected suggest that your brain is prone to generating this abnormal activity, which increases the likelihood of seizures.\n\n**It's crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.** This interpretation is for informational purposes only.  You absolutely *must* discuss this with your neurologist as soon as possible. They can explain the significance of the findings in the context of your overall medical history and symptoms.

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

        "answer": "This is a complex situation requiring multiple steps.  Let's break down your options for medical insurance and financial assistance in San Diego County, California.  Your concerns are valid, and the system can be confusing to navigate.\n\n**1. Immediate Medical Needs:**\n\n* **Stop taking Keppra without consulting a doctor:**  The fact that it's causing significant side effects and not seemingly controlling your seizures is crucial information.  Contact your Mexican doctor or find an English-speaking neurologist in San Diego *immediately*.  Explain the side effects and that the medication isn't helping.  They may need to adjust the dosage, change the medication, or investigate other potential causes. Your safety is paramount.\n\n* **Find a safety net clinic:**  Many San Diego clinics offer sliding-scale fees based on income.  These clinics may be able to provide some immediate medical attention even before your insurance situation is resolved.  Search online for \"safety net clinics San Diego\" to find options near you.  These clinics can also help with referrals to specialists.\n\n* **Seek emergency medical attention only if absolutely necessary:**  Unless you're experiencing a life-threatening situation, avoid another expensive ER visit. Safety net clinics can handle most urgent needs.\n\n**2.  Insurance Options:**\n\n* **Covered California:**  While your unemployment income currently prevents you from getting significant subsidies, your situation is likely to change once unemployment ends.  You should *still* apply to Covered California now.  They can assess your eligibility, and once your unemployment ends, you may qualify for significantly reduced premiums.  This is crucial for long-term health coverage.\n\n* **Medi-Cal (California Medicaid):** Your income from unemployment *might* make you ineligible currently, but you should still apply.  The fact that you'll soon have no income is a strong argument for eligibility once the unemployment benefits end.  Apply now; your situation might change before processing is completed.\n\n* **County Assistance:**  Contact the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) as planned on Monday. Be prepared to explain your entire situation in detail, emphasizing:\n    * The recent onset of serious symptoms (seizures, disorientation).\n    * The brain cyst identified in Tijuana.\n    * Your inability to work due to your medical condition.\n    * Your imminent loss of unemployment income.\n    * Your existing $5,000 ER debt.\n\n  They may have programs to assist with short-term medical care or financial assistance to address the ER bill.  Be prepared to provide all documentation, including your Tijuana medical records (get them translated if possible).  Explain you need help bridging the gap until you're eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\n\n**3. Financial Assistance for ER Bill:**\n\n* **Hospital Financial Assistance:**  Contact the hospital that billed you the $5,000.  They often have financial assistance programs and payment plans, especially for patients who demonstrate financial hardship.  Provide all relevant documentation, including your unemployment paperwork.\n\n* **Charity Care:**  Many hospitals have charity care programs that can reduce or eliminate medical debt for low-income patients.  Inquire about this explicitly.\n\n\n**4. Long-Term Disability:**\n\n* **Short-Term Disability:**  Explore short-term disability through your employer (once the six-month waiting period is over).  You'll need a doctor's statement supporting your inability to work.\n\n* **Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI):**  While challenging under 50, SSDI is an option if your condition is severe and prevents you from working for at least 12 months.  The process is lengthy, so start gathering medical documentation now.  An attorney specializing in SSDI can be invaluable.\n\n\n**5.  Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Translation of Medical Records:**  Consider professional translation of your Mexican medical records.  This is crucial for your communication with US doctors and insurance companies.\n\n* **Neurologist Referral:**  Even before insurance is finalized, inquire with safety net clinics about referral to a neurologist in San Diego to obtain a second opinion regarding the brain cyst and seizure activity.\n\n* **Advocate:** If you struggle to navigate the bureaucracy, consider seeking help from a patient advocate or social worker.  Many hospitals and clinics have social work departments that can offer support.\n\n\n**In summary:**  Your situation is urgent, but don't despair.  Act decisively on all fronts:  seek immediate medical attention for the Keppra side effects and seizures, apply for all possible insurance and financial assistance programs, and contact the San Diego County HHSA immediately.  Your chances of getting help are significantly higher if you act proactively and document everything.  You are not alone; many people face similar challenges navigating the healthcare system.\n"

        "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're confused and concerned.  Having epilepsy for so long, and with the added complexities of strokes, brain surgery, and an autoimmune disorder, makes differentiating between different types of events incredibly challenging.  The fact that these episodes are happening *only* at work strongly suggests a possible non-epileptic cause, even with the familiar aura.\n\nLet's break down your questions:\n\n* **New manifestation of seizures?**  It's *possible*, but less likely given the exclusive workplace occurrence and the absence of a typical post-ictal headache. While seizures can certainly manifest differently over time, the focal twitching, breathing difficulty, and lack of the usual post-ictal state are not typical of a straightforward temporal lobe seizure progression.  The breathing difficulty is particularly important to note and warrants investigation.\n\n* **Non-epileptic seizures (NES) triggered by work stress?**  This is a very strong possibility.  NES are often triggered by psychological stress, and the workplace is a common trigger.  The aura you experience *could* be psychogenic\u2014meaning it's a neurological manifestation of stress rather than an epileptic pre-seizure event.  This isn't to say it isn't real or serious; it just has a different underlying cause.\n\n* **Do NES come with auras?** Yes, they can.  Auras in NES are often described as similar to those experienced in epileptic seizures.  This is a significant reason why differentiating between NES and epileptic seizures can be so difficult, even for specialists.\n\n* **Awareness during NES?**  This varies greatly. Some people are completely unaware of their NES, while others have some level of awareness, though they might not be able to control their actions or fully comprehend what's happening.  Your description suggests a level of awareness, which makes NES more probable than a seizure where consciousness is significantly impaired.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Document EVERYTHING:** Keep a detailed diary of these episodes.  Note the time, date, triggers (stressors at work), aura symptoms, the episode itself (duration, symptoms), and your feelings afterward.  This information is crucial for your doctor.\n\n2. **Return to your neurologist URGENTLY:** This is not something to manage on your own. Your neurologist needs to know about these new episodes and their context.  They may recommend:\n\n    * **Video-EEG monitoring:** This is the gold standard for diagnosing NES.  It involves wearing an EEG cap for a period (often several days) to record brain activity during an episode.\n    * **Psychological evaluation:** A psychologist or psychiatrist can assess your stress levels and mental health, which are crucial factors in NES.\n    * **Further investigations:**  Depending on the video-EEG findings and psychological assessment, additional tests (e.g., further neurological exams, cardiac tests to rule out cardiac causes of the breathing difficulties) might be necessary.\n\nIt's vital to rule out any serious underlying medical cause for the breathing difficulty. This is something your doctor needs to address.\n\nDon't feel embarrassed or silly about seeking help.  Changes in your seizure pattern or new symptoms are always a reason to seek medical attention.  Your history makes this situation even more critical, and finding the correct diagnosis and treatment is paramount for your health and well-being.\n"

        "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible that the anti-epileptic drugs you were taking for 14 years had an indirect, positive effect on your mood, and that their cessation contributed to your current mood swings.  Several anti-epileptic medications, including some you mentioned (like topiramate and lamotrigine), have mood-stabilizing properties and are sometimes used off-label to treat bipolar disorder or other mood disorders.  It's plausible that these medications were inadvertently helping manage aspects of your mood even if your seizures were non-epileptic.  The fact that your mood worsened significantly after stopping them supports this possibility.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to understand that:\n\n* **Correlation doesn't equal causation:** While the timing of your mood changes coincides with stopping the medication, this doesn't definitively prove the medications were the sole cause of your improved mood beforehand. Your endometriosis and PCOS can also significantly impact mood, and their underlying hormonal imbalances could be contributing factors to your current struggles.\n\n* **Multiple factors are at play:** Your current mental health challenges are likely complex and multifactorial.  The stress of dealing with chronic illnesses, financial difficulties, and the emotional impact of your suicide attempt all contribute to your current state.\n\n* **Withdrawal effects:**  Stopping anti-epileptic drugs abruptly can sometimes cause withdrawal symptoms, including mood changes.  It's possible you experienced a withdrawal effect which exacerbated any underlying mood disorder.\n\n**What to do:**\n\nGiven your recent serious mental health episode and significant mood swings, it's vital to seek professional help immediately.  A psychiatrist can:\n\n* **Assess your current mental health:** They can properly diagnose any underlying mood disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, depression with rapid cycling, etc.)  This is crucial for appropriate treatment.\n* **Evaluate the potential impact of the medication cessation:** They can consider whether the medication withdrawal played a role in your current symptoms.\n* **Develop a treatment plan:** This might involve medication (potentially including mood stabilizers or antidepressants different from Mirtazapine, as it seems to be insufficient for your needs), therapy (e.g., CBT or DBT), and lifestyle changes.\n\nDon't hesitate to share your complete medical history, including the details of your previous epilepsy treatment and the anti-epileptic drugs you took, with your psychiatrist. This information will be valuable in helping them understand your current situation and develop the most effective treatment strategy.  Your recent suicide attempt necessitates urgent professional intervention.  Please reach out to your doctor or mental health services immediately.\n"

        "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "answer": "This is a complex case requiring in-person medical evaluation.  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  However, I can offer some points to discuss with your doctors:\n\n**Key Points to Discuss with Your Healthcare Team:**\n\n* **Duration and Character of Headaches:**  Emphasize the 3+ month duration, the throbbing quality, location (right-sided, radiating), and the fact that they start upon waking and last until sleep.  The similarity to, but less intensity than, your previous migraines is crucial.\n* **Visual Auras:** The description of \"white flashing waves of light\" as an aura is significant and needs further investigation.  This suggests a possible neurological origin.\n* **Relationship to Epilepsy:**  The temporal relationship between migraines, essential tremor, and epilepsy is important. Your family history adds another layer to this.  Discuss the possibility of a shared underlying neurological cause.\n* **Medication Review:**  Your current medication regimen is extensive.  While some medications might contribute to headaches (though unlikely at your current doses for most of these), others are essential for epilepsy control.  A thorough review by your epileptologist is crucial to ensure there are no interactions or adverse effects causing headaches.  Discuss whether any medication adjustments might be beneficial.\n* **Kratom Use:**  Be completely open about your kratom use.  It's an opioid agonist and can have various side effects, including headaches.  Your doctors need this information to assess its role and potential interaction with other medications.\n* **Ibuprofen Use:**  While ibuprofen is useful for cubital tunnel,  its long-term use for headache management should be assessed as chronic use can have its own negative side effects.\n* **Differential Diagnoses:** Based on your description, possible diagnoses beyond migraines to discuss with your neurologists include:\n    * **Medication-induced headaches:**  Certain anti-epileptic drugs can cause headaches.\n    * **Secondary headaches:**  Headaches secondary to another underlying condition (e.g., related to your epilepsy, sleep apnea (even though improved), or another neurological issue).\n    * **Tension-type headaches with migrainous features:** This combines elements of both tension and migraine headaches.\n    * **New-onset migraine:** While you say migraines have decreased, the current headaches could represent a change in migraine pattern.\n\n\n**Specific Questions to Ask Your Doctors:**\n\n* Can we conduct further neurological testing (e.g., MRI, EEG) to rule out any structural abnormalities or other neurological causes of these headaches?\n* Could my current epilepsy medications be contributing to or exacerbating these headaches?\n* Should we consider adjusting my medication regimen to better manage both my epilepsy and headaches?\n* Is it safe to discontinue Kratom and if so, what would be the best strategy for withdrawal?\n* Would a headache diary, documenting frequency, intensity, location, associated symptoms (aura, nausea), and triggers, be helpful?\n* Should I seek a referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist given the visual auras?\n\n\n**Important Note:**  Do not stop or change any of your medications without first consulting your doctors.  The information provided here is for discussion purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  Your doctors need to assess you comprehensively to determine the best course of action.  The combination of epilepsy, a history of severe migraines, and persistent headaches requires a multidisciplinary approach.\n"

        "question": "This might be an odd one but I have had one seizure possibly (not confirmed but plausible) from other legally prescribed meds I was taking. I am on meds to control the seizures and have changed my diet,etc. I was wondering if I would be able to use a welder?

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "This is a question best answered by your neurologist and/or your primary care physician.  While you've been seizure-free for three years and take precautions, welding presents specific risks.\n\nThe potential dangers of welding related to your history include:\n\n* **Arc flash:**  The intense light and heat from an arc flash could trigger a seizure in a susceptible individual, even if unlikely.\n* **Falls:** A seizure while welding could lead to a fall, resulting in serious injury from the equipment or hot metal.\n* **Burns:**  Burns are a significant risk in welding, and a seizure could severely exacerbate the consequences.\n* **Exposure to fumes and gases:**  Welding fumes contain various potentially harmful substances.  While PPE mitigates this, a seizure could compromise its effectiveness.\n\nYour doctors can assess your current risk of seizure based on your medical history, medication regimen, and EEG (if you've had one). They can advise you on whether the risks associated with welding are acceptable given your individual circumstances.  They are in the best position to weigh the benefits against the potential dangers and give you a personalized recommendation.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What you're describing sounds very distressing, and it's definitely not typical sleep paralysis.  While sleep paralysis involves the inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up, the sensations you're experiencing \u2013 the brain \"rattling,\" \"zipping,\" hurricane-like feelings, magnetic sensations, and the apparent ability to influence the intensity through yes/no questions \u2013 go beyond the usual symptoms.\n\nSeveral possibilities need to be considered, and it's **crucial** to consult a medical professional:\n\n* **Underlying neurological condition:**  The sensations of a \"rattling\" or \"exploding\" brain, the intense pressure, and the unusual sensory experiences warrant a neurological evaluation.  This could potentially indicate a problem with brain function or blood flow, though it's important to note that this is just a possibility, not a diagnosis.\n\n* **Migraine or other headache disorder:**  The pressure and intense sensations could be related to migraine auras or other types of headaches.  Migraine auras can involve visual disturbances, sensory changes, and even neurological symptoms.\n\n* **Mental health condition:**  While not directly causing physical sensations, anxiety disorders or other mental health conditions can significantly worsen or amplify the experience of sleep paralysis and other sensory disturbances.  The feeling of control over the intensity via yes/no questions might be a manifestation of this.\n\n* **Sleep disorder other than sleep paralysis:**  You might have a different sleep disorder contributing to these symptoms.\n\n* **Medication side effects:**  Certain medications can cause unusual sensory experiences or neurological symptoms.\n\n**Do not attempt to self-diagnose.**  The combination of symptoms you've described is concerning and requires professional medical assessment.  \n\n**I strongly recommend:**\n\n1. **Scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician:** They can perform a preliminary assessment and order referrals to specialists as needed.\n2. **Keeping a detailed sleep diary:** Note the time of occurrence, the specific sensations, and any other relevant information about your sleep. This will be helpful for your doctor.\n3. **Being honest and thorough with your doctor:**  Describe all your symptoms in as much detail as possible.\n\nDelaying medical attention could be detrimental.  Your health is important, and seeking professional help is the best way to address these concerning symptoms and find appropriate treatment or management strategies.\n"

I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I\u2019m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn\u2019t have any \u201cepisodes\u201d yesterday, but couldn\u2019t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I\u2019m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr\u2019s that they might not be considering as an option.",

        "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're scared.  Facing a prolonged hospital stay with potentially unknown health issues while caring for a new baby is incredibly stressful.  Let's break down your situation and what you can expect.\n\n**What to Expect During the 5-Day EEG Observation:**\n\nThe 5-day EEG is designed to capture seizure activity that might not show up in shorter tests.  During this time:\n\n* **The EEG:**  Small electrodes will be attached to your scalp to monitor your brainwave activity.  This is generally painless, though it might feel a little strange.  You'll be able to move around somewhat, but the electrodes will need to stay in place.  They'll likely use a special adhesive, and you might experience some minor irritation or scalp tenderness afterward.\n* **Daily Life:**  The hospital will likely allow for some normal activity, depending on your condition and the monitoring needs.  You'll probably have regular check-ins with the medical staff.\n* **Sleep:** They'll want to monitor your sleep patterns as seizures can often occur during sleep or immediately upon waking.  Get good rest before you go.\n* **Visitors:** Check the hospital's visitor policy, especially regarding your baby.  Hospitals usually have policies to protect both the patients and young children from infection.  You may be able to have limited visitors or have your partner help with the baby.\n* **Food/Medications:**  Follow the hospital's dietary guidelines.  Continue taking your Tylenol for pain as directed, but inform the hospital staff about all medication, including over-the-counter drugs.  They might want to temporarily stop some medications for accuracy during testing.\n\n**Tests After Epilepsy is Ruled Out:**\n\nIf the EEG remains inconclusive and epilepsy is ruled out, the doctors will likely consider a wide range of possibilities. This could include:\n\n* **More Detailed Neurological Exam:**  A more thorough assessment of your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, and sensory function.\n* **Neuroimaging (MRI or CT Scan):** To check for structural abnormalities in the brain that could cause these episodes.\n* **Blood Tests:**  To rule out metabolic disorders, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying medical conditions.\n* **Autonomic Nervous System Testing:**  Tests to assess the function of your autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.  This is because some conditions affecting this system can mimic seizures.\n* **Cardiac Testing:**  To rule out cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) that might contribute to dizziness and fainting spells.\n* **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Although your depression and anxiety are noted,  a more thorough evaluation is necessary since they can interact with the other symptoms.  There are conditions like conversion disorder which could be causing these episodes.\n\n**Other Options & Things to Bring Up to Your Doctor:**\n\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**  This is a condition where seizure-like episodes occur due to psychological factors rather than neurological problems.  Your history of anxiety and depression, along with the variability of your symptoms, makes this a possible consideration.  Make sure your doctor discusses this with you.\n* **Specific Symptoms:** The timing of the seizures, especially in relation to stress (baby care) and sleep.  The specific \"stabbing pain\" deserves more attention as a potential clue.  Explain what triggers the episodes and how your symptoms impact daily life.\n* **Vascular Problems:** Although less likely, unusual vascular anomalies or small aneurysms in the brain could be explored, especially given the \"head smack\" sensation.\n* **Migraines:**  Some migraine variants can present with focal neurological symptoms and might be confused with seizures.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder:** A condition where neurological symptoms (like weakness, paralysis, seizures) are real, but not caused by a specific neurological disease. It's linked to stress and psychological factors.\n\n\n**Passing the Time During the 5-Day EEG:**\n\n* **Books/eBooks/Audiobooks:**  These are great for passing the time, but check if the EEG monitoring equipment will interfere with certain devices.\n* **Movies/TV Shows:** Download or bring plenty of entertainment.\n* **Hobbies:**  Bring portable crafts like knitting, crocheting, or adult coloring books.\n* **Journaling:** This can help you track your symptoms and process your emotions.\n* **Meditation/Relaxation Apps:** These can help manage stress and anxiety.\n\n**Tips for the Hospital Stay:**\n\n* **Packing:** Pack comfortable clothes, pajamas, toiletries, and any medications you're allowed to take.  Bring snacks that are easy to eat, as hospital food can be unpredictable.\n* **Support System:**  Let family and friends know what's going on and arrange for help with your baby, if possible.\n* **Communicate:** Don't hesitate to talk to the medical staff about your fears, concerns, and any changes in your symptoms.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for general knowledge and discussion only.  The information provided should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.  You *must* discuss all of your concerns and symptoms with your doctors.  They will be able to conduct the necessary tests and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan.

        "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",

        "answer": "You're facing a complex situation with potentially overlapping causes for your difficulties.  To figure out the best course of action, and to avoid unnecessary expense, a phased approach is recommended:\n\n**Phase 1: Neuropsychological Evaluation**\n\nA comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is the best starting point. This type of testing can:\n\n* **Assess cognitive function:** It will pinpoint specific areas of cognitive impairment (memory, attention, executive function, etc.)  This helps differentiate between PTSD-related cognitive difficulties and those potentially stemming from the epilepsy.\n* **Differentiate between PTSD and neurological deficits:** The evaluation will help determine the relative contribution of PTSD and any potential lingering neurological effects from your epilepsy and head injury.  A skilled neuropsychologist can design tests to isolate these factors.\n* **Inform treatment:**  The results will guide treatment recommendations, including whether further neurological investigations are needed.\n\n**Phase 2: Neurology Consult (If Indicated)**\n\nBased on the neuropsychological evaluation, your neurologist might recommend:\n\n* **Further EEG:** While your recent EEG was normal,  the neuropsychologist might suggest another, particularly if cognitive testing points toward neurological issues.  Sometimes subtle problems aren't picked up on standard EEGs.\n* **MRI:** An MRI of the brain could help rule out structural abnormalities that might be contributing to your symptoms. This would be particularly useful if there are indications of persistent neurological impact from past seizures or the head injury.\n* **Other tests:** Depending on the neuropsychological findings, other tests may be recommended.\n\n**Phase 3: Pain Center and Stellate Ganglion Block (If Appropriate)**\n\nOnly *after* the neuropsychological evaluation and neurological consultation should you consider the pain center and the stellate ganglion block. This procedure is invasive and should only be considered if other avenues have been explored and if the evaluation points towards a strong likelihood of benefiting from it.  The pain center likely won't consider this procedure until your other issues are better understood.\n\n\n**Long-Term Consequences of Epilepsy:**\n\nThe long-term consequences of your epilepsy history depend on several factors, including:\n\n* **Severity and duration of seizures:** Your early history was severe, but the fact that you haven't had seizures for many years is positive.\n* **Areas of the brain affected:**  The left temporal lobe involvement is significant, as that area plays a role in memory, language, and emotional processing.  However, your normal recent EEG suggests a good prognosis.\n* **Individual variation:**  People respond differently to brain injuries and illnesses.\n\nPossible long-term consequences could include subtle cognitive difficulties (memory problems, attention deficits, executive dysfunction), mood disturbances (anxiety, depression), and even personality changes.  The neuropsychological evaluation will help determine the extent to which these are present in your case.\n\n**Likelihood of Being \"in the Clear\":**\n\nGiven your normal recent EEG and lack of seizures for many years, the likelihood of having another seizure is significantly reduced.  However, it's not zero.  Your neurologist can provide a more precise assessment of your risk based on your evaluation.\n\n**In summary:**  Start with the neuropsychological evaluation.  This is the most efficient and cost-effective way to determine the underlying causes of your difficulties and guide your treatment.  Only then should you proceed with neurological consultations and consider the stellate ganglion block.  Don't jump to the most expensive and invasive options before exhausting less invasive investigations.\n"

        "answer": "I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  It's crucial to discuss your concerns about HRT and its potential interaction with your epilepsy medications with your neurologist and your endocrinologist (the doctor who will manage your HRT).  They are the best qualified to assess your individual risk.\n\nWhile some epilepsy medications *can* interact with HRT, the specifics depend on many factors, including the individual patient's response, the specific HRT regimen (type and dose of estrogen and/or progesterone), and the specific epilepsy medication(s).  There isn't a definitive yes or no answer for your situation without a thorough medical evaluation.\n\nYour neurologist will be able to review your current medication regimen (Depakote and Keppra) and consider the potential effects of adding HRT. They might monitor your EEG or seizure frequency more closely during the initiation of HRT.  Your endocrinologist will work with you to develop the best HRT plan, and they can collaborate with your neurologist to minimize risks.\n\n**Do not start or stop any medications, including HRT, without first consulting your doctors.**  Changing your medication regimen without professional guidance can be dangerous.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n* **Schedule appointments:** Make appointments with both your neurologist and an endocrinologist specializing in gender-affirming care.\n* **Detailed discussion:**  Discuss your concerns about seizure activity increasing with HRT. Bring a complete list of all your medications, supplements, and any known seizure triggers.\n* **Shared decision-making:**  Work collaboratively with your doctors to create a plan that considers your epilepsy management and your gender transition goals.

        "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling scared, frustrated, and depressed given your situation.  While you've been diagnosed with epilepsy, your description of your symptoms and their progression strongly suggests that your current experience may be more complex than simple absence seizures, and that the diagnosis may need to be re-evaluated.\n\nSeveral aspects of your description raise concerns:\n\n* **Discrepancy between EEG findings and subjective experience:** Normal EEG results despite experiencing significant debilitating symptoms are a major red flag.  Absence seizures are often (but not always) detectable on EEG.  The fact that your EEGs are consistently normal while your symptoms worsen significantly casts doubt on the diagnosis of solely absence seizures.\n* **Symptom progression:**  The worsening of your symptoms, including increased frequency, duration, and the addition of new symptoms (increased light and noise sensitivity, memory loss) strongly suggests something beyond a stable epilepsy diagnosis.\n* **Nature of the episodes:** Your description (\"my world started looking weird...everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange...I couldn't react\") points towards altered perception and consciousness which might indicate a different neurological condition or a co-occurring condition. This sounds more like a dissociative episode or a complex neurological event than a typical absence seizure.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion:**  Immediately request a consultation with a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and complex neurological conditions.  Bring all your medical records, including EEG results and medication history. Emphasize the discrepancy between your symptoms and the normal EEG findings.\n2. **Detailed symptom diary:** Keep a detailed diary recording the frequency, duration, and specific details of your episodes. Note any triggers (light, noise, stress, sleep deprivation) and any associated symptoms (memory loss, altered perception, emotional changes). This detailed information will be invaluable for your new neurologist.\n3. **Consider alternative diagnoses:**  Based on your description, conditions like:\n    * **Dissociative disorders:**  These involve disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, and perception.\n    * **Complex partial seizures:** These are seizures that can involve a wider range of neurological and psychological symptoms than absence seizures.\n    * **Other neurological conditions:** There are various conditions that could cause similar symptoms.\n    * **Medication side effects:** While less likely given the worsening of symptoms, it's important to rule this out.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated and worried.  It's been a long journey with unanswered questions, and the worsening frequency and changing circumstances of your episodes are concerning.  While I cannot provide a diagnosis (only a medical professional can do that), I can offer some insights and suggestions to help you navigate the next two months:\n\n**Regarding your concerns:**\n\n* **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):**  The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, surreal feeling, and short-term memory issues are suggestive of a temporal lobe origin.  The fact that your pauses are seen on the loop recorder, however, does initially point more towards a cardiac cause.  The combination of cardiac pauses *and* neurological symptoms makes this a complex case requiring careful investigation.  Sinus pauses are *not* a typical finding in epilepsy, but atypical presentations certainly exist, and it's not impossible.\n\n* **Hormonal Influence:** The correlation with your menstrual cycle is significant and warrants attention.  Hormonal fluctuations can affect both the cardiovascular and nervous systems.  A neurologist specializing in epilepsy or a neuroendocrinologist would be well-suited to explore this connection.\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** While your cardiologists initially attributed your symptoms to vasovagal syncope, the consistent pattern of pauses (5-13 seconds), the preceding d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and the increasing frequency argue against a simple vasovagal explanation.  Vasovagal syncope typically doesn't involve such prolonged pauses or the neurological symptoms you're describing.\n\n* **Progressive Memory Issues:** The worsening memory, especially regarding recent events, is an important red flag and needs thorough investigation.  This could be related to the fainting episodes themselves (causing minor brain injury with repeated events), or a separate underlying neurological condition.\n\n\n**What you can do in the next two months:**\n\n1. **Detailed Diary:** Keep a meticulously detailed diary of your episodes. Note:\n    * **Time of day:** Precise time of each episode.\n    * **Position:** Exact position (sitting, standing, lying down).\n    * **Premonitory symptoms:**  Details of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, surreal feeling, and any other sensations preceding the episode.  Are there any subtle changes in vision or hearing beforehand?\n    * **Duration of pause/loss of consciousness:**  As accurate as possible.\n    * **Post-episode symptoms:**  Duration and severity of each symptom (fogginess, memory issues, coldness, digestive problems).\n    * **Menstrual cycle:**  Mark your menstrual cycle phases.\n    * **Stress levels:**  Your assessment of stress levels before the episode (even if generally low).\n    * **Activities:** What were you doing immediately before the episode?\n    * **Food & Drink:**  What you had recently consumed.\n\n\n2. **Wearable Monitoring:**  If you have a smartwatch or fitness tracker that monitors heart rate, keep an eye on the data around the time of episodes. This might reveal subtle patterns even if the loop recorder doesn't capture everything.\n\n\n3. **Medication Review:**  Make a list of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n\n\n4. **Prepare for Neurologist:** Write down all your symptoms, their chronology, and any patterns you observe. Bring your diary and this list to your appointment.  Be prepared to discuss the possibility of TLE, hormonal influences, and the limitations of the existing cardiac explanations.\n\n\n5. **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't hesitate to express your concerns and advocate for further investigations.  Explain that the current management isn't working and that the worsening symptoms are worrying you.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  While waiting for the neurologist, avoid driving or operating machinery during times you might be at risk of an episode.  Also, let your family and close friends know about your symptoms and what to do if you experience an episode.\n\n\nThis situation requires a multidisciplinary approach. The combination of cardiac pauses and neurological symptoms needs careful evaluation by both cardiologists and neurologists who can collaborate to understand the root cause.  The detailed diary will be invaluable in helping your specialists pinpoint potential triggers and patterns.  Be persistent and don't give up on finding answers.\n"

        "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling scared and overwhelmed.  What you're describing sounds like it could be sleep paralysis, but some of the symptoms, particularly the electrical sensations and the potential for out-of-body experiences, warrant further investigation to rule out other possibilities.  While sleep paralysis itself isn't dangerous, the intense sensations you describe could be indicative of something else.  The fact that sleep deprivation seems to trigger it further complicates things.\n\n**It's absolutely crucial to see a doctor as soon as possible.**  While you have legitimate concerns about COVID and your immunocompromised family, the potential for a more serious underlying condition makes delaying medical attention risky.  Even if you can't go to a doctor's office immediately, explore these options:\n\n* **Telemedicine:** Many doctors offer virtual appointments. This allows for a consultation without needing to physically go to a clinic.  This might be a good starting point to discuss your symptoms and get advice.\n* **Urgent Care (if absolutely necessary):**  If you experience a particularly severe episode, go to an urgent care clinic. Explain your situation and your concerns about your family. They can assess your immediate needs and potentially give you referrals.\n* **Free or Low-Cost Clinics:** Check online for resources in your area that provide healthcare for low-income individuals.  These clinics may offer services even without insurance.\n\n**What you're describing *could* be:**\n\n* **Sleep Paralysis:** The majority of your symptoms align with this.\n* **Sleep Apnea (possibly exacerbating sleep paralysis):** Your elevated sleep position suggests you're already aware of potential apnea.  This condition can disrupt sleep and trigger other issues.\n* **Other Neurological Conditions:** The electrical sensations and out-of-body experiences are less typical for sleep paralysis and require medical evaluation to rule out conditions like complex partial seizures, migraines with aura, or other neurological issues.\n\n**Keeping a detailed sleep diary is extremely helpful:**  Note down:\n\n* **Date and time of episodes:**\n* **Specific symptoms:** Describe each symptom in detail (the buzzing, electrical sensations, floating, sounds, etc.).  Use a rating scale (1-10) for pain and intensity.\n* **Sleep quality leading up to the episode:** Hours slept, quality of sleep, stress levels.\n* **Triggering factors:**  Sleep deprivation, stress, caffeine/alcohol intake.\n\nThis diary will be incredibly valuable for a doctor to review and make a diagnosis.\n\n**In the meantime:**\n\n* **Prioritize sleep hygiene:**  Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n* **Manage stress:** Stress can worsen sleep paralysis. Explore relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n* **Avoid sleep deprivation:** This is a major trigger.  Even if you\u2019re afraid of the episodes, aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep.  If severe sleep deprivation is part of the cycle, you need medical intervention.\n\n**It's important to remember:**  You are not alone, and there is help available.

So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",

        "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing some concerning neurological symptoms.  The episodes you describe, including the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, dizziness, headaches, temporary memory loss, and episodes of altered awareness/dissociation, warrant a thorough medical evaluation.  The fact that these symptoms are accompanied by significant memory gaps, particularly after the car accident, is especially important.  Your concern about a brain tumor or epilepsy is understandable given these symptoms.\n\n**You should seek immediate medical attention.**  This is not something that can be diagnosed or treated safely over the internet.  You need to see a doctor, preferably a neurologist, as soon as possible.\n\nHere's why immediate medical attention is crucial:\n\n* **Memory Loss:**  The significant memory loss after the car accident is a red flag.  It could be related to a concussion, but other serious conditions need to be ruled out.\n* **Altered Awareness:** The episodes where you don't recognize people and feel disoriented suggest a possible seizure or other neurological event.\n* **Recurring Episodes:** The fact that these episodes are recurring indicates a pattern that needs investigation.\n* **Car Accident:** The car accident itself, even without injuries, is a significant event that needs to be assessed within the context of your other symptoms.\n\nWhile your friend suggested an aura before an epileptic seizure, only a neurologist can accurately diagnose this or any other potential neurological condition.  They will likely conduct a physical exam, neurological exam, and may order imaging tests like an MRI or EEG to get a clearer picture of what's happening.\n\n**Do not delay seeking medical care.**  Your symptoms are serious and require professional assessment and treatment.  Explain all your symptoms in detail to the doctor, including the frequency, duration, and any triggers you may have noticed.  The more information you provide, the better they can help you.\n"

        "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're anxious about your upcoming flight given your history of fainting.  While your doctors have ruled out some common causes, the fact that it happens primarily on airplanes and is linked to specific triggers (heat, dehydration, possibly postural changes) suggests a few possibilities that may not have been fully explored, or warrant further investigation.  The fact that it happens on both land and air also makes it harder to pinpoint a single cause.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential areas to consider and advice for your upcoming flight:\n\n**Possible Contributing Factors (Beyond What's Been Ruled Out):**\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the most likely explanation.  Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting triggered by a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate.  Several factors on airplanes can contribute:\n    * **Dehydration:**  Airplanes are notoriously dehydrating environments. Even with your current water intake, you might need more, especially given your size and the length of the flight.\n    * **Low Blood Pressure:**  A combination of dehydration, heat, and potentially long periods of sitting can cause a drop in blood pressure, triggering a vasovagal episode.\n    * **Postural Changes:**  Getting up suddenly from a seated position can also trigger a drop in blood pressure.\n    * **Stress and Anxiety:**  The stress of flying, especially alone and knowing you've fainted before, can significantly worsen vasovagal syncope.  This is a vicious cycle \u2013 anxiety increases the risk, and past fainting increases anxiety.\n    * **Hypothyroidism:** While your Synthroid is managing your thyroid, subtle hormonal imbalances can influence blood pressure regulation and increase susceptibility to fainting.  It's worth discussing with your endocrinologist whether your dosage or other aspects of your thyroid management might be optimized.\n\n\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  This is a form of low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up quickly.  The airplane environment, combined with potential dehydration, could make this worse.\n\n\n* **Medication Interactions (less likely):** Although unlikely given your thorough medical history, it's worth mentioning that very rarely, medications can interact in unexpected ways to cause these symptoms.  Mention your Synthroid and any other medications to your doctor to rule out this possibility completely.\n\n\n**Recommendations for Your 14-Hour Flight:**\n\n1. **Maximize Hydration:**  Your 64 oz target is a good start, but consider increasing it.  Start hydrating heavily *before* the flight.  Drink consistently throughout the flight.  Electrolyte drinks (like Pedialyte) might be more effective than just water in preventing dehydration. Avoid alcohol entirely.\n2. **Salt Intake:**  Continue with salt tablets, but also consider salty snacks (pretzels, nuts) to help with blood pressure regulation.\n3. **Compression Socks:**  Excellent choice.\n4. **Frequent Movement:**  Get up and walk around the cabin *every* hour or two, even if it's just to the lavatory. Avoid sudden movements.\n5. **Compression Stockings:**  Very good idea and continue doing so.\n6. **Elevated Legs:**  When seated, try to elevate your legs whenever possible. This can help prevent blood pooling.\n7. **Avoid Alcohol & Caffeine:**  You're already doing this \u2013 continue!\n8. **Hydration & Diet:**  Eat small, frequent, high-protein meals and snacks to prevent blood sugar fluctuations.\n9. **Comfortable Seating:**  If possible, request an aisle seat to make getting up easier.\n10. **Inform Flight Attendants:**  Let them know about your history.  They can be more responsive and supportive if an incident occurs.\n11. **Medical Alert Bracelet:** Wear a medical alert bracelet that states you have a history of syncope.\n12. **Medication:** If your doctor approves and deems it necessary, you could speak to them about taking a medication, like fludrocortisone to help treat orthostatic hypotension. Discuss any medication options thoroughly with your doctor.\n13. **Mental Preparation:**  Practice relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation) before and during the flight to manage stress and anxiety.\n\n**Further Medical Investigation (Consider Discussing with Your Doctor):**\n\n* **Tilt-Table Test:** This test measures blood pressure and heart rate changes when you change positions.  It can be helpful in diagnosing vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension.\n* **24-hour Holter Monitor:** This records your heart rhythm for 24 hours, helping identify any irregularities.\n* **Review of Thyroid Function:**  As mentioned, a discussion with your endocrinologist about your Synthroid dosage and thyroid function is crucial to rule out any contribution from your hypothyroidism.\n\n\nIt's vital that you discuss these recommendations and further investigations with your doctor. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific case and medical history.  Don't dismiss your fainting episodes as \"sometimes girls faint.\"  Persistent fainting requires thorough investigation.  Your safety and comfort during your flight are paramount.\n"

        "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're frustrated and searching for answers.  Your experience is complex, and it's not surprising that neither online communities nor your doctors seem to fully grasp the interplay between your epilepsy, weight changes, and energy levels.\n\nLet's break down your concerns:\n\n* **Keppra and Energy:** While fatigue is a common side effect of Keppra, your drastic energy shift seems beyond typical side effects.  It's possible the Keppra is contributing, but it's unlikely to be the sole cause of such a profound change in your fitness capabilities.\n\n* **Epilepsy and Autoimmune Disease:** There's a complex relationship between epilepsy and autoimmune diseases.  Some autoimmune conditions can *increase the risk* of epilepsy, and vice versa.  However, having epilepsy doesn't automatically mean you have an autoimmune disease. The link isn't always clear-cut.  Further investigation might be needed to explore this possibility.\n\n* **Weight Loss and Epilepsy:**  Significant weight loss before the seizure could be a coincidence, or it could be related to an underlying issue that also contributed to the epilepsy.  Again, more investigation is needed.\n\n* **Doctors' Dismissal:**  It's infuriating when medical professionals dismiss your concerns.  Their approach is unfortunately common, particularly when weight is involved.  However, it's crucial to find healthcare providers who will listen attentively and thoroughly investigate your concerns.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Find a Neurologist Specializing in Epilepsy:**  You need a neurologist with expertise in epilepsy who is willing to consider all aspects of your health.  Explain your history in detail, emphasizing the timeline of events and the drastic change in your energy levels.\n\n2. **Advocate for Comprehensive Testing:**  Ask your neurologist for blood tests to check for things like:\n    * **Thyroid function:** Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue.\n    * **Vitamin deficiencies:**  B vitamins, vitamin D, etc., are crucial for energy levels.\n    * **Inflammatory markers:**  These could indicate an underlying autoimmune condition.\n    * **Comprehensive metabolic panel:** To check for other potential underlying medical issues.\n\n3. **Consider a Referral to a Gastroenterologist:** If you suspect leaky gut, your neurologist can refer you to a gastroenterologist for testing and treatment.  However, treat this as a *possible* factor, not the primary explanation.\n\n4. **Keep a Detailed Journal:** Track your energy levels, medications, diet, sleep, and any other relevant factors. This detailed information can be invaluable when discussing your condition with doctors.\n\n5. **Don't Give Up:**  Finding the right diagnosis and treatment can take time and persistence.  Don't be afraid to seek second opinions.  Your experience is valid, and you deserve answers.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. The information above is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.  You must consult with qualified healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment.\n"

        "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible to give a diagnosis based on this description.  Your experience is concerning and warrants the neurologist appointment you already have scheduled.  However, I can offer some possible explanations for what you've described, keeping in mind this is *not* a diagnosis, only speculation:\n\n* **Adverse Reaction to Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas):**  While rare, severe reactions to nitrous oxide are possible.  Your initial experience and subsequent symptoms suggest a potential delayed adverse reaction. This could manifest as neurological symptoms due to its effect on the central nervous system.  The delayed onset is a significant factor here.\n\n* **Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Disorder):**  This is a condition where neurological symptoms like paralysis, seizures, or sensory loss occur without a clear underlying neurological cause. The symptoms are real and distressing but are thought to be related to psychological stress or trauma, often triggered by a stressful event.  Your experience with the laughing gas, the overwhelming sensations, and the subsequent episodes could be interpreted in this context.  Note that this does *not* mean you are \"making it up\"; it's a genuine medical condition with a neurological presentation but a non-neurological basis.\n\n* **Other Neurological Conditions (Less Likely Given the Timeline and Lack of Family History):** While less probable given the sudden onset and seeming link to the nitrous oxide, other neurological conditions *could* be considered, but would require extensive testing to rule out or confirm.\n\n* **Anxiety or Panic Disorder (Despite History):** While you deny a history of anxiety, the severe initial reaction to the laughing gas could have triggered an underlying predisposition or even induced an anxiety disorder.  The subsequent \"freezes\" and processing difficulties could be manifestations of panic or anxiety-related symptoms.  It's worth considering that a severe event can trigger a new disorder, even if there's no prior history.\n\n**What to do before your neurologist appointment:**\n\n* **Keep a detailed journal:**  Document the frequency, duration, and circumstances of your freezing episodes and processing difficulties.  Note any triggers or preceding events. This will be invaluable for your neurologist.\n* **Avoid nitrous oxide:**  This is crucial until the cause of your symptoms is determined.\n* **Prepare a list of questions:**  Bring a comprehensive list of questions for your neurologist. Be specific about the timing of your symptoms in relation to the dental procedure.\n\n**Your neurologist will likely perform:**\n\n* **A thorough neurological examination:** Assessing reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n* **Further investigations:**  This may include an EEG (to detect abnormal brain activity), MRI (to examine brain structure), or other tests depending on their findings.\n\nIt's vital to emphasize that you need a professional medical assessment.  The information provided here is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  Do not attempt to self-diagnose or treat.

        "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Birth asphyxia, or lack of oxygen during birth, can indeed lead to a range of neurological and developmental issues.  While it's impossible for me to diagnose you, it's understandable you're exploring the connection between your birth experience and your current conditions (ADHD/ADD and light sensitivity).\n\nHere's what we know about potential long-term effects of birth asphyxia:\n\n* **Neurological Damage:**  The brain is highly susceptible to oxygen deprivation.  Severe birth asphyxia can cause damage to various brain regions, leading to a wide spectrum of problems.  The severity depends on the duration and severity of oxygen deprivation.\n\n* **Cerebral Palsy:** This is a significant potential consequence of severe birth asphyxia, affecting muscle movement and coordination.\n\n* **Intellectual Disability:**  In severe cases, birth asphyxia can impact cognitive development.\n\n* **Seizures:**  As you mentioned, seizures are a possible complication, particularly in cases of significant brain injury.\n\n* **ADHD/ADD:**  A link between birth asphyxia and ADHD/ADD has been explored in research, but the evidence isn't conclusive. While some studies suggest a correlation, it's not definitively proven that birth asphyxia *causes* ADHD/ADD.  Many factors contribute to ADHD/ADD, including genetics and environmental influences.\n\n* **Light Sensitivity (Photosensitivity):**  This can be a symptom of various neurological conditions. While a direct link to birth asphyxia isn't consistently established,  brain injury from any cause can sometimes lead to such sensitivities.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Severity of Asphyxia:** The severity of oxygen deprivation during your birth significantly impacts the likelihood and severity of long-term consequences.  Your parents' description suggests a serious event requiring immediate cooling measures, but without medical records, the exact severity is difficult to determine.\n\n* **Other Factors:**  Many factors contribute to ADHD/ADD and other developmental conditions.  Genetics, environmental influences, and other medical factors often play a role.  Birth asphyxia may be one factor among many.\n\n* **Medical Evaluation:** To understand the potential link between your birth asphyxia and your current conditions, it's crucial to consult with a neurologist or developmental pediatrician. They can review your history, conduct a thorough examination, and possibly order tests to assess your neurological function.  They can also provide a more accurate assessment of the potential connection.\n\n\nIt's understandable to seek answers and connections, but remember that correlation doesn't equal causation.  A medical professional can offer the most accurate assessment and guidance.  Bringing your parents' account of your birth and your current concerns to a doctor is the best next step. They can help you find the appropriate support and care.\n"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned, especially given the combination of symptoms and your recent stressful experience.  While stress can absolutely exacerbate existing conditions and cause a range of physical and cognitive symptoms, the combination of phantom smells, eye floaters, flashing lights, and other neurological symptoms warrants further investigation beyond a simple assessment of stress levels.\n\nLet's address your concerns point by point:\n\n* **Phantom Smells (Olfactory Hallucinations):**  While stress can sometimes contribute to unusual sensory experiences, these were significant enough to warrant the EEG. The negative result for temporal lobe epilepsy is reassuring, but other neurological causes need to be considered.\n\n* **Eye Floaters and Flashing Lights:** These are concerning and could be indicative of several things, including retinal issues (e.g., retinal tear or detachment), migraines, or less commonly, issues related to the brain.  This needs a thorough ophthalmological examination.\n\n* **High-Pitched Noise in Ear (Tinnitus):** Stress can worsen tinnitus, but it's important to rule out other causes through an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) evaluation.\n\n* **Muscle Twitching, Headaches, Lightheadedness:** These are common symptoms associated with stress and anxiety, but also have numerous other potential causes.\n\n* **Cognitive Symptoms (Word-Finding Difficulty, Loss of Train of Thought, Feeling Disconnected):**  Stress and anxiety heavily impact cognitive function.  However, persistent cognitive changes necessitate a more thorough neurological evaluation.\n\n* **Tooth Decay:**  While unrelated to your neurological symptoms, the decaying tooth should be addressed by a dentist as infections can sometimes have systemic effects.\n\n**Why your GP's lack of concern might not be reassuring:**  It's crucial to remember that GPs are general practitioners. While they are trained to recognize serious conditions, neurological issues often require specialist input (neurologist or ophthalmologist).  A negative EEG is a good step, but it doesn't rule out all possibilities.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **See an Ophthalmologist:** The eye floaters and flashing lights are a priority. They need to be examined immediately to rule out serious retinal issues.\n\n2. **See a Neurologist:**  Given the persistence and combination of neurological symptoms (phantom smells, even if infrequent now, cognitive changes), a neurologist should perform a comprehensive neurological examination.  This may include further imaging (MRI) to assess for structural abnormalities.\n\n3. **Follow Up with your GP:**  Discuss your concerns with your GP, specifically emphasizing the ophthalmologist and neurologist referrals.  Provide them with a detailed timeline of your symptoms.\n\n4. **Address Anxiety and Depression:**  Continue addressing your mental health.  Therapy and possibly medication can help manage stress and its physical manifestations.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "A hickie, or a love bite, is not inherently dangerous.  It's just broken blood vessels under the skin caused by sucking or vigorous kissing.  The discoloration and bruising are temporary.\n\nThe scary things people are saying are vastly exaggerated.  You will *not* die from a hickie.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor considerations:\n\n* **Infection:**  If the person who gave you the hickie has any mouth sores or infections, there's a *small* risk of infection at the site.  Keep it clean and watch for any signs of infection (increased pain, swelling, redness, pus).  If you see any of these, see a doctor.\n\n* **Epilepsy and Anxiety:**  While a hickie itself won't trigger a seizure or anxiety attack, the stress of the situation or the concern about it *could*. If the worry about the hickie is causing you significant anxiety, talk to your doctor or a trusted adult.  They can help you manage your anxiety.\n\n* **Appearance:** Some people are self-conscious about the appearance of a hickie.  This is a purely cosmetic concern, and the bruise will fade within a week or two.\n\nIn short, don't worry about dying from a hickie.  It's a minor bruise. Focus on keeping it clean and managing any anxiety it might be causing you. If you have concerns about infection or any other symptoms, consult a doctor.\n"

No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

        "answer": "It's understandable you're concerned.  Your symptoms warrant a doctor's visit, especially given your pre-existing conditions and family history of cancer.  While some symptoms might seem like typical hormonal fluctuations or depression, the combination, particularly the dark urine and very light periods, requires professional evaluation.  Delaying this could be detrimental.\n\nHere's why a doctor's visit is justified and what to focus on when you do:\n\n**Key Reasons for Immediate Doctor's Visit:**\n\n* **Dark Urine:**  This is a significant flag, suggesting potential dehydration (unlikely given your water intake) or a problem with kidney function or liver function.  It's not normal and needs investigation.\n* **Very Light or Absent Periods:**  Combined with the dark urine and your history of endometriosis and ovarian cyst, this is a crucial warning sign. It could be related to hormonal imbalances, the cyst itself, or something more serious.  The fact your periods were previously heavy makes the change even more concerning.\n* **Increased Ovarian Pain:** The increased pain and tenderness around your 5cm cyst require monitoring, especially given its size and growth history.  While unlikely, the possibility of torsion (twisting) or rupture needs to be ruled out.\n* **Persistent Flu-like Symptoms:** Recurring colds and flu-like symptoms within a short period suggest a weakened immune system or an underlying condition.\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctor:**\n\n* **Detailed Timeline:** Clearly describe when each symptom started and how it has progressed.  Mention the gradual decrease in period flow and the recent change in urine color.\n* **All Medications and Supplements:**  Include dosages and frequency of Lamotrigine, Ibuprofen, Concerta (even though infrequent), melatonin (past use), and the newly started Vitamin D.  Smoking cessation efforts are also relevant.\n* **Family History:** Be specific about your family's cancer history. This will influence the doctor's recommendations for further testing.\n* **Ovarian Cyst Details:** Explain the history of the cyst, its growth, and the increased pain you're experiencing.\n* **Lifestyle Changes:** Mention the recent move and any associated stress.  Discuss changes in diet, exercise, and smoking habits.\n\n**What the Doctor Might Do:**\n\n* **Physical Exam:**  To assess your overall health and check for any abnormalities.\n* **Blood Tests:** To check your kidney and liver function, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid levels, hormone levels (including reproductive hormones), and possibly a tumor marker test.\n* **Urinalysis:** To analyze your urine for any infections or abnormalities.\n* **Pelvic Ultrasound:** To re-evaluate the ovarian cyst and check for any other abnormalities.\n* **Further Imaging:** Depending on the initial results, they might order a CT scan or MRI.\n\n**Don't Dismiss Your Concerns:**\n\nWhile you're right to avoid unnecessary doctor visits, dismissing persistent symptoms, especially given your medical history, is not advisable. The combination of symptoms you're experiencing warrants prompt medical attention.  In Norway, you have access to excellent healthcare. Don't hesitate to utilize it.  It's better to be thorough and have peace of mind than to regret delaying a potentially important diagnosis.\n"

        "question": "I\u2019m (40F) 5ft 8, 164lbs, caucasian. Medications: Lamotrigine and Sertraline Health conditions: ADHD, Tourette\u2019s, epilepsy and severe degenerative disc disease. I don\u2019t have a current issue but every time I\u2019ve had surgery I wake up completely full of beans, even when I\u2019ve just woken up in recovery. I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can\u2019t stop giggling. I don\u2019t feel sick at all and always want water and food immediately. Drs/nurses etc have commented it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even have surgery, but I\u2019ve never asked if there\u2019s a reason why. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I\u2019ve never been told I\u2019m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's fascinating that you experience this post-surgical hyperactivity!  While I can't provide a diagnosis, I can offer some potential explanations for your unusual response to surgery and anesthesia:\n\n* **Stress Response and Adrenaline:**  Your body might be releasing a massive surge of adrenaline and other stress hormones in response to the surgery, even after the procedure is complete. This could explain the hyperactivity, increased energy, and lack of immediate pain.  The body's natural stress response can mask pain temporarily.\n\n* **Individual Variation in Anesthesia Metabolism:** Your body might metabolize anesthetics differently than average. This could explain why codeine is ineffective and you require extra anesthetic at the dentist.  This faster metabolism could also lead to a quicker \"awakening\" from the effects of anesthesia, resulting in your immediate hyperactivity.  Genetic factors play a large role in how individuals metabolize drugs.\n\n* **Lamotrigine and Sertraline Interaction:** While less likely, it's possible that the interaction of your medications (Lamotrigine and Sertraline) with anesthetics could contribute to your atypical response.  This is purely speculative without knowing the specifics of the anesthetics used.\n\n* **Underlying Genetic Factors:**  There might be underlying genetic factors that influence your pain response, anesthetic metabolism, and overall response to stress.  Research into pharmacogenomics is ongoing and might eventually provide more clarity on these individual differences.\n\n* **ADHD and Tourette's Influence:** While not a direct cause, your ADHD and Tourette's could potentially influence your perception of pain and your overall response to stress.  The hyperactivity could be an exacerbation of pre-existing tendencies.\n\n**What to do:**\n\nThe best approach is to discuss your experience with your anesthesiologist and surgeon.  They are best positioned to:\n\n* **Review your medical history in detail:**  Providing them with a comprehensive record of your surgeries, the types of anesthesia used, and your responses will be crucial.\n* **Consider genetic testing:**  They may suggest genetic testing to explore potential variations in how you metabolize medications.\n* **Adjust anesthesia protocols:** Future surgeries could potentially benefit from adjustments to your anesthesia plan based on your previous responses.\n* **Rule out other factors:**  They can help rule out other underlying medical conditions that might contribute to this phenomenon.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that this is just speculation.  A medical professional needs to evaluate your complete history and potentially conduct further testing to determine the underlying reasons for your unusual post-surgical response.  Don't hesitate to bring this up at your next doctor's appointment.  This is valuable information that could improve your future surgical experiences.\n"

        "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's impossible for me to diagnose your condition, but your description warrants a visit to your doctor or other healthcare professional.  Several factors suggest this needs medical attention:\n\n* **Recurring abdominal pain:** The return of the severe abdominal pain after a period of remission is concerning.  While dietary changes helped previously, the recurrence suggests a more persistent underlying issue.\n* **Urgency without actual need to urinate:** This symptom, combined with the abdominal pain, could point to various gastrointestinal problems or even something unrelated.\n* **Late period:** While irregular periods are common, a delay of 23 days, especially alongside abdominal pain, warrants investigation, particularly considering it's new or a different pattern.\n* **Anxiety attacks triggered by distress:**  The anxiety is a secondary symptom, but it highlights the significant distress the abdominal pain is causing.\n* **Multiple Medications:**  You're taking several medications (Keppra, Ventolin, paracetamol, and recently discontinued amitriptyline).  Interactions, side effects, or underlying conditions could be exacerbating your symptoms.\n\n**You should schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.**  They can perform a physical examination, review your medical history, including your medications, and order relevant tests (e.g., blood tests, urine tests, imaging studies) to determine the cause of your abdominal pain and other symptoms.  \n\n**Do not attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat.**  Delaying professional medical attention could worsen your condition.  Your doctor is best equipped to determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment.\n"

She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren\u2019t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's incredibly kind of you to want to support your coworker and her daughter.  Grey matter heterotopia is a rare condition, and the waiting period until October must be agonizing for them.  Unfortunately, I cannot give medical advice, and it's crucial that they rely on their daughter's neurologist for diagnosis, treatment plans, and prognosis.  However, I can offer some information that might be helpful in preparing for their meeting with the doctor and in offering comfort to your coworker.\n\n**What you can tell your coworker:**\n\n* **You are there for her:**  Let her know you're thinking of her and her daughter and that you're there to listen without judgment.  Sometimes, just knowing someone cares makes a huge difference.\n* **It's okay to feel overwhelmed:**  Acknowledge the immense emotional toll this diagnosis is taking.  It's perfectly normal to feel scared, angry, sad, or confused.\n* **Information is power:** Encourage her to write down questions for the doctor.  This will help them make the most of their appointment in October.  Some questions they might consider include:\n    * What type of grey matter heterotopia does their daughter have? (The location and severity can significantly impact symptoms and prognosis.)\n    * What are the specific seizure types their daughter is experiencing?\n    * What treatment options are available, including medication, surgery (if applicable), and other therapies?  (This might include things like physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy.)\n    * What is the long-term prognosis?  What are the potential challenges and how can they best prepare for them?\n    * What support groups or resources are available for families dealing with grey matter heterotopia?\n* **Research reputable sources:** Suggest she look for information from reputable organizations like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Epilepsy Foundation.  While online information can be helpful, it's crucial to focus on credible sources to avoid misinformation.  She should always check with her daughter's doctor before making any decisions based on online information.\n* **Focus on the present:** While it's important to plan for the future, encourage her to focus on providing comfort and care for her daughter *now*.  Small moments of joy and connection can be powerful.\n\n**What you should *not* do:**\n\n* **Offer unsolicited medical advice:** You are not a medical professional.  Stick to offering emotional support and encouragement.\n* **Minimize her feelings:**  Avoid saying things like \"It could be worse\" or \"At least...\"  Her feelings are valid, and she needs to be able to express them.\n* **Make promises you can't keep:**  Don't offer guarantees or make light of the seriousness of the situation.\n\n\nFinding reliable information about grey matter heterotopia can be challenging.  It is a rare condition, and the impact varies significantly depending on its location and size.  The information the neurologist provides in October will be crucial for understanding the specifics of their daughter's case and the best course of action.\n\nYour kindness and support are invaluable to your coworker during this difficult time.  Just being a listening ear and offering practical help, like offering to pick up groceries or run errands, can go a long way.\n"

After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these episodes.  While deja vu itself is a relatively common experience, the intense physical and emotional symptoms you describe following it are not typical.  It's important to note that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  **You should discuss this with your doctor or psychiatrist.**  They can properly assess your situation and determine the cause.\n\nHere are some possibilities your doctor might consider:\n\n* **Medication Interactions or Side Effects:** The combination of Wellbutrin, Vyvanse, Lexapro, and other medications you're taking could potentially interact in ways that contribute to these symptoms.  Some medications can cause dizziness, nausea, and disorientation as side effects.  This is a crucial area to explore with your prescribing physician.\n\n* **Anxiety or Panic Attacks:** The symptoms you describe (nausea, dizziness, confusion, overwhelming feelings) are consistent with anxiety or panic attacks.  The deja vu could be a trigger, or it could be a symptom of underlying anxiety.\n\n* **Migraines:**  Some people experience auras before a migraine, which can include visual disturbances (like deja vu) and neurological symptoms such as dizziness and nausea.\n\n* **Sleep Deprivation:**  Insufficient sleep can exacerbate anxiety, contribute to disorientation, and impact cognitive function, potentially making d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences more intense.\n\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:** While less likely, it's important to rule out any neurological conditions that could be contributing.

        "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's certainly possible that your weightlifting could be affecting your vagus nerve, contributing to your lightheadedness and passing-out episodes, especially given your history of GERD and hiatal hernia, and long-term PPI use.  However, it's crucial to understand that this is a hypothesis, and needs proper medical investigation.\n\nHere's why your situation warrants further examination:\n\n* **Vagus Nerve and GERD/Hiatal Hernia:**  The vagus nerve plays a significant role in gastrointestinal function.  A hiatal hernia and GERD can irritate the vagus nerve, leading to various symptoms, including lightheadedness, dizziness, and even fainting in some cases.  Weightlifting increases abdominal pressure, which could worsen the irritation of the vagus nerve by a hiatal hernia.\n\n* **PPIs and Vagus Nerve:** Long-term PPI use has been associated with various side effects, some of which could potentially affect vagus nerve function.  While this connection isn't fully established, it's a factor to consider, particularly in conjunction with your other conditions.\n\n* **Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance:** Intense exercise can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.  This can significantly impact your cardiovascular system and neurologic function, potentially triggering fainting episodes.\n\n* **Other Possibilities:** While the vagus nerve is a plausible explanation, other possibilities shouldn't be ruled out.  Even with negative cardio tests, there could be other cardiovascular issues that only manifest under stress (like weightlifting).  Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing) can also cause fainting and might be exacerbated by exercise.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. **Seek a gastroenterologist specializing in motility disorders:**  A specialist can assess the function of your vagus nerve and how your GERD and hiatal hernia might be contributing to your symptoms. They can also evaluate the potential impact of your long-term PPI use.\n\n2. **Consult a neurologist experienced in autonomic nervous system disorders:** This specialist can further investigate the potential vagal nerve involvement.\n\n3. **Thorough Cardiovascular Evaluation:**  While previous tests were negative, consider a more extensive cardiovascular workup, perhaps including an echocardiogram or a tilt-table test with more detailed monitoring.\n\n4. **Document your symptoms meticulously:** Keep a detailed log of your workouts, including intensity, duration, and the specific symptoms you experience before, during, and after.  This information will be invaluable to your doctors.\n\n5. **Consider a trial of reducing or discontinuing PPIs (under strict medical supervision):** This should ONLY be done under the guidance of your doctor, as abruptly stopping PPIs can have consequences.  They might want to try a different medication or a more conservative approach to managing your GERD.\n\n\nIt's crucial to have a holistic approach to diagnosing your condition. Your doctors haven't adequately connected the dots between your GERD, hiatal hernia, PPI use, and your workout-related fainting.  By seeking specialists and providing them with detailed information, you can increase the likelihood of a proper diagnosis and effective treatment.  Don't dismiss your concerns; persistent investigation is key.\n"

        "answer": "This information provides a good starting point for understanding your situation.  However, it's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice from your gastroenterologist and other healthcare providers.\n\n**Key Concerns and Questions for Your Gastroenterologist:**\n\n* **Elevated Lipase:**  The consistently elevated lipase levels (70-100) are the primary concern. While not dramatically high, they persistently indicate pancreatic inflammation.  Your doctor needs to investigate the *cause* of this inflammation.  Possible causes that need to be explored include:\n    * **Autoimmune pancreatitis:** This is a condition where the body's immune system attacks the pancreas.\n    * **Genetic predisposition:**  Certain genetic factors can increase the risk of pancreatitis.\n    * **Gallstones:** Although you haven't mentioned them, gallstones are a common cause of pancreatitis.  This should be investigated with imaging.\n    * **Other underlying conditions:**  While your diet seems healthy now, there could be other underlying conditions contributing to the inflammation.\n    * **Medication side effects:** Although less likely with Levetiracetam (Keppra), it's worth mentioning to your doctor.\n* **Pain Episodes:** The recurring, unpredictable pain episodes are consistent with chronic pancreatitis.  Your doctor needs to assess the severity and characteristics of these episodes to determine the best management strategy.\n* **Alcohol Consumption:** While you've reduced your alcohol consumption significantly, even 2-7 drinks per week could still contribute to pancreatic inflammation in some individuals. This needs to be discussed with your doctor to determine if further reduction is necessary.\n* **Past Anxiety and Lifestyle:** Although you've addressed your anxiety, it's important to ensure your doctor is aware of your past unhealthy habits.  While unlikely to be the sole cause now, it could be a contributing factor to your current condition.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Gastroenterologist:**\n\n* What are the potential causes of my elevated lipase levels?\n* What tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause of my pancreatitis? (This might include imaging such as an MRI or CT scan, blood tests beyond lipase, and potentially endoscopic ultrasound).\n* What is the best course of treatment for my mild chronic pancreatitis?\n* What lifestyle modifications (diet, alcohol consumption) are recommended to manage my condition?\n* What are the potential long-term consequences of chronic pancreatitis, and how can I minimize my risks?\n\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nYour current diet and lifestyle appear to be relatively healthy, but the persistent elevated lipase and pain episodes require further investigation.  Thorough communication with your gastroenterologist is essential to diagnose the underlying cause of your pancreatitis and develop an effective management plan.  Don't hesitate to ask questions and express your concerns.  The sooner the underlying issue is addressed, the better your chances of managing your condition effectively.\n"
