    "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",

    "answer": "Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really frustrating time. Having a seizure with no clear cause, followed by new and unsettling symptoms related to gaming, is definitely anxiety-provoking. Here's a breakdown of what could be happening and what you can do, based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **No Epilepsy Diagnosis:** The repeated negative results from your neurological testing are significant. This strongly suggests that you don't have epilepsy as the underlying cause of your seizure or the current dizziness. This is good news!\n*   **Medication Side Effect:** Your neurologists' opinion that the initial seizure was a side effect of your anxiety medication is plausible. Some medications can lower the seizure threshold, making a seizure more likely, especially if you're predisposed to it for other reasons (even temporary ones).\n*   **Anxiety & Dissociation:** Your ongoing anxiety and dissociation are crucial pieces of the puzzle. Anxiety can manifest in a variety of physical symptoms, including dizziness, lightheadedness, and a sense of unreality (dissociation).\n*   **Gaming & Disorientation:** The fact that the disorientation consistently occurs during gaming is a key piece of information. This points away from epilepsy and more towards other potential triggers.\n\n**Possible Explanations for Gaming-Related Disorientation**\n\nGiven the negative epilepsy testing, let's explore other possibilities:\n\n1.  **Visual Strain and Vestibular System Overload:**\n    *   **Visual Strain:** Intense focus on a screen, especially with rapid movements and flashing lights (common in Valorant and Apex Legends), can cause significant eye strain. This can lead to headaches, dizziness, and a feeling of being disoriented.\n    *   **Vestibular System:** Your vestibular system (inner ear) is responsible for balance and spatial orientation. Fast-paced games with rapid changes in perspective can overload this system, leading to motion sickness-like symptoms (dizziness, nausea, disorientation). This is exacerbated by the fact that the visual cues provided by the game may not match the physical cues your body is receiving (you're sitting still, but your brain perceives movement).\n2.  **Anxiety Amplification:**\n    *   **Triggers:** Gaming could be acting as a trigger for your anxiety. The intensity, competition, and potential for failure in games like Valorant and Apex Legends can elevate stress levels and bring on anxiety symptoms, including dizziness and dissociation.\n    *   **Hyperfocus:** Anxiety can sometimes lead to hyperfocus, where you become intensely absorbed in the game. When you stop, the sudden shift in focus can leave you feeling disoriented.\n3.  **Dehydration & Fatigue:**\n    *   **Dehydration:** It's easy to get dehydrated when you're engrossed in gaming. Dehydration can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\n    *   **Fatigue:** Even if you don't feel extremely tired, prolonged screen time and mental exertion can lead to fatigue, which can exacerbate dizziness and anxiety symptoms.\n4.  **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV):** Although less likely with your history, BPPV is a common cause of vertigo (a spinning sensation). It's caused by dislodged calcium crystals in the inner ear. Head movements can trigger episodes of dizziness. It's usually brief but can be unsettling.\n5.  **Cervicogenic Dizziness:** Dizziness arising from the neck can be triggered by posture, movement, or sustained muscle tension. Prolonged gaming could be a contributing factor.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nHere's a plan of action to help you manage this:\n\n1.  **Rule Out Physical Causes (Again - With More Specifics):**\n    *   **Ophthalmologist:** See an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to get a comprehensive eye exam. Mention the dizziness specifically and ask about computer vision syndrome (CVS) or digital eye strain.\n    *   **Vestibular Assessment:** Consider seeing a physical therapist who specializes in vestibular rehabilitation. They can assess your vestibular system and provide exercises to improve balance and reduce dizziness.\n    *   **ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor):** Get checked for BPPV or other inner ear issues. They can perform specific tests to diagnose BPPV and treat it with simple maneuvers.\n2.  **Optimize Gaming Habits:**\n    *   **Breaks:** Implement the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Take longer breaks (5-10 minutes) every hour.\n    *   **Screen Settings:** Adjust screen brightness and contrast to reduce eye strain. Ensure the refresh rate on your monitor is adequate.\n    *   **Posture:** Maintain good posture while gaming. Use an ergonomic chair and ensure your monitor is at eye level.\n    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout your gaming sessions.\n    *   **Lighting:** Make sure the room is well-lit to reduce eye strain. Avoid playing in a dark room with only the screen as a light source.\n    *   **Gaming time:** Reduce the length of the gaming sessions.\n3.  **Anxiety Management:**\n    *   **Therapy:** Continue or start therapy with a focus on anxiety and dissociation. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapies can be particularly helpful.\n    *   **Relaxation Techniques:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation regularly.\n    *   **Mindfulness During Gaming:** Before gaming, take a few minutes to ground yourself and notice your anxiety levels. If you start to feel anxious or disoriented during gaming, pause, take a few deep breaths, and re-center yourself.\n    *   **Medication:** If your anxiety is severe, talk to your doctor about medication options. However, be cautious about medications that might lower the seizure threshold.\n4.  **Keep a Detailed Log:**\n    *   **Track:** Keep a detailed log of when you experience dizziness/disorientation, what you were doing (specifically what game you were playing, for how long), your screen time, your stress levels, your hydration, and any other relevant factors. This can help you identify specific triggers.\n5.  **Communicate with Your Neurologist:**\n    *   **Update:** Keep your neurologist informed about your symptoms, especially the gaming-related disorientation. Even though they don't suspect epilepsy, they still need to be aware of your ongoing issues. They may be able to offer further guidance or refer you to other specialists.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's crucial to work with healthcare professionals to determine the cause of your symptoms. Avoid jumping to conclusions or relying solely on online information.\n*   **Be Patient:** Finding the cause of your symptoms and developing an effective management plan may take time. Be patient with yourself and persistent in seeking help.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If gaming consistently triggers dizziness and disorientation, it's important to respect your body's limits. Consider temporarily reducing or eliminating gaming to see if your symptoms improve.\n\nThe fact that your neurological tests are normal is very reassuring. It's likely that your symptoms are related to a combination of factors, including visual strain, vestibular system overload, anxiety, and potentially other underlying conditions. By following the recommendations above, you can work with your healthcare providers to identify the specific causes and develop a plan to manage your symptoms and get back to enjoying your life.\n"

    "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and address your key question: \"Does this count as epilepsy?\"\n\nBased on the information you've provided, it's difficult to definitively say whether you have epilepsy. Here's why:\n\n**Why it *could* be epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Unexplained Loss of Consciousness:** You've had two incidents of sudden loss of consciousness with no obvious immediate cause. This is a hallmark of seizures.\n*   **Tongue Biting and Confusion:** Tongue biting is a strong indicator of a seizure, particularly a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure. The post-ictal confusion (the confusion after a seizure) you described is also characteristic.\n*   **Neurologist's Prescription:** The fact that a neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine, an anti-epileptic drug (AED), suggests they suspect epilepsy, even if tests were normal. While it can be used for other conditions, it's most commonly prescribed for seizure control.\n* **Heavy suppressed scream:** This could point to a partial seizure.\n\n**Why it's *not definitively* epilepsy (and why more investigation is needed):**\n\n*   **Normal EEG and MRI:** A normal EEG and MRI don't rule out epilepsy. EEGs only capture brain activity for a short period and may not detect abnormalities happening deeper in the brain or between seizures. Similarly, an MRI shows brain structure, not necessarily electrical activity.\n*   **Infrequent Events:** Having only two events in over 5 years (with a large gap) is unusual for typical epilepsy.\n*   **Possible Triggers:** While you've had triggers since then, the first incident *might* have been triggered by the cold water and heat combination, causing some form of shock or vasovagal syncope, although that's less likely with the tongue biting. The second episode could also be associated with drug use (weed).\n*   **Unexplained Absence:** Your doctors were not able to determine the cause of these events.\n\n**Here's a more detailed breakdown of considerations:**\n\n*   **Syncope (Fainting):** Syncope is a temporary loss of consciousness due to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Vasovagal syncope is a common type triggered by things like pain, stress, or standing for long periods. *However*, tongue biting is much less common in syncope than in seizures.\n*   **Cardiac Issues:** Although your ECG was normal, it's possible (though less likely) that a cardiac arrhythmia could have caused the loss of consciousness.\n\n**What the Lamotrigine means:**\n\nLamotrigine works by stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. This helps to prevent the abnormal electrical activity that causes seizures. Your neurologist likely prescribed it because:\n\n1.  They believe your episodes were likely seizures, even with normal tests.\n2.  Lamotrigine has a good side-effect profile for many people.\n3.  It can be used to treat other conditions as well, making it a relatively safe \"wait and see\" approach.\n\n**What you should do NOW:**\n\n1.  **Continue taking the Lamotrigine as prescribed.** Don't stop or change the dose without talking to your neurologist.\n2.  **Keep a detailed seizure diary.** If you have another episode, carefully note the time, date, circumstances (what you were doing, feeling, etc.), and what happened during and after the event. Ask witnesses to describe what they saw.\n3.  **Discuss your concerns with your neurologist.** Express your confusion about the normal tests and your questions about the diagnosis. Don't hesitate to ask for a second opinion from another neurologist specializing in epilepsy if you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting.\n4.  **Discuss Drug Use:** Tell your doctor about your previous drug usage, including the puffs of weed. Your doctor needs to have the full picture to assess you correctly.\n5.  **Consider Ambulatory EEG:** Ask your neurologist about a longer-term EEG monitoring, such as an ambulatory EEG (a portable EEG that you wear for several days). This can increase the chances of capturing abnormal brain activity if it's intermittent.\n6.  **Genetic Testing:** Depending on your neurologist's recommendation, you might consider genetic testing for epilepsy-related genes.\n7.  **Safety Precautions:** Since you've had these episodes, it's wise to take some safety precautions, such as avoiding activities where a sudden loss of consciousness could be dangerous (e.g., swimming alone, driving, operating heavy machinery) until you have a clearer diagnosis.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nWhile you've had events that *could* be seizures, the normal tests make the diagnosis uncertain.  Keep taking your medication, be diligent with your seizure diary, and have an open and thorough discussion with your neurologist. Further testing or observation may be needed to determine the underlying cause of your episodes and the best course of treatment. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek a second opinion if needed.\n"

    "question": "Age 28, Sex male, Height 181, Weight 64,  Race caucasianDuration of complaint 2 weeks. Any existing relevant medical issues bone infection (being treated) chest pain after 3 epilepsy attacks within 2 weeks and every time under influence of drugs, thats what worries me.Current medications 3 types of antibiotics.  Include a photo if relevant",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. You're a 28-year-old Caucasian male, 181 cm tall, weighing 64 kg. You're currently being treated for a bone infection with three types of antibiotics. You've experienced chest pain after three epileptic seizures within the past two weeks, and you are concerned because these seizures occurred while you were under the influence of drugs.\n\nGiven this information, here's a breakdown of the key concerns and why you need immediate medical attention:\n\n*   **Chest Pain after Seizures:** Chest pain following a seizure can be caused by several factors, some of which can be serious. These include:\n    *   **Muscle strain:** Seizures involve violent muscle contractions, which can strain chest muscles.\n    *   **Rib fracture:** Although less common, vigorous muscle contractions can cause rib fractures.\n    *   **Aspiration pneumonia:** If you aspirated (inhaled) stomach contents during the seizure, it could lead to pneumonia.\n    *   **Cardiac issues:** Seizures can sometimes trigger heart problems, although less common than the other causes.\n    *   **Pulmonary issues:** Seizures can impact breathing and oxygen levels, which could present as chest pain.\n*   **Seizures and Drug Use:** The fact that the seizures occurred while under the influence of drugs is extremely concerning. Many drugs can lower the seizure threshold and make seizures more likely. It can also interact with the bone infection medication, causing more seizures.\n*   **Drug-induced Bone Infection:** Intravenous drug users are at high risk of bone infections.\n*   **Drug Interactions:** Combining antibiotics with other drugs (including illicit substances) can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous interactions. This can affect the effectiveness of the antibiotics and increase the risk of side effects.\n*   **Bone Infection Treatment:** Receiving three antibiotics at once usually means that the bone infection is severe or difficult to treat.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Seek IMMEDIATE Medical Attention:** You NEED to be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. Go to the nearest emergency room or urgent care clinic.\n2.  **Be Honest with Medical Professionals:** It's crucial to be completely honest with the doctors about your drug use. They need to know this information to accurately diagnose the cause of your seizures and chest pain and to provide appropriate treatment. All medical professionals are bound by patient confidentiality.\n3.  **Do not use drugs until you seek help from a doctor** They may be the cause of your seizures, and may be detrimental to your health.\n\n**What to Tell the Doctor:**\n\n*   Your age, height, and weight.\n*   That you're being treated for a bone infection and the names of the antibiotics you're taking.\n*   That you experienced three seizures in the past two weeks, each occurring while you were under the influence of drugs.\n*   A detailed description of the chest pain (location, intensity, what makes it better or worse).\n*   The types of drugs you used.\n*   Any other symptoms you're experiencing.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n"

    "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused and concerned. Navigating a new diagnosis like epilepsy can be overwhelming, especially when it seems to contradict what you've read. Let's break down some of the key aspects:\n\n**Why the Neurologist's Opinion Changed**\n\n*   **Initial Assessment:** It's common for neurologists to initially be cautious about diagnosing epilepsy after only one seizure, especially in adults. The neurologist was likely trying to determine if the seizure was provoked by a temporary factor (like sleep deprivation, medication, or a one-time illness) before definitively labeling it as epilepsy.\n*   **EEG Results:** The EEG results are the key here. The EEG records brainwave activity, and certain patterns can be highly suggestive of epilepsy, even without multiple seizures.\n\n**How EEGs are Used to Diagnose Epilepsy**\n\n*   **Epileptiform Discharges:** These are specific, abnormal electrical patterns seen on an EEG that are strongly associated with a predisposition to seizures. They are also called spikes, sharp waves, or spike-and-wave complexes.\n*   **Interictal Discharges:** These are epileptiform discharges that occur *between* seizures (interictal). Their presence significantly increases the likelihood of an epilepsy diagnosis, especially if the person has already had a seizure. Even if your husband hasn't had another seizure, the EEG may have shown these interictal discharges, leading to the diagnosis.\n*   **Ictal Recordings:** These are EEG recordings *during* a seizure (ictal). These are often very clear and can confirm the seizure is epileptic in nature and even help localize where in the brain it is starting. However, it is very unlikely the EEG would have been done during a seizure since it was unexpected.\n*   **Not a Guessing Game, but Interpretation is Key:** It's not just about having an \"abnormal\" EEG. Many things can cause an abnormal EEG, but epileptiform discharges are specific and indicate a higher risk of seizures. The neurologist interprets the EEG findings in the context of your husband's clinical history (the seizure itself).\n*   **False Positives:** It is possible, although not necessarily common, for an EEG to have false positives. This is why the interpretation is important.\n\n**Epilepsy Diagnosis: More Than Just Two Seizures**\n\n*   **The \"Two Seizures\" Rule:** The traditional definition of epilepsy involved having two or more unprovoked seizures. However, diagnostic criteria have evolved.\n*   **Single Seizure with High Risk:** Epilepsy can now be diagnosed after only one seizure if there is a high risk of recurrence. This risk is usually determined by the EEG findings or if there is evidence of a structural abnormality on the MRI scan (which you mentioned he is awaiting). For example, someone with a brain tumor causing a seizure is more likely to be diagnosed with epilepsy after one seizure than someone who had a seizure with no obvious cause and a normal EEG.\n\n**Potential Causes for a Single Seizure**\n\nA number of things can cause a seizure, so it is important to be aware of possible causes. Examples of these are:\n\n*   Sleep deprivation\n*   Very low blood sugar\n*   Electrolyte imbalance\n*   Alcohol or drug use\n*   Recent head trauma or injury\n*   Stroke\n*   Infection, such as meningitis\n\n**Misdiagnosis and What To Do**\n\n*   **Misdiagnosis is Possible:** While neurologists are experts, misdiagnosis can occur. It is less about the neurologist not knowing the information, and more about the interpretation of the data.\n*   **Factors Influencing Accuracy:** The accuracy of an EEG depends on several factors, including the technician's skill, the duration of the recording, and whether the patient was awake, asleep, or sleep-deprived during the test. Sleep-deprived EEGs are often used to increase the chances of capturing epileptiform activity.\n*   **Second Opinion:** If you have significant doubts, seeking a second opinion from another epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy) is a reasonable step.\n\n**Questions to Ask the Neurologist**\n\n*   **Specifically, what epileptiform discharges were seen on the EEG?** Ask for the specific terminology (e.g., \"spike-and-wave discharges,\" \"focal sharp waves\").\n*   **Where in the brain were these discharges located?** (If applicable, as some discharges can be more generalized.)\n*   **What is the level of confidence that these discharges indicate epilepsy, and what other conditions could potentially explain the EEG findings?**\n*   **How does the MRI scan factor into the diagnosis and treatment plan?**\n*   **What are the risks and benefits of starting medication now versus waiting and seeing if another seizure occurs?**\n*   **What are the potential side effects of the recommended medication?**\n*   **What lifestyle modifications (sleep, alcohol, etc.) might help reduce the risk of future seizures?**\n*   **What are the next steps in the evaluation and treatment plan?**\n\n**In Summary**\n\nYour husband's diagnosis isn't necessarily contradictory to what you've read. The EEG findings likely provided enough evidence of a high risk of future seizures for the neurologist to make an epilepsy diagnosis after only one observed seizure. However, your concerns are valid, and asking clarifying questions is crucial. Discuss the specific EEG findings with the neurologist, understand the rationale behind the diagnosis, and explore all treatment options. If you still have doubts, consider a second opinion from an epileptologist. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your question. You're asking about the specific reasons why someone with controlled epilepsy, specifically managed with lamotrigine, might be turned away from donating plasma. You've had relatively few seizures in a long time and are wondering if the denial you experienced was medically justified.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the potential reasons, keeping in mind that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice:\n\n**Potential Medical Reasons for Denying Plasma Donation with Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Seizure Risk and Donation Procedure:** The process of plasma donation (plasmapheresis) involves removing blood, separating the plasma, and returning the red blood cells to the donor. This process can cause fluctuations in blood volume and electrolytes, and even involve medical devices inserting needles into the veins. These factors *could* potentially trigger a seizure in a susceptible individual, even if their epilepsy is well-controlled. This is the most likely reason.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope and Seizures:**  Fainting (vasovagal syncope) is a relatively common reaction to blood draws. While not a seizure, the drop in blood pressure and oxygen to the brain during fainting *can* sometimes trigger a seizure in someone with a pre-existing seizure disorder. Plasma donation increases the likelihood of vasovagal syncope.\n*   **Medication Effects:** While lamotrigine is generally well-tolerated, any medication has potential side effects.  The donation center might be concerned about how the plasma donation process could affect lamotrigine levels in your body or how any potential side effects of the medication might interact with the donation process.\n*   **Overall Health and Well-being:** Donation centers prioritize the health and safety of donors. Epilepsy, even when controlled, is a chronic condition that requires ongoing medical management. The donation center may have a policy of erring on the side of caution, especially if they lack specific expertise in managing donors with epilepsy.\n*   **Specific Center Policies:**  Each plasma donation center has its own set of eligibility criteria, which may be more or less restrictive than general guidelines. Their policies might reflect their risk tolerance, the training of their staff, and their ability to handle potential complications. It is possible the specific center you visited has a blanket policy against accepting plasma donations from individuals with epilepsy, regardless of seizure control.\n*   **Liability Concerns:** Donation centers also must consider legal liability. If a donor experiences a seizure or other adverse event during or after donation, the center could be held liable. This can influence their eligibility criteria.\n*   **Impact of Seizure on Blood Products (Less Likely but Possible):** Although unlikely with well-controlled epilepsy, theoretical concerns could exist about the quality of plasma collected immediately following a seizure. However, given the infrequency of your seizures, this is probably not the primary reason.\n\n**Why You Were Likely Turned Away:**\n\nGiven your history, the most probable reason for being turned away is the *potential* for a seizure to be triggered by the donation process itself or by vasovagal syncope related to the blood draw. Donation centers tend to be very cautious.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Neurologist:**  The most important step is to discuss this with your neurologist. They know your medical history best and can assess the risks and benefits of plasma donation in your specific case. They can provide a written statement if they believe you are a suitable candidate.\n2.  **Contact the Plasma Donation Center Directly (Again):** Call the donation center and ask to speak with their medical director or the physician in charge. Explain your situation, the stability of your condition, and your neurologist's opinion (if you have it). Ask them specifically about the reasons for their policy regarding epilepsy.\n3.  **Consider Alternative Donation Centers:**  Policies can vary. If your neurologist believes you are a good candidate, and the first center remains unwilling, you could explore other donation centers in your area.\n4.  **Be Prepared to Provide Documentation:** If you pursue this, be prepared to provide documentation from your neurologist about your seizure control, medication, and overall health.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Honesty is Crucial:** Always be honest about your medical history when donating blood or plasma. Withholding information puts your health and the health of the recipient at risk.\n*   **Prioritize Your Health:**  Your health and well-being are paramount. If there's any significant risk involved, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid plasma donation.\n\nIn summary, while your epilepsy is well-controlled, the potential risks associated with the donation process, combined with the conservative policies of donation centers, likely explain why you were turned away. The best course of action is to have an informed discussion with your neurologist and then, if appropriate, with the medical staff at the donation center. Good luck!\n"

    "answer": "This is a really important question and it's understandable that you're seeking clarity. Here's a breakdown to help you navigate those medical forms:\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n*   **\"History of\" vs. \"Currently Have\":** The key phrasing is crucial. You *do* have a *history* of epilepsy and a *history* of seizures. You *do not currently have* epilepsy or seizures.\n\n*   **The Purpose of the Questions:** Medical history questions aim to identify potential risk factors or conditions that could impact your current health, treatment, or medication.\n\n*   **Hippocampal Removal:** The removal of part of your hippocampus is a significant piece of your medical history. It can potentially influence cognitive function, memory, and mood, and it's essential for healthcare providers to know.\n\n**How to Approach the Forms:**\n\n1.  **When the Question is \"Do you have epilepsy/seizure disorder?\":**\n    *   **Answer: Yes.** Always be honest.\n    *   **Then Explain:** In the space provided (or verbally), clearly state: \"I had temporal lobe epilepsy from age 8 to 10.

I am not currently taking anti-epileptic medication.\"\n\n2.  **When the Question is \"Have you ever had a seizure?\":**\n    *   **Answer: Yes.**\n    *   **Then Explain:** (Same explanation as above).\n\n3.  **When the Question is \"Are you currently taking medication for seizures/epilepsy?\":**\n    *   **Answer: No.** (Unless you *are* taking medication for something else, in which case, list them all accurately).\n\n**Why It Still Matters (Even Though You're Seizure-Free):**\n\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Certain medications can lower the seizure threshold, even in people without a current seizure disorder. Knowing your history allows doctors to be cautious when prescribing new medications.\n*   **Brain Surgery History:** Your history of brain surgery itself is significant. It can impact how your brain functions and responds to certain treatments.\n*   **Anesthesia:** Anesthesiologists need to be aware of any brain surgery history, as it can influence anesthesia management.\n*   **Rare Recurrence:** While unlikely, there's always a very small chance of seizure recurrence, even years after successful surgery. Doctors need to be aware of your history to evaluate any new neurological symptoms appropriately.\n*   **Cognitive Impact:** The removal of a portion of your hippocampus *can* have subtle cognitive effects, even if you are functioning well.  Sharing this information allows healthcare providers to understand your baseline and interpret any cognitive changes that might occur.\n\n**When is it Less Relevant?**\n\n*   **Routine Forms for Non-Medical Contexts:**  If you're filling out a form for a gym membership or a job that doesn't involve safety-sensitive tasks, you may not need to disclose it. However, if the form asks directly about neurological conditions or surgeries, it's best to err on the side of caution and disclose it.\n*   **Casual Conversations:** You don't need to bring it up in casual conversations unless it's relevant to the topic.\n\n**Regarding the DMV:**\n\n*   **Each State is Different:** Driving regulations regarding seizure history vary widely by state.\n*   **Stay Informed:** Contact your local DMV to understand the specific requirements in your state regarding seizure history and driving privileges.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nBe honest and upfront on medical forms. Provide a concise, clear explanation of your seizure history, the surgery, and your current seizure-free status. This information is essential for your ongoing health and safety. It's better to provide the information and have it be deemed not relevant than to omit it and potentially risk your well-being.\n"

    "question": "27 years old male Non smoker 73 kg 180 cm No other chronic illnessFor the past decade, I've been dealing with two distinct issues.- The first involves zigzag flashes across my field of vision, which are then followed by a mild headache lasting about an hour.- The second is an abrupt sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or dream recall that leaves me feeling anxious and uncertain about my own memories.Both of these \"auras\" typically last around 20 minutes. I haven't sought treatment yet since these episodes occur infrequently\u2014sometimes just once a year or once every few months.I'm unsure if what I'm experiencing is related to epilepsy or migraines?If anyone has had similar experiences, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thanks for providing such a detailed description of your experiences. It's definitely wise to investigate these symptoms, even if they are infrequent, to rule out any underlying serious conditions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why your description could point towards either migraine or epilepsy, and what steps you should take:\n\n**Why Migraine is a Possibility:**\n\n*   **Zigzag Flashes/Visual Auras:** This is a classic symptom of migraine *with* aura. The zigzag patterns are often described as scintillating scotomas.  This visual aura typically precedes a headache, but can also occur without a headache (silent migraine).\n*   **Mild Headache:** The headache following the visual disturbance supports the possibility of migraine.\n*   **Frequency:** While migraines can be frequent, they can also occur infrequently, like you describe.\n*   **Duration:** The 20-minute aura and 1-hour headache duration fit within the typical range for migraine.\n\n**Why Epilepsy is a Possibility (Though Less Likely, Given Your Description):**\n\n*   **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu/Dream Recall Sensation:** D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a known symptom associated with certain types of epileptic seizures, particularly temporal lobe seizures. The feeling of anxiety and uncertainty about memories could also be related to seizure activity affecting the brain's memory centers.\n*   **Auras:**  Auras can be associated with both migraine and epilepsy.\n*   **Brief Duration:** The 20 minute episode could represent a short seizure.\n\n**Why It Might Not Be *Typical* Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Frequency:** Seizures related to epilepsy would usually be more frequent than once a year or every few months.\n*   **No Loss of Consciousness/Convulsions:** You haven't mentioned any loss of consciousness, convulsions, or other common seizure symptoms.\n*   **Headache:** The headache doesn't point towards a classic seizure presentation\n\n**Key Differences to Consider:**\n\n| Feature         | Migraine with Aura                                                              | Epilepsy (Focal/Partial Onset)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Aura**        | Visual (zigzag, flashing lights, blind spots), sensory (numbness, tingling)        | Sensory (smells, tastes), emotional (fear, anxiety, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu), cognitive (altered perception) - *Can be very subjective and difficult to describe.*                                                                                                                   |\n| **Headache**      | Often follows the aura, throbbing, unilateral, sensitivity to light/sound       | May or may not be present; if present, usually follows the seizure.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu**      | Uncommon, but can occur as part of a complex aura                               | More characteristic of temporal lobe seizures (focal onset aware seizures)                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **Duration**      | Aura: 5-60 minutes; Headache: 4-72 hours                                      | Seizure: Usually lasts a few seconds to a few minutes.

They can take a detailed medical history, perform a neurological exam, and order appropriate tests. *Don't delay seeing a doctor because the events are infrequent. The information you provide is important to guide their investigation.*\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:** For the next few months, meticulously record the following:\n    *   **Date and Time of Each Episode:**\n    *   **Detailed Description of the Aura:**  Be as specific as possible about the visual distortions (shape, color, movement), the nature of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (how strong was the feeling, what exactly did it feel like you were remembering), and any other sensations.\n    *   **Headache Characteristics:**  Location, intensity, type of pain (throbbing, stabbing, dull), associated symptoms (nausea, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity).\n    *   **Duration of Each Phase:** Aura, headache, and any lingering effects.\n    *   **Potential Triggers:**  Stress levels, sleep patterns, food intake, caffeine/alcohol consumption, menstrual cycle (if applicable), exposure to bright lights or screens.\n3.  **Potential Diagnostic Tests:** The neurologist will likely order some or all of the following:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This test measures electrical activity in the brain and can help detect seizure activity.  *It's important to note that a normal EEG doesn't necessarily rule out epilepsy, especially if the seizures are infrequent.* Your neurologist might order an EEG during sleep deprivation as this can help to provoke any underlying seizure tendencies.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** This imaging test can rule out structural abnormalities in the brain that might be causing your symptoms.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To rule out other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n4.  **Consider a Video EEG:** In some cases, a video EEG might be recommended.  This involves recording both your brain activity and a video of you simultaneously, which can be helpful in correlating your symptoms with any abnormal brain activity.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's crucial to get a professional diagnosis from a neurologist.\n*   **Driving:** If you're experiencing episodes that could potentially impair your awareness or control, discuss with your doctor whether it's safe for you to drive.\n*   **Anxiety:**  The uncertainty surrounding your symptoms can be anxiety-provoking.  Talk to your doctor about ways to manage your anxiety.\n\nIn summary, your symptoms could be related to migraine with aura, or potentially a type of focal epilepsy, or even something else entirely.  A neurologist is the best person to evaluate your symptoms and determine the correct diagnosis and treatment plan. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "My partner (20M) has been having these \u2018seizure-like\u2019 behaviours for as long as he can remember (so assuming his whole life). There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",

    "answer": "Okay, this sounds complex and concerning, and it's good you're seeking information and trying to understand what's happening with your partner. Let's break this down and consider some possibilities:\n\n**Understanding the Description:**\n\n*   **Frequent, Daily Occurrence:** The high frequency of these events is significant.\n*   **Two Separate Actions:** The fact that there are two distinct types of episodes raises different possibilities. It is possible that they could be related, but it is also possible that they are not.\n*   **Facial Expressions and Body Vibrations:** This points to a neurological or movement-related origin.\n*   **Variable Awareness:** His lack of awareness is a crucial piece of information.\n*   **Triggers (or Lack Thereof):** While not always linked to clear triggers, heightened emotional or stimulating situations seem to increase the frequency or intensity.\n*   **Social Impact:** The fact that these 'spasms' are misunderstood by others can be very isolating and distressing.\n\n**Possible Considerations (Disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice):**\n\nGiven the information provided, some possibilities to consider (and discuss with a medical professional) include:\n\n*   **Tics/Tourette's Syndrome:** Simple tics can involve facial grimacing and repetitive movements. Tourette's is characterized by both motor and vocal tics, although the vocal tics can be subtle (e.g., throat clearing, sniffing). The fact that these have been present since childhood and the variable awareness could align with this. Sometimes heightened emotions or stress can exacerbate tics.\n*   **Myoclonus:** Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary twitching or jerking of a muscle or group of muscles.  It can be normal (like a hiccup) or a sign of a nervous system disorder. The 'vibrating' sensation could potentially be a form of myoclonus.\n*   **Focal Seizures (with impaired awareness):** This is something that needs to be ruled out. Focal seizures originate in one area of the brain and can cause a variety of symptoms, including altered awareness, automatisms (repetitive movements like lip smacking or hand movements), and sensory changes. The facial expressions and lack of awareness could be consistent with this, especially given the potential for emotional triggers.\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a condition where there are neurological symptoms (like movements, sensory changes, or seizures) that are not caused by structural damage or disease in the nervous system. The symptoms are real, but they are thought to be related to problems with how the brain is functioning. FND can sometimes be triggered by stress or emotional factors.\n*   **Stereotypies:** These are repetitive, seemingly purposeless movements that can be seen in people with developmental disabilities or autism spectrum disorder. However, they can also occur in individuals without these conditions, sometimes as a coping mechanism or self-soothing behavior.\n*   **Anxiety-Related Behaviors:** Although less likely given the reported lack of awareness, it's possible that these are physical manifestations of anxiety.\n\n**What to Do Next:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Doctor:** The *most important* step is to schedule an appointment with a doctor, preferably a neurologist. Describe the events in as much detail as possible.  Mention that these have been occurring since childhood.\n\n2.  **Video Recording:** If possible and if he is comfortable, try to discreetly record an episode of each type of event. This will be invaluable for the doctor to see exactly what is happening.\n\n3.  **Keep a Log:** Start keeping a detailed log of the episodes. Note the time of day, what he was doing immediately beforehand, any potential triggers, the duration of the episode, and any symptoms he experiences afterward (even if he can't remember the episode itself).\n\n4.  **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** The neurologist will likely order an EEG to assess brainwave activity and rule out seizures. An MRI of the brain may also be recommended.\n\n5.  **Be Patient:** Diagnosing neurological conditions can take time and may involve multiple tests and consultations.\n\n**Important Considerations for the Doctor:**\n\n*   **Frequency:** The high frequency of these events.\n*   **Duration:** How long each episode lasts.\n*   **Awareness:** His lack of awareness during many of the episodes.\n*   **Triggers:** Any potential triggers, even if they seem inconsistent.\n*   **Childhood Onset:** That these have been happening since childhood.\n*   **Social Impact:** The distress caused by others misunderstanding the behaviors.\n\n**Things You Can Do to Support Him:**\n\n*   **Be Understanding:** Continue to be supportive and patient. Let him know that you're there for him and that you want to help him figure out what's going on.\n*   **Avoid Judgment:** Refrain from making judgmental comments or trying to stop the behaviors yourself.\n*   **Educate Others:** If he's comfortable with it, consider gently explaining the situation to close friends and family so they can be more understanding.\n*   **Reduce Stress:** Help him identify and manage any stressors in his life.\n*   **Encourage Professional Help:** Gently encourage him to seek professional help. Reassure him that seeking medical attention is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nIt is critical to consult with a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional medical advice.\n"

    "question": "I have tc seizures about twice a month or so. I have recently run out of my generic keppra 3 days ago. I will not be able to get a new script for keppra until Monday. I do have my rescue medication (generic Ativan) which I have never had to take before. should I take this every 12 hours like I do my keppra?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It is crucial that you contact your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical attention. Suddenly stopping Keppra can increase the risk of seizures, and taking Ativan every 12 hours without medical supervision is not recommended.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Stopping Keppra:** Abruptly discontinuing Keppra can lead to withdrawal seizures or status epilepticus, a dangerous condition where seizures are prolonged or occur repeatedly without recovery in between.\n*   **Ativan (Lorazepam):** Ativan is a benzodiazepine used as a rescue medication to stop a seizure in progress. It's not meant for regular, scheduled use like Keppra. Taking it every 12 hours could lead to:\n\n    *   **Tolerance and Dependence:** Your body can become used to Ativan, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect, and you may experience withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it.\n    *   **Side Effects:** Ativan can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, impaired coordination, and respiratory depression.\n    *   **Interaction:** Ativan may interact with other medications you are taking.\n*   **Importance of Medical Guidance:** Your doctor needs to assess your situation, consider the potential risks of seizure activity, and determine the safest course of action. They may be able to:\n\n    *   Provide a temporary prescription or bridge medication.\n    *   Advise on the appropriate use of Ativan as a rescue medication.\n    *   Monitor you for any signs of withdrawal or increased seizure risk.\n\nDo not attempt to manage this situation on your own. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical care immediately."

    "question": "25MI don't get it. I'm awake and alert in the middle of the day. and everything's fine. I wake up early and my brain says, \"screw you, here's a seizure. Have fun.\"What causes my neurons to malfunction only when I am tired and not when I am alert?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's incredibly frustrating to deal with seizures, especially when they seem to follow a specific pattern. The fact that yours predominantly occur when you're waking up early suggests a few potential underlying mechanisms related to sleep, brainwave activity, and overall neuronal excitability. Here's a breakdown of potential reasons why seizures might be triggered specifically when you are tired and waking up, but not when you are fully alert:\n\n**1. Sleep-Wake Transition:**\n\n*   **Brainwave Changes:** The transition from sleep to wakefulness is a period of significant change in brainwave activity. During sleep, brainwaves are slower and more synchronized. As you wake up, they shift to faster and more desynchronized patterns. This rapid shifting can destabilize neuronal networks in individuals with a predisposition to seizures.\n*   **Cortical Excitability:** There's evidence that cortical excitability is at its highest during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. This increased excitability could be enough to push susceptible neurons past their threshold, triggering a seizure.\n\n**2. Sleep Deprivation and Sleep Disruption:**\n\n*   **Lowered Seizure Threshold:** Sleep deprivation is a well-known trigger for seizures in many people with epilepsy. Even relatively mild disruptions in sleep can lower the seizure threshold, making seizures more likely. Waking up early might mean you're consistently getting less sleep than your body needs, even if you don't feel overtly sleep-deprived during the day.\n*   **Altered Neurotransmitter Levels:** Sleep deprivation can affect the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly those involved in regulating neuronal excitability, such as GABA (inhibitory) and glutamate (excitatory). Reduced GABA or increased glutamate can increase the likelihood of seizures.\n\n**3. Circadian Rhythm Influence:**\n\n*   **Hormonal Changes:** Your circadian rhythm (the body's internal clock) regulates various hormonal processes, including the release of cortisol (a stress hormone). Cortisol levels tend to be highest in the morning, just before waking. In some individuals, these hormonal fluctuations can influence neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility.\n*   **Gene Expression:** Recent research suggests that certain genes related to epilepsy may have cyclical expression patterns influenced by the circadian rhythm. This means their activity and impact on neuronal function could vary depending on the time of day.\n\n**4. Medication Timing and Levels (if applicable):**\n\n*   **Trough Levels:** If you're taking anti-seizure medication, its concentration in your bloodstream might be at its lowest (the \"trough level\") right before you take your morning dose. This reduced level of medication could leave you more vulnerable to seizures.\n*   **Metabolism Fluctuations:** Even if you take your medication regularly, individual differences in metabolism and absorption can lead to variations in drug levels throughout the day.\n\n**5. Other Contributing Factors:**\n\n*   **Stress:** Stress, both physical and emotional, can lower the seizure threshold. The act of waking up early, especially if it's associated with anxiety about the day ahead, could contribute to seizure likelihood.\n*   **Blood Sugar Levels:** Fluctuations in blood sugar, particularly hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), can sometimes trigger seizures.\n*   **Dehydration:** Being mildly dehydrated in the morning could also play a role, as dehydration can affect electrolyte balance in the brain.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Neurologist:** The most important step is to discuss this pattern with your neurologist. They can perform further testing (e.g., EEG, sleep studies) to investigate the underlying cause and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.\n2.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Focus on improving your sleep hygiene. This includes:\n    *   Maintaining a regular sleep schedule (going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends).\n    *   Creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n    *   Ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n    *   Avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n    *   Getting regular exercise, but not too close to bedtime.\n3.  **Sleep Study:** Ask your neurologist if a sleep study is appropriate. It can help identify any underlying sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) that might be contributing to your seizures.\n4.  **Medication Review:** If you're taking anti-seizure medication, discuss the timing of your doses with your doctor. They may recommend adjusting the timing or dosage to better control morning seizures.\n5.  **Keep a Seizure Diary:** Record the time, date, and any potential triggers (e.g., sleep deprivation, stress, missed medication) associated with your seizures. This can help you and your neurologist identify patterns and potential contributing factors.\n6.  **Lifestyle Modifications:** Try to manage stress through relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Stay well-hydrated and eat a balanced diet to maintain stable blood sugar levels.\n\nIt is important to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is intended for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional medical advice from a qualified healthcare provider. It is essential to consult with your neurologist or other healthcare professional to discuss your specific situation and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n"

    "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out.

    "answer": "Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and distressing. It's completely understandable that you're seeking help and want your life back. The combination of the adverse medical event, the pre-existing conditions, and the subsequent changes you're experiencing paints a complex picture. Here's a breakdown of potential areas to explore and actions you can consider, given the information you've provided:\n\n**1. Addressing the Medical Trauma and Potential Neurological Damage:**\n\n*   **Seek a Second Opinion from a Different Neurologist:**  While you've reported this to your current neurologist, their \"indifference\" is a serious red flag.  Find a neurologist specializing in epilepsy *and* post-anesthesia neurological complications. You need a thorough evaluation focusing on:\n    *   **Repeat EEG:** To assess current seizure activity and any changes in brainwave patterns since the incident. Consider an ambulatory EEG (longer monitoring at home) to capture nocturnal seizures.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** To rule out any structural changes or damage that may have resulted from the seizures or propofol administration.  Ask specifically if they are looking for *subtle* changes, not just obvious lesions.\n    *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** This can evaluate cognitive function (memory, attention, executive function) and can help determine if there are specific areas affected by the seizures or the medication. It can also objectively measure emotional and behavioral changes.\n    *   **Consider Video EEG Monitoring:** This can help correlate any behavioral changes you're having to potential subclinical seizure activity.\n    *   **Documentation is Key:**  Keep detailed notes of your symptoms, including the time of day, severity, triggers (if any), and how long they last. This will be invaluable for the neurologist.\n\n*   **Consider a Consultation with a Anesthesiologist that Specializes in Complications:** Find a anesthesiologist that specializes in complications arising from anesthesia. This could provide insight if your prior medical history and current medications have increased the risk of complications arising from propofol.\n\n**2. Addressing the Mental Health Crisis:**\n\n*   **Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) or Inpatient Hospitalization:** You mentioned this is being considered, and it sounds like it might be necessary.  Given the severity of your symptoms (panic attacks, crying spells, functional impairment), a higher level of care could provide:\n    *   **Intensive Therapy:**  Daily or several times a week therapy focused on trauma processing, coping skills, and managing anxiety and depression.  Look for programs with therapists experienced in CPTSD and medical trauma.\n    *   **Medication Management:**  Closer monitoring and adjustment of your medications by a psychiatrist.\n    *   **Structured Environment:**  A safe and supportive environment to stabilize your mood and develop coping strategies.\n    *   **Group Therapy:**  Connecting with others who have similar experiences can be validating and helpful.\n\n*   **Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  It's crucial to find a therapist who specializes in trauma, particularly CPTSD and medical trauma.  EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), or Somatic Experiencing could be beneficial.\n*   **Medication Review and Optimization:** Work closely with your psychiatrist to re-evaluate your medications. The escitalopram increase might need more time to take effect, but it's important to consider other options if it's not sufficient. Buspirone is often used for anxiety, but it's not always effective for panic disorder.  Considerations:\n    *   **Augmentation Strategies:**  If the escitalopram is partially effective, your psychiatrist might consider adding another medication to boost its effects.\n    *   **Alternative Antidepressants:**  If escitalopram isn't working, another SSRI or a different class of antidepressant (SNRI, atypical antidepressant) might be more effective.\n    *   **Anti-Anxiety Medications:**  Since lorazepam failed, explore other options for managing panic attacks, such as pregabalin (Lyrica) or hydroxyzine. (Note: Always discuss potential interactions with your other medications with your doctor and pharmacist).\n    *   **Prazosin:** This medication can be helpful for nightmares and sleep disturbances related to trauma.\n\n*   **Sleep Hygiene and Management:**  The 3:00-3:30 AM awakenings are common with anxiety and trauma.  Focus on:\n    *   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n    *   **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Avoid screens for at least an hour before bed.  Try a warm bath, reading, or listening to calming music.\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool Bedroom:**  Optimize your sleep environment.\n    *   **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol Before Bed:**\n    *   **Consider Melatonin:**  Talk to your doctor about trying melatonin to regulate your sleep-wake cycle.\n\n**3. Legal and Ethical Considerations:**\n\n*   **Continue Pursuing the Complaint Against the Anesthesiologist:**  Document everything, including the names of all medical staff involved, dates, times, and specific details of what happened.  Keep copies of all medical records. If you haven't already, consider consulting with a medical malpractice attorney.  There may be a statute of limitations on filing a lawsuit, so it's important to act quickly.\n*   **Report to the State Medical Board:** In addition to the hospital complaint, consider filing a complaint with your state's medical board. This can lead to disciplinary action against the anesthesiologist.\n*   **Consider Trauma Informed Lawyer:** It may be beneficial to find a lawyer that is aware of trauma and understands its impact to help you navigate the legal process.\n\n**4. Self-Care and Support:**\n\n*   **Support Groups:**  Find support groups for people with epilepsy, chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD, or medical trauma.  Sharing your experiences with others can be incredibly helpful.\n*   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Practice mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga to help manage anxiety and stress.\n*   **Gentle Exercise:**  Even a short walk each day can improve your mood and energy levels.\n*   **Healthy Diet:**  Eat a balanced diet and avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive caffeine.\n*   **Creative Outlets:**  Engage in activities that you enjoy, such as painting, writing, music, or spending time in nature.\n*   **Communicate with Your Partner:**  Openly communicate with your partner about your struggles and needs.  Their support is essential.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **Be Proactive and Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't hesitate to seek second opinions, ask questions, and demand the care you deserve.\n*   **Focus on a Holistic Approach:**  Address the neurological, psychological, and emotional aspects of your situation.\n*   **Be Patient:**  Recovery takes time, and there will be setbacks along the way.  Celebrate small victories and don't give up hope.\n*   **Build a Strong Support System:**  Surround yourself with people who understand and support you.\n\nThis is a lot to process, but remember that you are not alone. With the right medical care, therapy, and support, you can begin to heal and regain control of your life. Start by taking small steps and focusing on what you can control. Good luck, and please seek professional help as soon as possible.\n"

    "question": "I have 2 conditions(?) i want to mention, the second being (in my opinion) more severe than the first.the first is something ive noticed more recently. im not sure how long its been going on. i got an apple watch in december, which is the first heart rate tracking device ive owned. ive been using it to occasionally measure my heartrate, and ive noticed that my resting heart rate lies anywhere from 20-50 or 60 bpm lower than my standing heart rate. for a while, immediately upon standing i would become dizzy and my vision would fade a little, and i would see spots. this usually clears up after around 10 seconds 20 seconds at the most. ive seen a lot of resources about pots but i dont and have never fainted or started sweating due to standing the second is something i can give a lot more details on. ive been calling these \"blackouts\" but thats not medically accurate. it usually starts with me feeling unusually sick for a bit, then suddenly, the sickness symptoms will instantly disappear and my hearing will muffle greatly, and my ears will start ringing, but the ringing is also muffled. then, my field of vision will begin to tunnel, gradually getting smaller and smaller, until it becomes completely black, at which point i lose all recollection of what im doing, im basically acting without being conscious.these started when i was 8 and have happened every few years or so since, with them gradually getting worse and worse. the first time it happened, it was just slight lightheadedness and nausea, then muffled hearing and my vision partially tunneling, but not going all the way. this more recent time a little less than 2 years ago, however, i felt extremely nauseous, i felt extremely cold yet i was sweating profusely, i think i might have had a headache too i cant fully remember. i felt like i was gonna die before the \"blackout\" even started and the muffled hearing started. when i fully blacked out and lost consciousness (while still controlling my body, like a zombie in a sense), i have no idea how long i was out for, and i only was brought back to reality when i felt water hit my foot after i knocked over a pitcher.ive done a lot of research on this specifically and the closest thing ive found has been transient ischemic attacks. im not fully sure if this is a tia though, especially because i cant recall weakness in one side of my body at any time during one of these, but that might be because my memory during these events isnt really the best. additionally, my moms biological mom had several strokes before dying of another stroke, which could make me more predisposed to strokes, but again im not entirely sure. ive also gotten results for certain types of epilepsy, but i never looked too deep into them so that may not be validthe reason i bring these two afflictions up together is because maybe im missing something? maybe these are both signs of a rare illness or something? maybe theyre two different things that are co morbid? they may have nothing to do with each other at all though, i just want to include anything i can think of some other things i have are a heat sensitivity (not sure if this is the correct term, but basically i just get really really hot for no reason and cant cool off until i put cold water on my body), as well as sweating a lot, like ill be cold and still sweating. not sure if these have anything to do with the above but im adding it here just in case.if you have any questions feel free to ask, theres something i may have forgotten to add here. also im sorry about the length, i have a tendency to explain things with a lot more words than are needed",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thank you for providing such a detailed description of your symptoms. It's important to address both of these issues with a healthcare professional as soon as possible. Here's a breakdown of what your descriptions suggest, and why medical evaluation is crucial:\n\n**1. Potential Orthostatic Intolerance (Possible POTS) and Heart Rate Discrepancy:**\n\n*   **Symptoms:** The significant difference between your resting and standing heart rate, along with dizziness, vision changes (fading, spots) upon standing, are suggestive of orthostatic intolerance. POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) is a common type of orthostatic intolerance, but it's not the only possibility.\n*   **POTS vs. Other Orthostatic Issues:** While you mention you don't faint or sweat profusely, these symptoms aren't required for a diagnosis of orthostatic intolerance. The diagnostic criterion for POTS is a sustained increase in heart rate of 30 beats per minute (bpm) or more (or \u226540 bpm in those aged 12\u201319 years) within 10 minutes of standing, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension.\n*   **Why it Needs Evaluation:** It's important to rule out underlying causes for the heart rate changes and orthostatic symptoms. These could include:\n    *   **Dehydration:** Relatively easy to correct.\n    *   **Medications:** Certain medications can affect blood pressure and heart rate.\n    *   **Underlying cardiac conditions:** While less likely, a thorough checkup is necessary.\n    *   **Autonomic nervous system dysfunction:** POTS is one form of this, but there can be other issues.\n    *   **Low blood pressure:** Which can be caused by numerous things\n\n**2. \"Blackouts\" or Transient Loss of Consciousness (TLOC) with Associated Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Symptoms:** The detailed description of the episodes with nausea, feeling cold and sweating, muffled hearing, vision tunneling leading to complete loss of consciousness and memory (\"acting like a zombie\"), is concerning.\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Consideration:** You are right to be concerned about TIAs, especially given your family history of stroke. While the absence of unilateral weakness is a point against TIA, it's important to know that TIAs can present with a variety of symptoms. The symptoms described (altered consciousness, visual changes, sensory changes) *can* be associated with TIAs, especially those affecting the vertebrobasilar circulation.\n*   **Epilepsy Possibility:** You also mentioned some results from epilepsy, which is another important consideration. Complex partial seizures, for example, can cause altered awareness, automatisms (repetitive movements), and sensory symptoms.\n*   **Other possibilities:** There are multiple possible causes, including:\n    * **Syncope:** Usually involves fainting, but not always.\n    * **Migraine:** Can be related to the symptoms.\n    * **Metabolic Problems:**\n*   **Why it's Critically Important to Investigate:** These episodes require immediate investigation to rule out serious conditions like:\n    *   **TIA/Stroke:** Time is of the essence in treating strokes.\n    *   **Seizures:** Identifying the type of seizures and providing appropriate treatment is crucial.\n    *   **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Irregular heart rhythms can cause loss of consciousness.\n    *   **Other neurological conditions:**\n\n**Relationship Between the Two Issues:**\n\nIt's possible that the orthostatic intolerance and the \"blackout\" episodes are related, but it's equally possible that they are separate issues. Some conditions can cause both orthostatic intolerance and seizures or syncope (fainting). For example, certain types of cardiac arrhythmias or autonomic disorders could potentially manifest in both ways.\n\n**Additional Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Heat Sensitivity and Excessive Sweating:** These symptoms *could* be related to autonomic dysfunction, which could link to the POTS-like symptoms. However, they could also be separate issues.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor Immediately:** Do not delay seeking medical attention. This is not something that can be diagnosed or treated online. You need a thorough physical exam and diagnostic testing.\n2.  **Specific Doctor Recommendations:**\n    *   **Start with your Primary Care Physician (PCP):** Your PCP can assess your overall health and refer you to specialists.\n    *   **Cardiologist:** To evaluate your heart function and rule out cardiac causes.\n    *   **Neurologist:** To investigate the \"blackout\" episodes and rule out neurological conditions.\n    *   **Electrophysiologist:** If heart problems are suspected, this can be helpful\n3.  **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:** Before your appointment, start documenting the following:\n    *   **Frequency and duration of all symptoms.**\n    *   **Specific triggers for each symptom (e.g., standing up, specific activities, stress).**\n    *   **What you were doing immediately before the episodes.**\n    *   **What helps alleviate the symptoms.**\n    *   **Food and water intake.**\n    *   **Medications you are taking.**\n4.  **Diagnostic Tests:** Expect the following tests:\n    *   **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** To assess heart rhythm.\n    *   **Holter Monitor:** For continuous heart rhythm monitoring over 24-48 hours.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To rule out metabolic issues, anemia, and other potential causes.\n    *   **Tilt Table Test:** To evaluate your body's response to changes in position (specifically for orthostatic intolerance).\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** To assess brain activity and rule out seizures.\n    *   **Brain MRI or CT Scan:** To rule out structural abnormalities in the brain.\n    *   **Autonomic Testing:** Tests to evaluate the function of your autonomic nervous system.\n5.  **Inform Your Family:** Share this information with your family or someone close to you so they can advocate for you and provide support.  They may also be able to offer insights into what you're like during the episodes.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nThis information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with qualified healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment. Self-treating can be dangerous. The information above should be considered a starting point for discussions with your doctor, not a replacement for their expertise.\n"

    "question": "18M 72kg/160lbs 180cm healthy non-smoker and non-drinker. My blood pressure normally around 55/110 and my mother has epilepsy. I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, given the information you've provided, it's impossible to say definitively whether you had an epileptic seizure or a syncopal episode (fainting) or some combination of both. However, the details you and your friend described warrant a medical evaluation. Here's a breakdown of why and what to consider:\n\n**Why a Medical Evaluation is Necessary:**\n\n*   **Loss of Consciousness (LOC):** Any unexplained loss of consciousness should be investigated by a doctor.\n*   **Family History of Epilepsy:** Your mother's epilepsy significantly increases your risk of developing it.\n*   **Abnormal Movements:** The leg swinging and scratching movements during the LOC are concerning and can be associated with seizures.\n*   **Hyperventilation:** While hyperventilation can cause fainting, it can also trigger seizures in some individuals.\n*   **Foggy Feeling Post-Event:** This is common after both seizures and fainting, but it doesn't differentiate between the two.\n*   **Low Blood Pressure:** Your blood pressure is already on the low side, which can make you more prone to fainting, but also it is worth mentioning that post-seizure your blood pressure can be low.\n*   **Dream While Unconscious:** Brief dreams can occur during both fainting and seizures.\n\n**Possible Scenarios and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Syncope (Fainting):**\n    *   Hyperventilation can lead to a drop in blood pressure and fainting.\n    *   Standing up quickly after hyperventilating can exacerbate this.\n    *   Usually, fainting is brief, and recovery is relatively quick.\n    *   However, prolonged lack of blood flow to the brain *can* sometimes cause brief, seizure-like movements.\n*   **Epileptic Seizure:**\n    *   Hyperventilation is a known trigger for seizures in susceptible individuals.\n    *   The described movements (leg swinging, scratching) are suggestive of a focal seizure with motor symptoms.\n    *   The foggy feeling afterward is also consistent with a post-ictal state (the period after a seizure).\n*   **Atypical Syncope with Seizure-like Activity:** It's possible you fainted, and the lack of oxygen to the brain triggered some abnormal motor activity that mimicked a seizure.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor Immediately:** Do not delay. Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or go to an urgent care clinic as soon as possible. Explain what happened in detail and mention your mother's epilepsy.\n2.  **Neurological Evaluation:** Your doctor will likely refer you to a neurologist (a doctor specializing in the brain and nervous system).\n3.  **Diagnostic Tests:** The neurologist may order tests to help determine the cause of the event, including:\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This test measures brain activity and can help detect seizure activity. It's best done as soon as possible after the event.\n    *   **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** To evaluate your heart's electrical activity and rule out heart-related causes of fainting.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for any underlying medical conditions.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** To rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n4.  **Avoid Potential Triggers:** Until you have a diagnosis, try to avoid situations that might trigger another episode, such as:\n    *   Hyperventilation\n    *   Sudden changes in posture (standing up quickly)\n    *   Dehydration\n    *   Skipping meals\n    *   Excessive stress\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** Depending on the diagnosis and local laws, you may be restricted from driving until you are seizure-free for a certain period. Discuss this with your doctor.\n*   **Safety:** Take precautions to avoid injury if you were to have another episode. Avoid situations where a loss of consciousness could be dangerous (e.g., swimming alone, climbing ladders).\n\n**In summary, the combination of your family history, the description of the event, and the post-event symptoms makes it crucial to seek medical attention to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.** Don't try to diagnose yourself based on online information. A proper evaluation by a doctor is essential.\n"

    "question": "Female, 47, 65kg, 1.62cm, no other medicine or illness until thus far. No smoke, drinking, children or cases in the family.Up until I was 7 I took Gardenal. Then stopped - and my late granduncle was the top pediatric neurologist in the country - and did EEGs yearly until about 25.Had deja-vus up until college, never thought they could be considered related to epilepsy.When I was 45, epidemic, worst job in the world. Colleagues were in Rio, London, Lagos and Dubai. My sleep pattern went haywire, and I turned to Zolpidem to give me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Started at 5mg. As pressure grew, isolation, trouble in the job, slowly I grew the dosage. Had a burnout, left the job, and now I was taking 500mg to 600mg a day. Yes, 2 to 3 boxes. A day. I was floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid.Then I started having tonic-clonics. 8 in few months. I was deeply scared and built a team of therapist, psychologist and neurologist. Good news, nothing physical in the brain. Other good news is that I quit Zolpidem cold turkey, had withdrawal, suffered a lot... But quit.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing your detailed and personal experience. It sounds like you've been through a very challenging period and have taken significant steps to address your health. Let's break down the situation and discuss potential next steps:\n\n**Key Takeaways from Your History:**\n\n*   **Past Gardenal Use:** Your childhood use of Gardenal (phenobarbital), an anti-seizure medication, strongly suggests a history of epilepsy, even if your EEGs were clear after cessation.\n*   **Deja-vus:** Your experience with deja-vus before may indicate focal seizures.\n*   **Zolpidem Abuse:** The escalating Zolpidem dosage and the subsequent tonic-clonic seizures are extremely concerning. Zolpidem, while intended for short-term insomnia, can significantly lower the seizure threshold, especially at high doses and during withdrawal.\n*   **Withdrawal Symptoms:** Quitting Zolpidem cold turkey was undoubtedly difficult and potentially dangerous, given the risk of seizures during withdrawal. *Withdrawal of Zolipidem should always be done with medical assistance.*\n*   **No Physical Brain Abnormality:** The neurological examination that found nothing physical is reassuring.\n*   **Building a Support Team:** That you have a therapist, psychologist, and neurologist is excellent.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nBased on the information you've provided, here's a possible interpretation:\n\n1.  **Underlying Epilepsy:** It's highly probable that you have an underlying predisposition to epilepsy, possibly controlled by Gardenal in childhood. Even if past EEGs were normal, that doesn't rule out epilepsy. EEGs can be normal between seizures.\n2.  **Zolpidem-Induced Seizures:** The high doses of Zolpidem likely triggered or unmasked your epilepsy. While the seizures *could* be solely due to Zolpidem toxicity and withdrawal, the previous use of Gardenal and deja-vu episodes makes underlying epilepsy more likely.\n3.  **Withdrawal Seizures:** The seizures could also be specifically related to Zolpidem withdrawal.\n4.  **Importance of Ruling Out Other Causes:** While the most likely explanation is related to Zolpidem, it's crucial to rule out other potential causes for seizures.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Consult with Your Neurologist About Diagnosis:** Discuss your childhood history of Gardenal use and previous deja-vu experiences with your neurologist. This information, combined with the recent tonic-clonic seizures, may lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy. The neurologist would be in the position to ask for complementary exams in order to arrive at a diagnostic.\n*   **EEG Again:** If you haven't had one recently, a repeat EEG is recommended, even if previous ones were normal. Consider a sleep-deprived EEG, as sleep deprivation can sometimes provoke seizure activity.\n*   **Medication for Epilepsy:** The neurologist will likely consider starting you on an anti-seizure medication (ASM). Several effective ASMs are available, and the choice will depend on your specific situation and potential side effects.\n*   **Follow Up and Treatment:** Adherence to the ASM, plus other measures like avoiding alcohol, and lack of sleep should improve the patient\u00b4s overall quality of life.\n*   **Psychological Support:** Continue with your therapist and psychologist. Dealing with a new diagnosis of epilepsy (if confirmed), past substance abuse, and stress requires ongoing support.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:** Focus on establishing healthy sleep habits *without* medication. This includes:\n    *   Regular sleep-wake schedule\n    *   Dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment\n    *   Avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed\n    *   Relaxing bedtime routine\n    *   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I): This is a highly effective therapy for insomnia that does not involve medication.\n*   **Substance Abuse Counseling:** Even though you've successfully stopped Zolpidem, consider ongoing counseling to prevent relapse and address the underlying reasons for its use.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be restricted from driving after having seizures. Discuss this with your neurologist and your local Department of Motor Vehicles (or equivalent).\n*   **Safety:** Take precautions to prevent injury if you have another seizure. This might include avoiding activities where a loss of consciousness could be dangerous (e.g., swimming alone, climbing ladders).\n\n**Crucial Note:**\n\n*This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with your neurologist and other healthcare providers for accurate diagnoses, treatment options, and personalized medical advice.*\n\nYou have taken courageous steps toward improving your health. Continue to work closely with your medical team and follow their recommendations.\n"

    "question": "I (30F) had a seizure for the first time 3 days ago. I had had a couple beers, smoked a joint, and did some shrooms (none of which is unusual for me). I have no family history of epilepsy, and am in generally good health.I was checked out by paramedics immediately after the seizure who said I looked fine and it was probably from the shrooms. I went to my PCP the next day and she ordered a couple blood tests which all came back normal. I am waiting for brain imaging to be approved by my insurance.Now it\u2019s three days later and I still feel exhausted and weak and slow. I could barely get through my workday today. Is this normal? Is extreme fatigue indicative of something?Also I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant at all but about a month ago I started experiencing extreme nausea to the point I was calling off sick at work, vomiting in the middle of the day, and had just had a doctors appointment to discuss that the week before.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. Experiencing a seizure for the first time is always concerning, and it's good you're taking steps to investigate it. The combination of substances you used makes determining the exact cause more complex.\n\n**Is the Fatigue Normal After a Seizure?**\n\n*   **Yes, extreme fatigue and weakness are very common after a seizure.** This is called the \"postictal state.\" It's a period of altered consciousness following a seizure, and symptoms can vary significantly from person to person.\n*   **Common Postictal Symptoms:** Fatigue, confusion, headache, muscle soreness, weakness (sometimes localized), difficulty speaking, memory loss, and general slowness.\n*   **Duration:** The postictal state can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, or even a day or two, especially after a first seizure. So, feeling exhausted three days later isn't entirely unexpected, although it's good you're monitoring it.\n\n**Could the Fatigue Indicate Something More?**\n\nWhile postictal fatigue is common, it's essential to consider other possibilities:\n\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** You haven't mentioned being on anti-seizure medication, but if you *do* start any, fatigue is a common side effect of many.\n*   **Underlying Medical Condition:** The seizure itself could be a symptom of an underlying medical condition (brain tumor, vascular malformation, etc.), which is why the brain imaging is important.\n*   **Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance:** Seizures can sometimes lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can contribute to fatigue.\n*   **Stress and Anxiety:** Experiencing a seizure is a stressful event. Anxiety and stress can exacerbate fatigue.\n*   **Substance Withdrawal/Effects:** The after effects of the substances you took could be playing a role, even days later.\n*   **Sleep Deprivation:** The stress and anxiety following the event could have disrupted sleep, contributing to fatigue.\n\n**The Nausea Connection**\n\nThe nausea you experienced a month ago *could* be related, although it's hard to say definitively without further investigation. Here are some possibilities:\n\n*   **Prodromal Symptoms:** In some cases, people experience subtle symptoms (called a \"prodrome\") *before* a seizure. Nausea could potentially be a prodromal symptom for some individuals.\n*   **Unrelated Condition:** The nausea might be completely unrelated to the seizure and due to another gastrointestinal issue, migraine, medication, or other cause. It's important to consider other potential reasons for the nausea.\n*   **Anxiety/Stress:** As mentioned above, the anxiety and stress following a seizure, and even just the possibility of having a seizure, can trigger nausea.\n*   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Electrolyte imbalances can cause both seizures and nausea.\n\n**What to Do**\n\n1.  **Continue with the Neurological Workup:** The brain imaging is crucial. Make sure you follow up diligently with your doctors to get this scheduled and interpreted.\n2.  **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed journal of your symptoms, including:\n    *   Severity and type of fatigue (physical, mental)\n    *   Any other symptoms (headaches, muscle aches, cognitive difficulties, mood changes)\n    *   Timing of symptoms\n    *   Factors that make them better or worse\n    *   Frequency and severity of nausea.\n3.  **Communicate with Your Doctor:** Tell your doctor about the ongoing fatigue and the previous nausea. Emphasize the impact these symptoms are having on your daily life.\n4.  **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Prioritize Rest:** Get adequate sleep.\n    *   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of fluids.\n    *   **Eat Nutritiously:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n    *   **Avoid Alcohol and Recreational Drugs:** At least until you have a better understanding of what triggered the seizure.\n    *   **Manage Stress:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n5.  **Consider a Neurologist:** If your PCP is not a neurologist, it would be helpful to seek a referral to one. Neurologists are specialists in brain and nervous system disorders and can provide more in-depth evaluation and management.\n6.  **Do NOT drive:** Until cleared to do so by your physician.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding the Substances Used**\n\nIt's important to be honest with your doctor about your substance use. While the paramedics may have attributed the seizure to the shrooms, the combination of alcohol, marijuana, and psilocybin can significantly increase the risk of seizures.\n\n*   **Alcohol:** In some people, alcohol withdrawal can trigger seizures.\n*   **Marijuana:** The effects of marijuana on seizure threshold are complex and not fully understood. While some studies suggest it may have anticonvulsant properties in certain cases, it can also potentially lower the seizure threshold in others.\n*   **Psilocybin (Shrooms):** While seizures are not a common side effect of psilocybin, they have been reported, especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions or when combined with other substances.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe fatigue you're experiencing is likely related to the postictal state after the seizure. However, it's essential to investigate other potential causes, especially given the history of nausea and the use of multiple substances. Be proactive in communicating with your doctor, keeping a detailed symptom journal, and following through with the recommended neurological workup. Avoiding alcohol and recreational drugs is advisable until you have a clearer understanding of the cause of the seizure.\n*This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "33f/5\u20193\u201d/185lbs/no major health issuesWhat I\u2019ve been experiencing: Out of nowhere my eyes get super sensitive to light. I will get an overwhelming sensation of doom/panic. My body basically forgets how to breathe. Heart rate goes up. My brain feels weird, dizzy, and fuzzy. I get hot and nauseous. I just don\u2019t feel ok, something in my head just feels very off and I\u2019m scared. These episodes last for a few seconds to a few minutes. I don\u2019t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it\u2019s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It\u2019s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn\u2019t the same feeling. I\u2019ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn\u2019t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area. At night when I try to sleep it sometimes it feels like my eyes and brain are about to move side to side\u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a box and someone is shaking it diagonally. Makes me dizzy as all hell and my body feels it too. That has happened a handful of times in my life in the past and I went years without it happening and it\u2019s back, and it\u2019s scary and feels horrible. Shaking my head hard helps stop it when I feel it coming on.Does what I\u2019m experiencing sound like focal seizure/epilepsy? I\u2019m really nervous about this. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s all because of the trazodone or if I had this since I was a kid (since I\u2019ve experienced that weird shaking in a box sensation multiple times through my life) and the trazodone made it all come to the surface?Meds I take: klonopin 1mg, vitamin d, probiotic, melatonin 2mg, trazodone 25mg.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your symptoms and consider potential causes. It's crucial to see a doctor for a definitive diagnosis, but I can offer some insights based on the information you've provided.\n\n**Symptoms Suggestive of Focal Seizures/Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Sudden onset of light sensitivity:** While light sensitivity can have many causes, it can also be a part of a seizure aura.\n*   **Overwhelming sensation of doom/panic:** This can occur during focal seizures, particularly those originating in the temporal lobe.\n*   **Body forgets how to breathe:** This is alarming and could be related to seizure activity affecting the autonomic nervous system.\n*   **Heart rate increase:** This is a common physiological response during seizures.\n*   **Dizziness, fuzzy brain:** These sensations are frequently reported by individuals experiencing seizures.\n*   **Nausea:** Can be associated with seizures, especially if the seizure originates in certain areas of the brain.\n*   **Headaches:** Postictal headaches (headaches after a seizure) are common.\n*   **Tinnitus:** While often benign, tinnitus can sometimes be associated with neurological conditions.\n*   **Weird eyesight/floaters:** Visual disturbances can occur during or after seizures.\n*   **Short-term memory problems:** Memory issues can be a symptom of epilepsy, especially if seizures are frequent or affect the temporal lobes.\n*   **Difficulty reading aloud:** Could indicate a problem with language processing, which can be affected by seizures.\n*   **Muscle twitches (below lip/chin):** Myoclonic jerks or focal motor activity can be a sign of seizure activity.\n*   **The \"shaking in a box\" sensation:** This is a particularly concerning symptom and needs to be evaluated. While it may have other causes, it is often linked to neurological activity.\n\n**Why Focal Seizures/Epilepsy Should Be Considered:**\n\nThe combination of these symptoms, especially the \"shaking in a box\" sensation, the sudden onset of the other symptoms, and the sensation of doom/panic, strongly suggests the possibility of focal seizures. Focal seizures can manifest in many ways, and the symptoms can be quite varied depending on the location in the brain where the seizure originates. The fact that you've experienced the \"shaking in a box\" sensation multiple times over your life could point to a long-standing underlying issue.\n\n**Other Potential Considerations:**\n\n*   **Medication Side Effects:**\n\n    *   **Trazodone:** While less likely, trazodone can sometimes cause dizziness, confusion, and visual disturbances.  It can rarely lower the seizure threshold, which means it could potentially make someone more susceptible to seizures, but it is uncommon.\n    *   **Klonopin:** While Klonopin (clonazepam) is an anti-anxiety medication and also an anti-seizure medication, abrupt withdrawal can cause seizures. You are taking a relatively low dose of klonopin, so it is unlikely that the klonopin itself is the cause of these events, however it's important to mention.\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** Some of your symptoms, particularly the visual disturbances and headaches, could be related to migraine with aura. However, the panic/doom sensation and breathing difficulties are less typical of migraine.\n*   **Vestibular Issues:** The \"shaking in a box\" sensation could potentially be related to a vestibular disorder (inner ear problem), but the other symptoms make this less likely.\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Disorder:** While you state this is different from your usual anxiety, it's still important to consider that anxiety can sometimes manifest in unusual ways. However, the other symptoms, especially the \"shaking in a box\" sensation, make this less likely to be solely anxiety-related.\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are other, less common, neurological conditions that could potentially cause these symptoms.\n\n**What You Should Do Immediately:**\n\n1.  **Schedule an Appointment with a Doctor, Preferably a Neurologist:**  It is imperative to consult with a medical professional, ideally a neurologist. Describe your symptoms in detail, including the frequency, duration, and triggers (if any).\n2.  **Document Your Episodes:** Keep a detailed log of when these episodes occur, what you were doing beforehand, the specific symptoms you experienced, and how long they lasted. This information will be invaluable for your doctor.\n3.  **Do Not Drive or Operate Heavy Machinery:** Until you have a diagnosis and your condition is under control, it is important to avoid activities that could be dangerous if you were to have an episode.\n4.  **Medication Review:** Discuss all of your medications with your doctor, including the trazodone and klonopin, to determine if they could be contributing to your symptoms. Do NOT stop taking any medication without your doctor's guidance.\n5.  **Possible Tests:** Be prepared for your doctor to order tests such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to measure brain activity, an MRI of the brain to look for any structural abnormalities, and possibly blood tests to rule out other medical conditions.\n\n**Regarding Trazodone:**\n\nIt is unlikely that the trazodone is causing epilepsy. However, it *is* possible that it could be lowering your seizure threshold and making you more susceptible to seizures if you already have an underlying tendency. Discuss this with your doctor. They may want to try a different medication for sleep if seizures are suspected.\n\n**In summary, your symptoms are concerning and warrant prompt medical evaluation. It is important to see a doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment. Do not delay seeking medical attention.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

MRI and CT scans normal. Neurolgist reported on EEH as \u2019essentially normal\u2019 with no other details, but has advised GP diagnosis is presumed epilepsy however described it as a difficult case to diagnose. My question is why would he describe the EEG as \u2018essentially normal\u2019 rather than just normal?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "That's a very understandable question, and it's good you're trying to understand the nuances of your neurologist's communication. Here's a breakdown of why the neurologist might use \"essentially normal\" instead of just \"normal,\" especially given your complex clinical picture:\n\n*   **Acknowledging Clinical Suspicion Despite Normal EEG:**\n    *   **Epilepsy is a Clinical Diagnosis:** Epilepsy is often diagnosed based on clinical history (your witnessed seizures) even if the EEG doesn't definitively show epileptiform activity (seizure-related brain waves). The neurologist is likely acknowledging the strong clinical suspicion of epilepsy based on your partner's observations and videos.\n    *   **EEG as a Snapshot:** An EEG only captures brain activity for a relatively short period. Seizures can be infrequent, or the epileptiform activity might be brief and occur between recording sessions. A \"normal\" EEG doesn't *rule out* epilepsy, it just means no seizure activity was caught *during the recording*.\n    *   **Interictal Discharges:** Even between seizures, some people with epilepsy have abnormal brain wave patterns (interictal discharges) on their EEG. If your EEG was truly \"normal,\" it means you didn't have these either. The absence of interictal discharges makes the diagnosis less certain but doesn't eliminate the possibility of epilepsy.\n\n*   **Subtleties in Interpretation:**\n    *   **Subjectivity:** EEG interpretation isn't always completely objective. There can be subtle findings that one neurologist might consider borderline or nonspecific, while another might consider them more significant. \"Essentially normal\" could mean there were some very minor, questionable findings, but not enough to confidently call the EEG abnormal.\n    *   **Muscle Artifact:** Due to the Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) which can lead to muscle weakness and instability this can lead to muscle spasms or jerks and these can interfere with the interpretation of EEG and create difficulties in interpretation.\n\n*   **Specificity of seizure focus:**\n    *   **Some types of epilepsy and seizure types are less likely to show on EEG:** Seizures originating from deep brain structures are less likely to appear on a scalp EEG.\n\n*   **Communication of Uncertainty:**\n    *   **Managing Expectations:** The neurologist is likely being cautious and transparent. \"Essentially normal\" prepares you for the possibility that the diagnosis might need further investigation or refinement. It avoids giving you the impression that everything is completely ruled out.\n    *   **Documenting the Decision-Making:** The phrase protects the neurologist as well. By documenting \"essentially normal,\" they are acknowledging that the EEG is not definitively diagnostic while still justifying the presumptive diagnosis based on other clinical factors.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n\"Essentially normal\" means the EEG wasn't clearly abnormal, but:\n\n*   Doesn't negate the strong clinical suspicion of epilepsy based on your seizures.\n*   Could mean the EEG was technically normal but with very minor, questionable findings.\n*   Allows for continued observation and potential adjustments to the diagnosis.\n*   Reflects the limitations of EEG as a diagnostic tool for epilepsy.\n*   Acknowledge complexities due to Ehlers Danlos and potential impact on muscular activity\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n1.  **Clarify with Your Neurologist:** The best course of action is to directly ask your neurologist to elaborate on what they meant by \"essentially normal.\" Ask:\n    *   \"Were there any subtle findings on the EEG that you considered but didn't think were definitively epileptiform?\"\n    *   \"Does the 'essentially normal' EEG change your confidence in the presumed epilepsy diagnosis, given my symptoms?\"\n    *   \"Are there any other tests or monitoring that might be helpful in clarifying the diagnosis?\"\n\n2.  **Continue Monitoring:** Keep a detailed seizure diary to track your symptoms, frequency, duration, and any potential triggers. This information is invaluable for your neurologist.\n\n3.  **Discuss Levetiracetam Response:** Talk to your neurologist about the fact that the Levetiracetam has reduced, but not eliminated, your seizures. They might consider adjusting the dosage or trying a different medication.\n\nIt's important to remember that epilepsy diagnosis can be challenging, and it's often a process of gathering information and adjusting treatment based on your response. Open communication with your neurologist is key.\n"

    "question": "I want to donate plasma, partially because I have O negative blood and would be available every 4 weeks to donate. And partially because I discovered donating plasma also has health benefits for the donors such as reducing micro-plastics in the body.From what I can see online in the UK if you\u2019re epileptic you can\u2019t donate plasma/blood. I was wondering if anyone knew the reason for this? Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a \u2018we\u2019re worried you may have a seizure while donating\u2019 kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it\u2019s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn\u2019t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can\u2019t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're curious about the specific reasons behind the UK's restriction on blood and plasma donation for people with epilepsy. It's not always clearly stated, and it's frustrating when you feel you could potentially contribute and benefit.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the likely reasons, and why getting specific clarification is important:\n\n**Likely Reasons for the Restriction:**\n\n*   **Donor Safety (Primary Concern):**\n    *   **Seizure Risk:** The main concern is the potential for a seizure during the donation process. The process of blood or plasma donation can sometimes cause lightheadedness, changes in blood pressure, or other physiological stressors that *could* potentially trigger a seizure in a person with epilepsy. The donation environment isn't always ideally suited to handle a seizure, and a seizure could complicate the donation procedure. Even if your seizures are well-controlled, the risk, however small, is likely deemed unacceptable by the blood/plasma donation services.\n    *   **Medication Effects on the Donor:** While your medication is keeping your epilepsy in check, donating could potentially impact how much of the medication is in your system. This is because a significant amount of blood/plasma is being removed, which could potentially lead to the medication being less effective and increase the risk of seizure.\n    *   **Stress:** The donation process, while generally safe, can be stressful for some people. Stress can be a trigger for seizures in some individuals.\n\n*   **Recipient Safety (Secondary, but Still a Factor):**\n    *   **Medication in the Blood/Plasma:** The anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) you take (Keppra and Eslicarbazepine) will be present in your plasma. While the concentrations might be low, there's a theoretical risk of adverse effects in the recipient, especially if they are a child, elderly, or have other health conditions. While this risk is likely very low, blood/plasma donation services aim to minimize any potential harm.\n    *   **Antibodies:** Although less relevant to epilepsy, the donation services may be concerned with your blood interfering with people who are in an already ill state. For example, people who have been through transplants, chemotherapy and surgery. As such they try to only use blood and plasma that is as healthy as possible.\n\n**Why a Doctor's Note Might *Not* Be Enough:**\n\nWhile a doctor's note outlining your controlled condition *might* seem like it should be enough, blood and plasma donation services operate under strict guidelines and regulations. These guidelines are often risk-averse. Even if your neurologist believes the risk is minimal, the donation service must adhere to its established protocols, which likely prohibit donations from individuals with epilepsy, regardless of seizure control.\n\n**Microplastics Claim:**\n\nThe claim about reducing microplastics is a very new, ongoing study that is showing some promising results. However, it is too early to say that donating can reduce microplastics in the body with the full knowledge that they are in fact reduced.\n\n**Your Best Course of Action:**\n\n1.  **Contact UK Blood Donation/Plasma Donation Services Directly:**  The best way to get a definitive answer and understand the specific rationale is to contact the relevant organizations directly. In the UK, this would be:\n    *   **NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT):** They handle blood donation.  Inquire specifically about plasma donation as well, as some rules might differ.\n    *   **Private Plasma Donation Centers:** If you are looking to donate plasma for compensation, you can contact a private plasma donation clinic and ask them about their specific criteria and protocols.\n\n    Ask them:\n    *   What is the *specific* reason for the exclusion of people with epilepsy?\n    *   Is there *any* possibility of an exception with a neurologist's approval or under specific circumstances?\n    *   Are there any ongoing studies or reviews of the guidelines regarding epilepsy and donation?\n2.  **Discuss with Your Neurologist:**  Have a detailed discussion with your neurologist. They can provide a professional assessment of your individual risk profile related to donation and can potentially write a letter supporting your request, *if* they believe it's safe and appropriate.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Transparency:**  Be completely honest with the donation service about your medical history and medications.\n*   **Regulations:**  Blood/plasma donation is heavily regulated.  The donation service must adhere to these regulations to ensure the safety of both donors and recipients.\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** Blood/plasma donation services must prioritize safety above all else.\n\nWhile it's frustrating, the restrictions are in place to protect everyone involved. Getting direct clarification from the UK blood/plasma donation services will give you the most accurate understanding of the situation.\n\n"

    "question": "My friend is 19 and pregnant. She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a concerning situation for your friend, and it's understandable that you're looking for advice. Here's a breakdown of potential issues and some suggestions, but **remember, I am not a medical professional. This information should not replace the advice of qualified doctors. Your friend needs thorough medical evaluation and management.**\n\n**Possible Causes & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Eclampsia/Pre-eclampsia:** Given her pregnancy and the \"seizure\"-like activity, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia is a major concern. Even without a history of epilepsy, pregnancy can trigger seizures. Key indicators would be:\n    *   **High Blood Pressure:** Doctors should be diligently monitoring her blood pressure.\n    *   **Proteinuria:** Testing her urine for protein is crucial.\n    *   **Edema:** Swelling, especially in the hands, feet, and face.\n    *   Eclampsia is a medical emergency. It means pre-eclampsia is leading to seizures.\n\n*   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Low magnesium is significant. Magnesium plays a vital role in nerve and muscle function. The doctors are likely addressing this, but it's worth knowing how aggressively they're replacing it. Other electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium) also need to be carefully checked.\n\n*   **Hypoxia (Low Oxygen):** The 93% oxygen saturation, especially when she's dizzy, is borderline. Normal is usually 95% or higher. This could be contributing to the neurological symptoms. Possible causes:\n    *   **Pulmonary Embolism:** A blood clot in the lungs. Pregnancy increases the risk.\n    *   **Pneumonia/Respiratory Infection:**\n    *   **Asthma:** If she has a history of asthma, pregnancy can sometimes worsen it.\n    *   **Underlying Lung Condition:**\n\n*   **Cardiac Issues:** Although less likely given her age, heart problems can sometimes manifest with unusual neurological symptoms.\n\n*   **Metabolic Disorders:** Pregnancy can sometimes unmask underlying metabolic disorders.\n\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** While it's important to rule out medical causes first, PNES can mimic epileptic seizures but are related to psychological distress rather than abnormal brain activity. The lack of pain during the event, but pain afterward, *could* point to this, but it's essential to exhaust all other possibilities first.\n\n*   **Sepsis History:** Her previous sepsis episode is relevant. While the current symptoms might not be directly related, sepsis can sometimes have long-term effects on the body.\n\n**Recommendations and Advice:**\n\n1.  **Advocate for a Second Opinion:** If your friend and her family are not satisfied with the current answers or feel the doctors aren't taking their concerns seriously, push for a second opinion from a maternal-fetal medicine specialist (perinatologist) or a neurologist experienced in pregnancy-related neurological issues.\n\n2.  **Detailed Documentation:** Encourage her or a family member to keep a very detailed log of the episodes:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   What she was doing before the episode\n    *   Duration of the episode\n    *   Specific symptoms (dizziness, confusion, amnesia, what she experiences during the \"seizure\")\n    *   What helps to stop it (if anything)\n    *   Symptoms *after* the episode (pain, headache, etc.)\n    *   Record her oxygen saturations.\n    *   Record everything in a notebook and give to her medical team.\n\n3.  **Question the Doctors Directly:**\n    *   Ask specifically about the possibility of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and what steps they are taking to rule it out.\n    *   Inquire about their plan for addressing the low magnesium and oxygen saturation. What's the target level for magnesium? What's causing the low oxygen?\n    *   Ask what other conditions they are considering and what tests they are doing to rule them out.\n    *   Ask if imaging like an MRI or CT scan (with appropriate precautions for pregnancy) is being considered.\n\n4.  **Medication Review:** Ensure the doctors are aware of all medications and supplements she's taking.\n\n5.  **Support System:** Be there for your friend. Pregnancy is already stressful, and this situation is incredibly frightening. Offer practical help, emotional support, and help her advocate for herself with the medical team.\n\n6.  **Trust Your Instincts:** If something doesn't feel right, don't be afraid to push for more answers or seek a different opinion.\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n*   **Time is of the Essence:** If it *is* eclampsia, it's a life-threatening emergency for both your friend and the baby. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical.\n*   **Communication is Key:** Encourage open and honest communication between your friend, her family, and the medical team.\n\nThis is a difficult situation. By being informed, supportive, and advocating for her, you can help your friend get the best possible care. I hope she gets answers and the treatment she needs soon.\n"

    "question": "22F, 110 poundsCurrent Medications- Lamictal 200 mg in the AM & PM so 400mg total a day. Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and address your questions. It's understandable that you're still trying to piece together and understand the events from when you were 15, as well as the ongoing management of your seizures.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation:**\n\n*   **Dextromethorphan (DXM) Toxicity:** Taking a massive overdose of Coricidin (which contains DXM, an antitussive) could absolutely lead to psychosis and subsequent neurological issues. DXM in high doses can cause brain damage, and can also impact other organs.\n*   **Psychosis After Overdose:** The psychotic episode you experienced was likely a direct result of the DXM toxicity. It's not uncommon for severe drug overdoses to trigger psychosis, particularly if there's a pre-existing vulnerability.\n*   **Seizures and Lesion:** The seizures developed after the DXM overdose. Lesions within the brain can disrupt normal brain activity and lower the seizure threshold.\n\n**Addressing Your Questions:**\n\n1.  **Lesion Shrinking and Seizures Stopping:**\n\n    *   **Possible but Complex:** It is *theoretically* possible for a brain lesion to shrink or become less active over time. Brains have a certain degree of plasticity and can sometimes compensate for damage. However, it's not a guarantee, and it's also not always the case.\n    *   **Reasons for Apparent Shrinkage:** There are a few reasons why a lesion might *appear* to be smaller on a newer MRI:\n        *   **MRI Technology Differences:** Different MRI machines and imaging protocols can produce slightly different results. It's possible that the newer MRI had better resolution, or the image interpretation was different.\n        *   **Lesion Evolution:** Some lesions can change over time. Inflammation might decrease, or the lesion might consolidate. This *could* make it appear smaller.\n        *   **Subjectivity in Interpretation:** There's a degree of subjectivity in interpreting MRI images. Different radiologists might have slightly different interpretations.\n    *   **Seizures Might Not Stop:** Even if the lesion is shrinking, it doesn't automatically mean your seizures will stop. The initial damage may have created permanent changes in your brain's excitability, making you more prone to seizures. Even if the original cause is resolving, the brain might have rewired itself to be more susceptible.\n    *   **Medication Impact:** Lamotrigine works by stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, thus preventing seizures. That could explain why you notice more seizures if you miss a dose.\n\n2.  **Increased Seizure Sensitivity:**\n\n    *   **Brain Plasticity and Rewiring:** As your brain adapts to the damage caused by the initial event and your seizure disorder, it may develop new pathways or become more sensitive to triggers. This could explain why you experience more breakthrough seizures if you miss a dose now compared to when you were younger.\n    *   **Medication Tolerance:** Your body may have become accustomed to the Lamictal dosage over time.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **In-Depth Discussion with Neurologist:** The most important step is to have a detailed discussion with your neurologist about the two MRI results and the potential reasons for the perceived change in the lesion size. Ask them to:\n    *   **Compare the MRI images directly.**\n    *   **Explain the lesion's characteristics in detail.**\n    *   **Discuss the potential impact on your seizure management.**\n2.  **Medication Adherence:** Since missing a dose is now reliably triggering seizures, strict adherence to your medication schedule is crucial.\n3.  **Seizure Diary:** Keep a detailed seizure diary, noting any potential triggers (sleep deprivation, stress, missed medications, etc.). This can help you and your doctor identify patterns and adjust your treatment plan.\n4.  **Lifestyle Considerations:**\n    *   **Sleep:** Ensure you're getting adequate sleep, as sleep deprivation is a common seizure trigger.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Implement stress-reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n    *   **Medical Marijuana:** It's important to discuss your marijuana use with your neurologist. While some people with epilepsy use cannabis, it can interact with other medications and potentially affect seizure control. It is best to use this under medical supervision as it is a complex thing.\n5.  **Don't get Discouraged:** Managing epilepsy can be a long-term process, and it requires ongoing adjustments.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n"

    "question": "40 years old, 10 stone (140 pounds)Epilepsy-Asthma-Thyroid-Scoliosis-Bladder conditionMeds: Epilim chrono 500mg, Epilim 200mg, Etanercept, Ventolin, LevothyroxineI take one 200mg Epilim pill in the morning and two 500mg ones in the evening. In the morning I take the 200mg pill with my breakfast fine, but when I take the 500mg tablet after dinner, I swallow the tablet with water like in the morning, I'm coughing up the water and the pill is getting lodged in my throat. This has been happening every other day in the last 2 weeks.I'm coughing up phelgmn and I've tried warm water to force the pill down as it is a enteric-coated pill, which reacts with water straight away. The longer the pill stays in my throat, it scrapes my throat and blood comes out with my spit. My throat is sore afterwards which takes two days to recover. I have to take my Epilepsy pills for life.I'm afraid to keep taking the 500ml tablets in the evening, as I keep having this reaction.Should I take 5 of the 200mg pills instead to make up the 1000mg required in the evening which are easier to swallow or do something else?I'm going to speak to my pharmacist and GP tomorrow morning as well about it.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's very smart of you to seek medical advice immediately. This sounds distressing and potentially dangerous, so seeing your pharmacist and GP tomorrow is the right course of action. **Do not change your medication dosage or schedule without consulting them.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is happening and what your doctor and pharmacist can help you with:\n\n**Why the Problem is Likely Happening:**\n\n*   **Pill Size and Shape:** 500mg Epilim Chrono tablets are likely larger and potentially a different shape than the 200mg tablets. This makes them harder to swallow for some people.\n*   **Esophageal Irritation:** Your coughing and bleeding suggest the pill is irritating or even slightly damaging your esophagus (the tube that carries food and pills to your stomach). Enteric coating being exposed in your throat can make the issue even more sore\n*   **Dry Mouth:** Several of your medications (including some epilepsy and asthma meds) can cause dry mouth, which makes swallowing pills more difficult.\n*   **Scoliosis:** Scoliosis can sometimes affect posture and muscle function in the upper body, potentially making swallowing more challenging for some individuals.\n*   **Asthma/Phlegm:** The presence of phlegm, potentially related to your asthma, can also obstruct the swallowing process.\n*   **Bladder condition:** Depending on your bladder condition it might mean you could be dehydrated which could lead to issues swallowing pills.\n*   **Age:** As we age, the muscles involved in swallowing can weaken slightly.\n\n**Why Seeing Your Doctor and Pharmacist is Crucial:**\n\n1.  **Dosage Change:** They need to approve ANY changes in your medication dosage. Simply taking more of the 200mg tablets *could* affect how the medication is released and absorbed, especially given the \"Chrono\" (controlled-release) formulation of the 500mg tablets. You want to maintain therapeutic levels of Epilim in your system to prevent seizures.\n2.  **Confirm Cause:** They can help determine the underlying cause of the swallowing difficulty. It could be medication-related, anatomy related (related to scoliosis), or something else entirely.\n3.  **Rule Out Serious Issues:** They need to rule out any esophageal problems (like strictures or inflammation) that might be contributing to the problem.\n4.  **Provide Alternatives:** They can explore alternative solutions, which might include:\n    *   **Different Formulation:** Is there a liquid or chewable form of Epilim that would be easier to take?\n    *   **Smaller Doses:** As you mentioned, taking more of the 200mg tablets *might* be an option *if* your doctor approves it, considering the controlled-release nature of the 500mg Chrono.\n    *   **Different Medication:** In some cases, if the swallowing problem is severe, your doctor might consider a different epilepsy medication altogether (though this is usually a last resort).\n5.  **Swallowing Techniques:** The pharmacist or doctor can give you tips on how to swallow pills more easily (see below).\n\n**What You Can Do (Until You See Them):**\n\n*   **DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION.** Missing doses of epilepsy medication can be very dangerous.\n*   **Take the 500mg pill differently tonight:** (These are general tips, not medical advice.)\n    *   **Lubricate:** Drink a large glass of water *before* and *after* you attempt to swallow the pill.\n    *   **Position:** Try sitting or standing upright, with your chin slightly tucked. This helps open up your esophagus.\n    *   **\"Pop-Bottle Method\":** Place the tablet on your tongue. Close your lips tightly around the opening of a water bottle. Suck the water in and swallow the pill at the same time without letting air into the bottle.\n    *   **\"Lean Forward\" Method:** Place the tablet on your tongue. Take a sip of water, but *before* you swallow, lean forward slightly. Then, swallow the water and pill together. Leaning forward helps to open the throat.\n    *   **Food:** Try taking the pill with a spoonful of applesauce or yogurt. The food can help \"coat\" the pill and make it slide down more easily.\n*   **Keep a Record:** Note down when the problem occurs, what you ate before taking the pill, and any other relevant details. This will help your doctor and pharmacist.\n*   **Be Prepared:** Write down all your questions and concerns for your doctor and pharmacist.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Enteric Coating:** As you mentioned, the enteric coating is designed to protect the medication from stomach acid and release it in the small intestine. Crushing or breaking the tablet could damage the coating and affect how the medication works. *Never* crush or break enteric-coated pills unless specifically instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.\n*   **Epilepsy and Consistency:** Consistency in taking your epilepsy medication is crucial for seizure control. Avoid making any changes to your dosage or schedule without medical guidance.\n*   **Etanercept:** If you find it difficult to swallow your medications, you can ask your doctor to look for different medications with alternate delivery methods, such as injections.\n\nThe information provided here is for general guidance only and does not constitute medical advice. Consulting with your pharmacist and GP is essential to address your specific situation and ensure your safety.\n"

The only question I did not get to ask him was if I have to continue only taking 1 a day since trokendi is an extended release or if I have to take 2 a day. Thanks!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you want to make sure you're taking your medication correctly, especially with a switch like this! Unfortunately, I am an AI assistant and cannot provide medical advice.\n\n**It is absolutely essential that you contact your neurologist's office or your pharmacist directly to clarify the dosing instructions for the generic topiramate.** They have your medical history and the specifics of the prescription, and they are the only ones who can give you accurate guidance.\n\nHere's why it's so important to get this information from a healthcare professional:\n\n*   **Extended-Release vs. Immediate-Release:** Trokendi XR is extended-release, meaning it releases the medication slowly over time. Generic topiramate can be immediate-release, which requires more frequent dosing. The number of times you need to take it daily (and the total daily dose) will depend on the type of topiramate you are switching to.\n*   **Dosage Adjustment:** Your neurologist likely considered the difference between extended-release and immediate-release when prescribing the generic topiramate. However, only they can tell you exactly what the new dosing schedule should be.\n*   **Avoiding Seizures or Side Effects:** Taking the wrong dose could lead to breakthrough seizures or unwanted side effects.\n\n**Do not guess or assume the correct dosage. Call your neurologist or pharmacist immediately to get clear instructions.**"

    "question": "Before I start of with everything I am diagnosed with BPD, epilepsy, anxiety, aura headaches, pcos, and vertigo. It started with me just getting vertigo in 2019 and it went away with medication but came back within a week and i got chest pains and went to see a cardiologist and everything was okay. I was then sent to a neurologist and they finally diagnosed me with epilepsy but I don't have seizures. for awhile though i was having episodes of \"falling into the ground\" feelings and if i was in the car it would feel like i was falling back. I would just get odd feelings like that. i was told i basically have micro seizures. there's times where i get dizzy and don't feel good or just don't feel right and im guessing it could just be depersonalization but I'm honestly not sure. l've been now struggling with a migraine for over a month now and i had a mri done that came out normal and im having another one and a mra done tomorrow to see if something looks off.

    "answer": "I understand you're going through a lot right now, dealing with a multitude of overlapping and often debilitating symptoms. It's incredibly frustrating and exhausting when you feel like you're constantly battling your own body. It's good you're actively seeking answers and advocating for your health.\n\nLet's break down some of the potential connections and considerations, keeping in mind I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace a consultation with your healthcare providers.\n\n**Understanding the Interplay of Your Diagnoses:**\n\nIt's important to remember that many of your diagnoses can influence each other. This is often the case with neurological and mental health conditions. Here's how some might interact:\n\n*   **BPD and Physical Symptoms:** Borderline Personality Disorder can significantly impact how you perceive and react to physical sensations. The emotional dysregulation and heightened sensitivity associated with BPD can amplify pain, dizziness, and other physical symptoms. Also, stress and anxiety (common in BPD) can trigger or worsen migraines and vertigo.\n*   **Epilepsy and Other Conditions:** Even without overt seizures, \"micro seizures\" or subclinical seizure activity can manifest in subtle ways, such as dizziness, depersonalization/derealization, and strange sensations. The antiepileptic medication (Topiramate) itself can have side effects, including cognitive changes, fatigue, and mood disturbances, which can further complicate the picture. Epilepsy can increase the risk for anxiety and depression, exacerbating BPD symptoms.\n*   **Migraines, Vertigo, and Epilepsy:** There can be some overlap between these conditions. Some types of migraines can cause vertigo (vestibular migraines). In rare cases, migraines can even trigger seizures, and vice-versa.\n*   **PCOS:** While it might seem unrelated, PCOS can contribute to insulin resistance, which can have broader effects on energy levels, mood, and potentially even headaches in some individuals.\n\n**Possible Explanations for Your Symptoms:**\n\nGiven your history and current situation, here are some things to consider:\n\n1.  **Migraine Variants/Complications:**\n    *   **Chronic Migraine:** A migraine lasting for over a month could indicate a transition to chronic migraine. Management of chronic migraine often involves a multi-faceted approach with medication, lifestyle changes, and potentially therapies like Botox or nerve blocks.\n    *   **Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** If you're using pain relievers frequently for your migraine, this could ironically be making the headaches worse. It's essential to discuss this possibility with your doctor.\n    *   **Aura Headaches:** You mentioned aura headaches, and some auras can manifest as sensory disturbances, dizziness, or even feelings of unreality. The fact that you've been getting them for a while is important to note.\n\n2.  **Side Effects and Interactions of Medications:**\n    *   **Topiramate:** Can cause a wide range of side effects, including cognitive impairment (\"brain fog\"), dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, and even mood changes.\n    *   **Venlafaxine and Bupropion:** While used to treat depression and anxiety, they can also have side effects like dizziness, insomnia, and even potentially increase seizure risk in some individuals (though this is less common).\n    *   **Aimoveg:** Generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. It's good you're noting how you feel after the injection.\n    *   **Drug Interactions:** It's crucial to ensure your doctor is aware of ALL your medications and supplements to check for potential interactions.\n\n3.  **Depersonalization/Derealization:** As you suspect, the \"not feeling right\" and dizzy spells could be related to depersonalization/derealization. This can be a symptom of anxiety disorders, BPD, or even sometimes occur as a result of seizures or migraine auras.\n\n4.  **Underlying Anxiety:** Anxiety can manifest physically in many ways, including dizziness, chest pain, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues. Given your history of anxiety and BPD, it's important to consider whether anxiety is playing a significant role in your current symptoms.\n\n5.  **Vertigo:** As vertigo has come back, and your experiences of falling, it would be beneficial to be referred to an ENT or physiotherapist who specialises in balance and vestibular issues. As your feeling that you are falling is the primary trigger and issue you may benefit from getting referred and having this properly assessed.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Medication Review:** Schedule a thorough review of all your medications with your doctor or a pharmacist. Discuss potential side effects and interactions, and explore whether any adjustments are needed.\n\n2.  **Detailed Symptom Journal:** Keep a detailed journal of your symptoms, including:\n    *   Timing, duration, and intensity of headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms\n    *   Triggers (e.g., stress, sleep deprivation, foods)\n    *   Medication use and effectiveness\n    *   Menstrual cycle (given your PCOS)\n    *   Diet and exercise habits\n\n3.  **Explore Alternative Therapies:**\n    *   **Migraine Management:** Consider options like acupuncture, massage therapy, biofeedback, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).\n    *   **Anxiety Management:** CBT, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) (often used for BPD), mindfulness, and relaxation techniques can be helpful for managing anxiety.\n    *   **Vestibular Rehabilitation:** If vertigo is a major issue, vestibular rehabilitation therapy (a type of physical therapy) can help improve balance and reduce dizziness.\n\n4.  **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Regular Sleep Schedule:** Aim for consistent sleep patterns, even on weekends.\n    *   **Healthy Diet:** Focus on whole foods, limit processed foods, and stay hydrated.\n    *   **Regular Exercise:** Even moderate exercise can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as spending time in nature, practicing yoga, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.\n\n5.  **Mental Health Support:** Continue working with a therapist who is experienced in treating BPD and anxiety. Therapy can help you develop coping skills, manage emotional dysregulation, and improve your overall quality of life.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Trust Your Gut:** If you feel like something is being missed or that your symptoms are not being adequately addressed, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another specialist.\n*   **Communicate Openly:** Be open and honest with your healthcare providers about all your symptoms, medications, and concerns. The more information they have, the better they can help you.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** You are the expert on your own body. Don't be afraid to advocate for the care you need.\n*   **Be Patient:** It can take time to find the right combination of treatments to manage your symptoms effectively. Be patient with yourself and with the process.\n\nIt is imperative you share all of this information with your doctor. By working closely with your healthcare team and actively participating in your care, you can take steps to improve your quality of life and manage your symptoms more effectively.\n"

    "question": "So i had an epilepsy seizure when i was like 4-5 months old. I took medication daily for 7 years, and i had no more seizures. Im 17 years old now. Can my epilepsy come back? If it can what can cause it?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's address your concerns about the possibility of your epilepsy returning. It's understandable to be curious and perhaps a bit anxious about this, especially given your history.\n\n**The Short Answer:** Yes, it's possible for epilepsy to return even after a long period of remission. However, the likelihood and the reasons why are complex and depend on several factors.\n\n**The More Detailed Explanation:**\n\n*   **Remission and Relapse:** After being seizure-free for a significant period, especially while on medication, doctors often consider epilepsy to be in remission. However, remission is not a guarantee of a permanent cure. Relapse (the return of seizures) can occur.\n\n*   **Factors Influencing Relapse Risk:**\n\n    *   **Underlying Cause:** The biggest factor is whether the cause of your initial seizures was ever identified.\n        *   **Idiopathic Epilepsy:** If your epilepsy was considered \"idiopathic\" (meaning the cause was unknown, which is common in childhood epilepsies), there's generally a lower risk of recurrence compared to epilepsy with a known structural or genetic cause. Many children with idiopathic epilepsy outgrow it.\n        *   **Structural or Genetic Causes:** If your seizures were linked to a brain malformation, injury, genetic condition, or other identifiable cause, the risk of recurrence might be higher, even after a long seizure-free period. The underlying issue may still be present.\n    *   **Age of Onset:** Childhood-onset epilepsy sometimes has a better prognosis than epilepsy that starts in adulthood.\n    *   **Seizure Type:** Some seizure types are more likely to go into long-term remission than others.\n    *   **EEG Results:** If you had EEGs (electroencephalograms) during and after treatment, the results can provide insights. Normal EEGs after stopping medication would be a positive sign.\n    *   **Medication Withdrawal:** A carefully managed and gradual withdrawal from medication is crucial. Stopping medication abruptly can significantly increase the risk of seizures returning.\n    *   **Lifestyle Factors:** While not direct causes, certain lifestyle factors can lower your seizure threshold and potentially trigger seizures in someone with a history of epilepsy.\n\n*   **Potential Triggers/Causes of a Return:**\n\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Inconsistent sleep patterns or lack of sleep can be a significant trigger for seizures in many people with epilepsy.\n    *   **Stress:** High levels of stress can also lower the seizure threshold.\n    *   **Alcohol or Drug Use:** Alcohol, especially in excessive amounts, and recreational drugs can trigger seizures.\n    *   **Hormonal Changes:** In women, hormonal fluctuations related to menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can sometimes affect seizure control.\n    *   **Illness/Fever:** Being sick, especially with a high fever, can sometimes trigger seizures.\n    *   **Head Trauma:** A significant head injury could potentially increase the risk of seizures, even years later.\n    *   **Medications:** Certain medications can lower the seizure threshold. Always inform your doctor about your epilepsy history before starting any new medication.\n    *   **Brain Tumors or Lesions:** In rare cases, the development of a new brain tumor or lesion could potentially cause seizures.\n    *   **Stroke:** Very rare at your age, but stroke can cause seizures\n\n*   **What You Should Do:**\n\n    1.  **Consult a Neurologist:** The most important step is to discuss your concerns with a neurologist, preferably one who specializes in epilepsy. They can review your medical history, including your initial diagnosis, EEG results, and medication history.  They can best assess your individual risk and provide personalized advice.  If you don't have a neurologist, ask your primary care doctor for a referral.\n    2.  **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle:**\n        *   **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for consistent and adequate sleep.\n        *   **Manage Stress:** Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature.\n        *   **Avoid Excessive Alcohol and Drug Use:** As mentioned earlier, these can be triggers.\n        *   **Eat a Balanced Diet:** A healthy diet supports overall brain health.\n    3.  **Be Aware of Potential Symptoms:** Pay attention to any unusual sensations, feelings, or behaviors that might precede a seizure (auras).  If you experience any of these, contact your doctor.\n    4.  **Inform Your Doctor About New Medications:** Always tell your doctor about your epilepsy history before starting any new medications.\n    5.  **Consider a Medical ID:** Wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace that indicates you have a history of epilepsy can be helpful in an emergency situation.\n    6.  **Drive Safely:** Obey all driving laws and regulations related to epilepsy.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Panic:** While it's important to be informed, try not to let anxiety overwhelm you. Many people who have been seizure-free for a long time remain seizure-free.\n*   **Focus on Prevention:** Focus on the lifestyle factors you can control, such as getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding alcohol and drugs.\n*   **Early Intervention:** If you do experience a seizure, seek medical attention promptly. Early intervention can often prevent further seizures.\n\nIn summary, while there's no way to guarantee that your epilepsy will never return, understanding the potential risks and taking proactive steps to maintain your health can significantly improve your chances of remaining seizure-free. Consulting with a neurologist is crucial for personalized guidance and management.\n"

    "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is understandably worrying for your sister! Given the recurring nature of these episodes, especially the one with seizure-like activity, it's crucial to seek a more thorough evaluation than just an urgent care visit and a normal EEG done a few days later. While I cannot provide a diagnosis, I can offer possible explanations and suggest further steps.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential causes and why further investigation is important:\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope (Fainting):** This is the most common cause of fainting. It happens when the vagus nerve overreacts to a trigger (like pain, stress, sight of blood, or even standing for a long time), causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. This leads to reduced blood flow to the brain, resulting in a loss of consciousness.\n    *   **Why it's possible:** The descriptions of passing out while eating ice cream *without* seizure activity fit this scenario. Triggers can be unpredictable. The incident of being bumped as a toddler could also be vasovagal.\n    *   **Why it's less likely to explain the recent event:** While vasovagal syncope *can* sometimes be associated with brief muscle jerks, the stiffness and convulsions described sound more like a seizure.\n\n*   **Seizure Disorder (Epilepsy):** Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. While the normal EEG is reassuring, it doesn't entirely rule out epilepsy.\n    *   **Why it's possible:** The stiffness, cessation of breathing, and subsequent convulsions strongly suggest a seizure. Sometimes seizures are brief and followed by a post-ictal state (confusion, drowsiness), which could explain her \"what was that?\" reaction.\n    *   **Why the normal EEG doesn't rule it out:** A single EEG only captures brain activity for a short period. Some types of epilepsy don't show up on a routine EEG, or the EEG may be normal if it's done between seizures.\n    *   **The fact that your niece described falling asleep without trying could indicate a focal seizure (a seizure originating in a specific part of the brain) with impaired awareness** which can feel like sleepiness but is actually an altered state of consciousness.\n\n*   **Cardiac Arrhythmia:** Irregular heart rhythms can sometimes cause fainting due to reduced blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Why it's possible:** Although less likely in a child, a heart problem causing a sudden drop in heart rate or blood pressure could lead to a loss of consciousness.\n    *   **Why further investigation is needed:** Cardiac issues need to be ruled out, especially with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness.\n\n*   **Reflex Anoxic Seizures:** These are caused by a trigger (like pain, fear, or frustration) that causes the heart to slow down or stop briefly. This leads to a loss of consciousness and can be followed by seizure-like activity due to a lack of oxygen to the brain.\n    *   **Why it's possible:** It could be a pain-related trigger, like intense brain freeze causing an anoxic seizure.\n\n*   **Metabolic Issues:** Rare metabolic disorders can sometimes cause seizures or fainting spells, particularly in children.\n\n**Regarding ice cream, sugar, and dairy:**\n\n*   **Ice Cream/Cold Stimulus:** Brain freeze is a real phenomenon, but while it can cause intense pain, it's unlikely to trigger a true seizure directly. The pain *could*, however, trigger a vasovagal response or, less likely, a reflex anoxic seizure in a susceptible individual.\n*   **Sugar:** A sudden drop in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can cause seizures, but it's more likely to occur in individuals with diabetes or other metabolic problems. The timing (while eating ice cream) makes hypoglycemia less likely.\n*   **Dairy Allergy/Intolerance:** While dairy allergies can cause a variety of symptoms, seizures are not a typical symptom.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Pediatric Neurologist:** This is the most important step. A pediatric neurologist specializes in brain and nerve disorders in children and can provide a more thorough evaluation. They will likely:\n    *   Take a detailed medical history, including family history and a description of all episodes.\n    *   Order further testing:\n        *   **Prolonged EEG (Ambulatory EEG):** This involves monitoring brain activity for a longer period (typically 24-72 hours), which increases the chances of capturing an abnormal event.\n        *   **Video EEG:** This combines EEG monitoring with video recording, allowing doctors to see what the child is doing during the seizure activity.\n        *   **MRI of the Brain:** To rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n        *   **EKG/Echocardiogram:** To evaluate heart function.\n    *   Consider other possible causes and order appropriate testing.\n\n2.  **Consult a Pediatric Cardiologist:** If the neurologist suspects a cardiac issue, a referral to a pediatric cardiologist is necessary.\n\n3.  **Keep a Detailed Log:** Help your sister keep a detailed record of any future episodes. Include:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   What the child was doing immediately before\n    *   Detailed description of the event (what you saw, what the child did)\n    *   Duration of the event\n    *   Any post-event symptoms (confusion, drowsiness, headache)\n    *   Dietary intake prior to the event\n\n4.  **Avoid Triggers (If Possible):** While you can't be sure what's triggering these episodes, it might be wise to temporarily avoid giving your niece ice cream until a diagnosis is made.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Safety:** Your sister needs to be prepared in case another episode occurs. Learn basic seizure first aid.\n*   **Advocate:** Be an advocate for your niece and sister. Don't be afraid to ask questions and push for answers.\n\nThe \"interesting\" comment from the doctor isn't helpful. Your niece deserves a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of these events and ensure her safety. Don't delay in seeking a specialist's opinion. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "27 female, I suffer from autism, epilepsy, depressionLymph node on left side of neck is swollen, hearing loss, ears feel blocked, headache and can\u2019t sleep or eat much. I take lamotrigine and clozapam",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand.  You're a 27-year-old female with autism, epilepsy, and depression, and you're experiencing a constellation of new and concerning symptoms: a swollen lymph node on the left side of your neck, hearing loss, a blocked ear sensation, headache, insomnia, and decreased appetite.  You're currently taking lamotrigine and clonazepam.\n\nGiven this combination of symptoms and your medical history, it's essential to seek medical attention promptly. It's impossible for me to provide a diagnosis, and your symptoms could be caused by a number of things.  Here's a breakdown of why and what to do:\n\n**Why This Requires Medical Attention:**\n\n*   **Swollen Lymph Node:** A swollen lymph node can indicate an infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal), inflammation, or, less commonly, a more serious condition. Because you are immune compromised due to the epilepsy and autism it could affect your immune system.\n\n*   **Hearing Loss and Blocked Ears:** This could indicate an ear infection, fluid buildup in the ear, or even something pressing on a nerve.\n\n*   **Headache:** Headaches, especially when combined with other symptoms, need to be evaluated.\n\n*   **Insomnia and Decreased Appetite:** These symptoms can be related to depression, but also to the underlying cause of your other physical symptoms. They can also be side effects of medication.\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** Any new symptoms need to be evaluated in the context of your epilepsy management. Seizures can sometimes manifest in unusual ways.\n\n*   **Medications:** Both Lamotrigine and Clonazepam have potential side effects. It's important to rule out whether your symptoms are related to medication, though it sounds like these are new symptoms, not something you have experienced since the start of the medication.\n\n*   **Autism:** Autism doesn't directly cause these symptoms, but can sometimes present unique challenges in communicating symptoms and experiences.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Doctor Immediately:**  Ideally, call your primary care physician or neurologist (whichever is more familiar with your overall health). Explain all your symptoms clearly. **Emphasize the new onset of hearing loss and the swollen lymph node.**\n2.  **Urgent Care/Emergency Room:** If you can't get in to see your doctor quickly, or if your symptoms worsen rapidly (e.g., severe headache, high fever, significant hearing loss, difficulty breathing), go to an urgent care clinic or the emergency room.\n3.  **Medication List:** Bring a list of all your medications, including dosages, with you to any medical appointment.\n4.  **Prepare to Answer Questions:** Be prepared to answer questions about:\n    *   When your symptoms started\n    *   What makes your symptoms better or worse\n    *   Any recent illnesses or exposures to sick people\n    *   Any recent travel\n    *   Any other medical conditions you have\n\n**Possible Questions the Doctor Might Ask/Tests They Might Run:**\n\n*   Physical Exam: They will examine your ears, nose, throat, and neck, paying close attention to the swollen lymph node.\n*   Hearing Test (Audiometry): To assess the extent and type of hearing loss.\n*   Blood Tests: To check for infection, inflammation, and other potential causes.\n*   Imaging (Possibly): Depending on the initial evaluation, they might order imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI of the head and neck.\n*   Neurological Exam: To assess your neurological function.\n\n**Important Considerations for People with Autism:**\n\n*   **Sensory Sensitivities:** Be aware that medical settings can be overwhelming due to sensory overload.  Consider bringing noise-canceling headphones, a comfort item, or a support person.\n*   **Communication:** If you have difficulty communicating your symptoms, consider writing them down in advance or having a support person help you explain them.\n*   **Advocacy:** Don't hesitate to advocate for your needs and ask for clarification if you don't understand something.\n\n**In summary, your combination of symptoms warrants prompt medical evaluation. Please seek medical attention as soon as possible.**\n"

    "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a complex situation with several potential contributing factors. You've done a good job of laying out the history and your own hypotheses. Let's break down the possibilities and consider some other avenues:\n\n**1. The Vagus Nerve & Hiatal Hernia Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Plausible, but difficult to prove definitively.**  A hiatal hernia can indeed put pressure on the vagus nerve, which plays a significant role in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Weightlifting, especially with the Valsalva maneuver (holding your breath during exertion), can further increase intra-abdominal pressure, potentially exacerbating the pressure on the nerve. This could trigger a vasovagal response, leading to lightheadedness and fainting (syncope).\n*   **Why it might be relevant with pull-ups:** Pull-ups, in particular, involve significant core engagement and often involve straining. This straining increases intra-abdominal pressure more than some other exercises.\n*   **Limitations:** While this makes sense theoretically, it's challenging to measure the precise interaction between the hernia, the vagus nerve, and your response to exercise.\n\n**2. Syncope (Related to Heart Issues):**\n\n*   **Heart tests are good, but not always exhaustive.**  The fact that you went through cardiac testing is reassuring. However, some forms of syncope, such as exertional syncope (fainting during or after exercise), can be challenging to diagnose. Standard tests might not always reveal the underlying issue.\n*   **Consider further cardiac investigation:** If you want to get back to pull-ups, it might be worthwhile to discuss more specialized cardiac testing with your cardiologist.  This could include:\n    *   **Exercise Stress Test with Echocardiogram:**  This assesses heart function under exertion and looks for abnormalities that might not be apparent at rest.\n    *   **Tilt Table Test:** Helps evaluate how your blood pressure and heart rate respond to changes in position, which can be relevant to vasovagal syncope.\n    *   **Holter Monitor:** If the events are infrequent, this can be used to monitor your heart's rhythm for an extended period.\n\n**3. PPIs and Nutrient Absorption:**\n\n*   **PPIs can definitely affect nutrient absorption.** Long-term PPI use can impair the absorption of several nutrients, including:\n    *   **Vitamin B12:** Deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including dizziness, fatigue, and in severe cases, even weakness or altered mental state.\n    *   **Iron:** Deficiency can lead to anemia, causing fatigue, weakness, and lightheadedness.\n    *   **Magnesium:** Deficiency can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and heart rhythm abnormalities.\n    *   **Calcium:** Deficiency can lead to bone weakness and other issues.\n*   **Consider nutrient testing:** It would be wise to have your vitamin B12, iron, magnesium, and calcium levels checked, especially given your long-term PPI use.  Talk to your doctor about appropriate supplementation if deficiencies are found.\n*  **Calcium:** Calcium intake is crucial for muscle contraction and overall health. Discuss this with your doctor and consider calcium supplementation if you are deficient.\n\n**4. Dehydration:**\n\n*   **Could be a contributing factor.** Even mild dehydration can exacerbate lightheadedness and dizziness, especially during and after exercise. Make sure you are adequately hydrated before, during, and after your workouts.\n\n**5. Other Possibilities:**\n\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:** This is a drop in blood pressure when standing up.  It can be more pronounced after exercise.\n*   **Blood Sugar Issues:** While less likely in a healthy, fit individual, it's worth considering if you're experiencing low blood sugar after exercise. This could be addressed by ensuring adequate carbohydrate intake before and after workouts.\n\n**Recommendations & Things to Discuss with Your Doctor:**\n\n1.  **Review Medications & Consider Alternatives to PPIs:** Discuss with your doctor whether there are alternative strategies for managing your GERD, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for PPIs. This might involve lifestyle changes (diet, smaller meals, elevating the head of your bed), or other medications.\n2.  **Targeted Nutrient Testing:** Specifically request testing for vitamin B12, iron, magnesium, and calcium levels. Address any deficiencies with appropriate supplementation under your doctor's guidance.\n3.  **Detailed Exercise & Symptom Log:**  Keep a detailed log of your workouts, including:\n    *   Specific exercises\n    *   Weight used\n    *   Repetitions and sets\n    *   Fluid intake\n    *   Timing of meals\n    *   Any symptoms you experience before, during, or after exercise. This log might help identify patterns or triggers.\n4.  **Cautious Reintroduction of Pull-Ups (Under Medical Supervision):** If you are eager to return to pull-ups, discuss a very cautious and gradual reintroduction plan with your doctor and possibly a physical therapist. This might involve:\n    *   Starting with assisted pull-ups (using a resistance band to reduce the weight)\n    *   Focusing on proper form and breathing\n    *   Monitoring your blood pressure and heart rate closely during and after exercise\n    *   Stopping immediately if you experience any symptoms.\n5.  **Discuss Further Cardiac Evaluation:** Based on your history, and if you plan on going back to pull-ups, explore if further and more specialized heart tests would be beneficial for identifying anything that may have been missed initially.\n6. **Check your blood pressure:** Monitor your blood pressure at various times to see if you have low blood pressure, a condition known as hypotension, especially after exercise.\n\n**In summary, your situation is likely multifactorial. A combination of factors like the hiatal hernia, potential vagal nerve irritation, long-term PPI use and possible nutrient deficiencies, dehydration, and the physiological stress of weightlifting could be contributing to your symptoms.** The key is to work with your healthcare team to investigate these possibilities systematically, address any modifiable risk factors, and develop a safe exercise plan. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "I wanted to share my experience with you to maybe get some more information about my situation.For 10 years, I have been experiencing every couple of months sudden deja vu like feeling followed by dissociation. I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thank you for sharing this with me. It sounds like a distressing and puzzling experience, and it's completely understandable that you're looking for more information and want to understand what might be happening. Let's break this down and explore some possibilities.\n\n**What You're Describing Sounds Like...**\n\nBased on your description, the sudden deja vu feeling followed by dissociation is concerning and potentially points to a few possibilities:\n\n*   **Complex Partial Seizures (Focal Aware Seizures):** Deja vu is a classic symptom of temporal lobe seizures. The fact that it's recurring and followed by dissociation, without loss of consciousness or shaking (like in a grand mal seizure), makes this a real consideration. These seizures are localized to a specific area of the brain (often the temporal lobe) and don't involve widespread electrical activity. They can manifest in various ways, including sensory distortions (like deja vu), emotional changes, and altered awareness (dissociation).\n\n*   **Dissociative Disorder:** Dissociation is a spectrum that can manifest in ways like feeling detached from reality, or feeling like you're observing yourself from the outside. You mention a feeling of dissociation which can potentially be caused by underlying trauma or stress.\n\n*   **Anxiety-Related Symptoms:** While you mention the episodes don't *seem* directly related to stress, anxiety can manifest in unexpected ways. Sometimes, it can be more subtle than an obvious panic attack. Chronic anxiety can dysregulate the nervous system, potentially leading to unusual sensory experiences and feelings of unreality. Although less likely, the deja vu could be triggered by subconscious anxiety even if you are unaware of it.\n\n**Why It's Important to Investigate Further**\n\nIt's crucial to get this investigated properly because:\n\n*   **Seizures Need Diagnosis and Management:** If the deja vu and dissociation are indeed caused by seizures, it's important to identify the type of seizure and determine the underlying cause. Anti-seizure medication can often effectively control or eliminate these seizures, improving your quality of life.\n\n*   **Ruling Out Other Medical Causes:** In rare cases, other medical conditions can cause similar symptoms. Getting a proper diagnosis can rule out these possibilities.\n\n*   **Addressing Anxiety Effectively:** Even if anxiety is the primary driver, understanding the specific mechanisms at play will allow you and your therapist or psychiatrist to tailor your treatment plan for maximum effectiveness.\n\n**What You Should Do**\n\nGiven the recurring nature and the potential link to seizures, here\u2019s my recommendation:\n\n1.  **Consult a Neurologist:** The *most* important step is to see a neurologist as soon as possible. Explain your symptoms in detail, including the frequency, duration, and specific sensations you experience.\n\n2.  **Mention Anxiety History:** Be open with the neurologist about your history of generalized anxiety disorder. This information helps them develop a comprehensive picture of your health.\n\n3.  **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** An EEG is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity in your brain. It can help detect abnormal brainwave patterns that may indicate seizure activity. Ideally, if possible, an EEG should be done while you are experiencing one of your events.\n\n4.  **MRI of the Brain:** The neurologist may also order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, such as tumors, lesions, or other conditions that could be causing the symptoms.\n\n5.  **Keep a Detailed Log:** Start keeping a log of your episodes. Note the date, time, duration, specific sensations (describe the deja vu and dissociation as precisely as possible), any potential triggers you can identify, and what you were doing immediately before and after the episode. This log will be invaluable to your neurologist.\n\n6.  **Consider a Therapist or Psychiatrist (if you aren't already):** If anxiety is playing a role, ongoing therapy and/or medication management can be extremely helpful. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based techniques are often effective for managing anxiety.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's tempting to try to figure this out on your own, but it's essential to get a professional medical opinion. Internet research can be helpful for learning more, but it shouldn't replace the expertise of a qualified healthcare provider.\n\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Be persistent with your doctors. If you feel like your concerns aren't being adequately addressed, seek a second opinion. Your health and well-being are paramount.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Remember, I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. It's essential to consult with qualified healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment. Good luck, and I hope you find answers and relief soon.\n"

    "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",

    "answer": "This is a very compelling and concerning situation. The immediate cessation of symptoms across all three of you (two humans, one cat) upon moving points strongly to an environmental factor within the old basement suite. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and what you should consider doing:\n\n**Likely Culprits (Environmental Factors):**\n\n*   **Mold:** Basement suites are notorious for mold growth due to humidity and poor ventilation. Black mold (Stachybotrys) and other types of mold can produce mycotoxins that cause a range of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue, and respiratory problems. This is a very likely candidate, especially given the long-term nature of the issue and the basement location.\n\n*   **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** Though less likely because CO poisoning often involves other symptoms like headaches and dizziness, a malfunctioning appliance (furnace, water heater) could have been leaking low levels of CO. CO poisoning can also cause nausea and vomiting. CO detectors are essential, but sometimes levels can fluctuate and not trigger the alarm.\n\n*   **Radon:** Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that seeps from the ground. Basements are particularly vulnerable. Long-term exposure to radon is a leading cause of lung cancer, but short-term exposure can cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n*   **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** VOCs are emitted from a variety of household products, including paints, cleaning supplies, adhesives, and new furniture. Poor ventilation in a basement can trap these VOCs and lead to health problems.\n\n*   **Pesticides/Rodenticides:** If the landlord used pesticides or rodenticides in or around the basement suite, these could be a source of toxicity.\n\n*   **Sewer Gas:** A leak in the sewer line could release gases like hydrogen sulfide, which can cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n**Less Likely, But Still Possible:**\n\n*   **Water Contamination:** If you were all using the same water source (drinking, showering), contamination could be a factor. However, this is less likely since it stopped so abruptly upon moving.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Fields (EMF):** Some people are sensitive to EMFs emitted from electrical wiring or appliances, but it's less likely to cause such specific symptoms in multiple individuals.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n1.  **Contact the Landlord/Property Owner IMMEDIATELY:** This is the most crucial step. Inform them of the situation and your suspicion of an environmental hazard. They need to investigate and address the issue to protect future tenants.\n\n2.  **Inform the Current/Future Tenants:** Since the house is for sale, any future tenants or owners could be affected by the same issues.\n\n3.  **Professional Environmental Testing:** Strongly recommend the landlord have the property tested for mold, radon, carbon monoxide, and VOCs by a qualified environmental testing company. This is the only way to definitively identify the cause.\n\n4.  **Medical Records Review:** While the environmental factor seems highly likely, review your medical records and your husband's with your doctors. It's worth ruling out any other potential underlying conditions, even though the timing strongly suggests the house was the problem.\n\n5.  **Report to Local Health Authorities:** You may want to contact your local health department or housing authority to report the situation. They may be able to provide guidance and ensure the property owner takes appropriate action.\n\n6.  **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of everything: symptoms, dates, conversations with the landlord, test results, and medical appointments.\n\n**Regarding Your Cat:** Animals are often more sensitive to environmental toxins than humans, so the cat's symptoms are a significant indicator that something was amiss.\n\n**Crucially Important:** Do NOT return to the basement suite to retrieve belongings without first ensuring the environment has been professionally tested and remediated if necessary. Your health and safety are paramount.\n\nThe fact that all three of you experienced the same symptoms, which then immediately resolved upon moving, is strong evidence of a serious environmental problem in that basement suite. Taking swift action is essential to protect yourselves and others who may be exposed.\n"

    "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these symptoms, especially given the combination of substances you used and the subsequent onset of twitching and \"brain zaps.\" While I can't diagnose you, I can offer some insights and guidance on what might be happening and what your next steps should be.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of potential causes and what to consider:**\n\n*   **SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome (SSRI Withdrawal):**\n    *   This is the most likely explanation for the \"brain zaps.\" These sensations are a hallmark of SSRI withdrawal and are caused by the brain readjusting to the absence of the medication.\n    *   The fact that you stopped taking fluoxetine suddenly after only a short period increases the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms.\n    *   Withdrawal symptoms can include:\n        *   Brain zaps\n        *   Dizziness\n        *   Flu-like symptoms\n        *   Anxiety\n        *   Insomnia\n        *   Mood changes\n        *   Sensory disturbances (like the twitching)\n\n*   **Serotonin Syndrome:**\n    *   Serotonin syndrome is a potentially serious condition that can occur when there is too much serotonin in the brain. It's more likely when combining multiple substances that affect serotonin levels.\n    *   Fluoxetine is an SSRI, which increases serotonin. Kratom and THC can also affect serotonin levels, especially in combination with alcohol.\n    *   While you may have experienced mild serotonin syndrome, the fact that the symptoms have persisted for two months makes it less likely that it's the primary cause. Serotonin syndrome typically resolves within 24-72 hours after discontinuing the causative agents.\n    *   Symptoms of serotonin syndrome can include:\n        *   Agitation\n        *   Confusion\n        *   Increased heart rate\n        *   Dilated pupils\n        *   Muscle rigidity\n        *   Twitching\n        *   Sweating\n        *   Diarrhea\n\n*   **Substance-Induced Neurological Changes:**\n    *   While less probable than SSRI withdrawal, the combination of alcohol, kratom, and THC could have triggered or exacerbated underlying neurological vulnerabilities. Kratom, in particular, can have stimulant and opioid-like effects and could potentially contribute to neurological disturbances.\n    *   Alcohol withdrawal can also cause neurological symptoms, although the timing doesn't perfectly align with your drinking episode.\n\n*   **New-Onset Epilepsy:**\n    *   While less likely, it's important to consider the possibility, especially since you describe the twitching as \"myoclonus,\" which can be a type of seizure.\n    *   It's unlikely that a single episode of substance use would cause epilepsy. However, if you have an underlying predisposition to seizures, the substances could have acted as a trigger.\n    *   *Loss of focus* with the twitching can be concerning as well. Seizures can be *focal*, meaning they start in one area of the brain. It's possible the twitching is coming from a focal area of your brain and impairing your focus.\n\n**Why it's crucial to see a doctor:**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Only a doctor can determine the exact cause of your symptoms. They can rule out other potential medical conditions and determine if you need further testing, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check for seizure activity.\n*   **Treatment:** While there may not be a \"cure\" for SSRI withdrawal or twitching, a doctor can help manage your symptoms and prevent complications.\n*   **Rule Out Serious Conditions:** Although it's likely that your symptoms are related to SSRI withdrawal or the substances you used, it's important to rule out other potential causes, such as electrolyte imbalances, neurological disorders, or infections.\n*   **Epilepsy:** Even though it's probably not epilepsy, it's important to determine whether you have epilepsy so you can prevent complications with future drug use or other lifestyle choices.\n\n**What you should do NOW:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Doctor's Appointment:** Despite the potential wait time, it's crucial to establish care with a general practitioner (GP) as soon as possible. Even a telehealth appointment could be a good starting point. In the meantime, you might be able to get a referral from a walk-in clinic. Make sure you give a full, honest history. It's important that your doctor knows about the substances you used, even though it may be embarrassing. They need to know everything to make an informed decision about your care.\n2.  **Be Detailed with Your Doctor:** When you see a doctor, be prepared to provide a detailed history of your symptoms, including:\n    *   When the symptoms started\n    *   What makes them better or worse\n    *   How often they occur\n    *   What you were doing when they started\n    *   All the substances you used, including the amounts and timing\n3.  **Avoid Substances:** Abstain from alcohol, kratom, THC, and other recreational drugs until you've been evaluated by a doctor. These substances could be exacerbating your symptoms or interfering with your body's ability to heal.\n4.  **Consider Tapering if You Restart Fluoxetine:** If your doctor determines that SSRI withdrawal is the primary cause of your symptoms, they may recommend restarting fluoxetine at a low dose and then gradually tapering off. *Do not do this without medical supervision.*\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **\"Mild, localized seizures\" are still something to take seriously.** Even if the twitching seems minor, it's important to get it checked out. The location in the brain that generates the seizures can lead to other problems.\n*   **Self-treating is risky.** It's understandable that you want to find a solution on your own, but it's important to seek professional medical advice for your symptoms.\n*   **Honesty is key.** Be honest with your doctor about your substance use so they can provide the best possible care. They are there to help you, not judge you.\n\n**In summary,** while it's likely that your symptoms are related to SSRI withdrawal, it's important to rule out other potential causes, including new-onset epilepsy. Schedule a doctor's appointment as soon as possible, be honest about your substance use, and follow their recommendations.\n"

    "question": "My little sister, age 12, was diagnosed with epilepsy for the last 1 year. She has been taking necessary medications for its cure and prevention. However, she has been ill for the last few days and we ran a few tests waiting to get reports tomorrow. It's 3am now and she has been acting and moving her body weirdly while sleeping for the last hour, we're suspecting she's having nocturnal epilepsy. Moreover, she has been telling us she feels tremor in her stomach for the past 3 days. It would be really nice if anyone could answer the following questions    What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?    What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're worried about your sister. Dealing with epilepsy, especially when it seems to be changing or worsening, is incredibly stressful.  It's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not substitute for consulting with a qualified healthcare professional.\n\nGiven the changes in her behavior and the potential for nocturnal seizures, it's crucial to consult with her neurologist or epilepsy specialist as soon as possible. Explain all the symptoms you've observed, including the \"tremors\" in her stomach. These details are critical for proper diagnosis and management.\n\nHere's some general information regarding your questions, but remember, personalized advice from her doctor is essential:\n\n**1. General Causes of Epilepsy:**\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures.  The causes are varied and sometimes unknown. Here are some potential factors:\n\n*   **Genetic Factors:**  Some types of epilepsy have a strong genetic component. If there's a family history of seizures, it could increase the risk.\n*   **Brain Injury:** Trauma to the head (even seemingly minor ones), stroke, brain tumors, or infections like meningitis can damage the brain and lead to epilepsy.\n*   **Developmental Problems:**  Problems during brain development in the womb can sometimes result in epilepsy.\n*   **Metabolic Disorders:**  Rare metabolic disorders can disrupt brain function and trigger seizures.\n*   **Unknown Cause (Idiopathic Epilepsy):**  In many cases, the specific cause of epilepsy cannot be identified, even with extensive testing. This is called idiopathic epilepsy.\n\nThe \"tremor\" in the stomach could be related to abdominal epilepsy (a rare form where seizures originate in the abdominal area), medication side effects, anxiety, or a completely unrelated medical issue. It's important for her doctor to evaluate this symptom thoroughly.\n\n**2. Precautions for Speedy Cure/Prevention (Management):**\n\n*   **Strict Medication Adherence:**  The most critical thing is to follow the doctor's prescribed medication regimen *exactly*.  Do not change the dosage or stop the medication without consulting the doctor, even if she feels better.  Missed doses are a major trigger for seizures.\n*   **Regular Doctor Visits:**  Attend all scheduled appointments with the neurologist or epilepsy specialist.  Regular check-ups allow the doctor to monitor her progress, adjust medication as needed, and address any concerns.\n*   **Identify and Avoid Triggers (if possible):**  Some people with epilepsy have specific triggers that can provoke seizures. Common triggers include:\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:**  Ensure she gets adequate and regular sleep.  A consistent sleep schedule is very important.\n    *   **Stress:**  Help her manage stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, or counseling if needed.\n    *   **Flickering Lights:**  For some people, flashing lights can trigger seizures.  Avoid environments with rapidly flickering lights.\n    *   **Alcohol and Drug Use:**  Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs, as they can interfere with medication and increase the risk of seizures.\n    *   **Specific Foods (Rare):** In rare cases, certain foods might be triggers. Keep a food diary and note any correlation with seizure activity.\n*   **Healthy Lifestyle:**\n    *   **Balanced Diet:**  A healthy diet is essential for overall well-being.\n    *   **Regular Exercise:**  Physical activity can help manage stress and improve sleep.  However, discuss appropriate exercise with her doctor, as some activities might pose a risk if a seizure occurs.\n*   **Education:**  Learn as much as you can about your sister's specific type of epilepsy, her medications, and seizure first aid.  Knowledge empowers you to provide better support.\n\n**3. What to Do During a Nocturnal Seizure:**\n\n*   **Stay Calm:**  Your calm demeanor will help you think clearly and provide the best support.\n*   **Protect Her from Injury:**\n    *   **Clear the Area:** Remove any sharp or hard objects from the immediate vicinity to prevent her from bumping into them.\n    *   **Cushion Her Head:** If possible, gently place a soft pillow or cushion under her head.\n    *   **Do NOT Restrain Her:**  Do not try to hold her down or stop her movements.  This can cause injury.\n*   **Loosen Tight Clothing:** If her clothing is tight around her neck, loosen it to help with breathing.\n*   **Turn Her on Her Side (if possible and safe):**  This helps prevent her from choking on saliva or vomit.  Gently roll her onto her side after the seizure has started to subside.\n*   **Observe and Time the Seizure:**  Note how long the seizure lasts and what happens during it. This information is important for the doctor.\n*   **Do NOT Put Anything in Her Mouth:**  This is an outdated and dangerous practice.  It can cause injury to her teeth or jaw.  She will not swallow her tongue.\n*   **Stay with Her Until She Fully Recovers:**  After the seizure, she may be confused or disoriented.  Speak to her calmly and reassuringly.\n*   **Call for Emergency Medical Assistance (911 or your local emergency number) if:**\n    *   The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.\n    *   She has repeated seizures without regaining consciousness in between.\n    *   She is injured during the seizure.\n    *   She has difficulty breathing after the seizure.\n    *   This is her first seizure.\n    *   You are unsure about what to do.\n*   **Consider a Seizure Monitor:**  There are devices that can detect unusual movements during sleep and alert you to a potential seizure.  Discuss this option with her doctor.\n*   **Seizure Action Plan:**  Develop a written seizure action plan with her doctor and share it with family members, caregivers, and school personnel.\n\n**4. Habits to Change to Reduce Injury Risk:**\n\n*   **Bathing/Swimming:**  Never leave her unattended in the bath or swimming pool.  Consider showering instead of bathing.  If swimming, ensure a responsible adult is always present and aware of her epilepsy.\n*   **Cooking:**  Supervise her closely when she is cooking.  Use caution with hot stoves, ovens, and sharp objects.\n*   **Heights:**  Avoid activities that involve heights, such as climbing ladders or being on balconies without supervision.\n*   **Driving/Operating Machinery:**  Driving is typically restricted for people with epilepsy until they have been seizure-free for a certain period of time (determined by local laws and the doctor's recommendation). Operating heavy machinery is also generally discouraged.\n*   **Protective Gear:**  Wear a helmet during activities like cycling, skateboarding, or skiing.\n*   **Inform Others:**  Make sure that family members, friends, teachers, and other caregivers are aware of her epilepsy and know what to do if she has a seizure.\n*   **Medical Alert Bracelet/Necklace:**  Consider having her wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that identifies her as having epilepsy and lists her medications.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Make sure all doctors (including dentists) are aware of her epilepsy and the medications she is taking to avoid potential drug interactions.\n*   **Mental Health:** Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with anxiety and depression.  Monitor her mood and seek professional help if needed.\n*   **School/Work:** Work with her school to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that accommodates her needs.  This may include allowing extra time for tests, having a designated person trained in seizure first aid, and ensuring a safe environment.\n*   **Support Groups:** Connecting with other families who have children with epilepsy can provide valuable support and information.\n\n**Regarding the Test Results:**\n\nThe test results you are waiting for will likely provide valuable information to her doctor. These tests may include:\n\n*   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):**  This test measures brain activity and can help identify seizure activity.\n*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**  This scan can help detect structural abnormalities in the brain that might be causing seizures.\n*   **Blood Tests:**  Blood tests can help rule out other medical conditions that could be contributing to seizures and monitor medication levels.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nYour sister's well-being is the top priority. The best course of action is to consult with her neurologist or epilepsy specialist *immediately*. Explain all of her symptoms and your concerns. The doctor can provide personalized guidance based on her specific situation. Remember to stay calm, be supportive, and advocate for her needs.\n"

    "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation and it's important to proceed carefully. Let's break down your concerns and explore possible explanations and next steps.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n*   **AVM Removal and Epilepsy:** The AVM surgery is a significant factor. Damage to the brain during surgery, even when successfully removing the AVM, can have lasting effects. The location of the AVM on the right side of your brain is crucial because the right hemisphere primarily controls the *left* side of the body. Your epilepsy is also important to keep in mind, as seizures can sometimes worsen neurological deficits or complicate the diagnostic picture.\n*   **Specific Weakness in Left Shoulder and Arm:** The consistent weakness and \"falling over\" of your left shoulder and arm during specific exercises like shoulder presses and dumbbell curls strongly suggest a localized motor control problem. The fact that it's triggered by exertion and doesn't significantly impede daily tasks points to a subtle deficit that's only revealed under stress.\n*   **Uneven Arms and Shoulders:** This asymmetry is a key observation. It supports the idea of a potential weakness or imbalance that has developed over time.\n*   **Neurologist's Assessment:** Your neurologist's assessment that the weakness is due to the brain surgery is plausible. However, it's important to explore *how* the surgery might have caused this specific presentation.\n*   **Hemiparesis:** Your self-research into hemiparesis is relevant. Hemiparesis *could* be a potential explanation, even if mild. The key is to determine if the pattern of weakness fits this diagnosis. Hemiparesis is weakness on one side of the body, and while often associated with stroke, it can result from any brain injury affecting motor pathways.\n\n**Why Hemiparesis is a Reasonable Consideration (and why you should discuss it further with your doctor):**\n\n*   **Location of AVM:** The right-sided AVM and subsequent surgery aligns with the potential for left-sided weakness.\n*   **Specific Pattern of Weakness:** The fact that the weakness is most pronounced with specific movements (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion) is consistent with a motor pathway problem.\n*   **Asymmetry:** The uneven arms and shoulders suggest a chronic imbalance, which can be a result of one side compensating.\n*   **Subtlety:** Hemiparesis doesn't always present as complete paralysis. Mild hemiparesis (sometimes called \"subtle hemiparesis\") can manifest as weakness, clumsiness, or decreased coordination, particularly with more demanding tasks.\n\n**Why Your Doctor Might Not Have Emphasized Hemiparesis (but why you should still ask for clarity):**\n\n*   **Severity:** If the weakness is relatively mild and doesn't significantly impair daily living, it may not have been considered clinically significant enough for a formal diagnosis.\n*   **Focus on Epilepsy:** Your neurologist may be prioritizing seizure management, and the motor weakness might be seen as a stable, less pressing issue.\n*   **Implicit Assumption:** The neurologist might have assumed that this weakness was already addressed and accepted as a consequence of the surgery.\n\n**Actionable Steps:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Follow-Up Appointment with Your Neurologist:**\n    *   **Specifically Ask About Hemiparesis:** Explain that you've been researching your symptoms and are curious if hemiparesis could be a contributing factor.\n    *   **Be Specific About Your Lifting Difficulties:** Describe in detail the exercises you've tried, the specific movements that cause the weakness, and the impact on your ability to lift.\n    *   **Inquire About Further Evaluation:** Ask if further neurological testing would be helpful. This could include:\n        *   **Repeat Neurological Exam:** A more detailed assessment of your motor strength, reflexes, and coordination.\n        *   **EMG/Nerve Conduction Studies:** To rule out any peripheral nerve problems in your left arm or shoulder.\n        *   **Repeat Brain MRI:** To assess for any changes in the brain since your surgery or any new areas of concern.\n\n2.  **Consider a Referral to a Physiatrist (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Physician):**\n    *   A physiatrist specializes in the rehabilitation of neurological and musculoskeletal conditions. They can:\n        *   Perform a comprehensive assessment of your motor function.\n        *   Develop a targeted exercise program to address your specific weaknesses and imbalances.\n        *   Prescribe assistive devices if needed (though this is less likely given the nature of your issue).\n\n3.  **Consult with a Physical Therapist:**\n    *   A physical therapist experienced in neurological rehabilitation can:\n        *   Evaluate your movement patterns and identify specific muscle weaknesses.\n        *   Design a personalized exercise program to strengthen your weak muscles, improve your coordination, and address any compensatory movements.\n        *   Teach you proper lifting techniques to minimize stress on your shoulder and arm.\n\n4.  **Approach Weightlifting with a Modified Plan (While Awaiting Further Evaluation):**\n    *   **Focus on Correct Form:** Prioritize perfect form over heavy weight. Use a mirror to monitor your posture and movement patterns.\n    *   **Start with Very Light Weights or No Weights:** Begin with bodyweight exercises or very light dumbbells to build a foundation of strength and stability.\n    *   **Isolate Specific Muscles:** Use exercises that isolate the muscles around your shoulder and arm, such as rotator cuff exercises (external rotations, internal rotations), scapular retractions, and tricep extensions.\n    *   **Consider Resistance Bands:** Resistance bands provide a progressive way to build strength and can be less stressful on your joints than dumbbells.\n    *   **Avoid Exercises That Aggravate Your Weakness:** If an exercise consistently causes your arm to \"fall over\" or tremble, avoid it for now and focus on other exercises.\n    *   **Listen to Your Body:** Stop immediately if you feel any pain.\n    *   **Increase Slowly:** Gradually increase the weight, resistance, or repetitions as you get stronger.\n    *   **Consider Alternative Exercises:** If you find that certain exercises are too difficult, try modifying them or finding alternative exercises that target the same muscles.\n        *   **For shoulder press**: Try seated dumbbell shoulder press, as this provides a more stable base of support.\n        *   **For dumbbell curl:** Try concentration curls, as this provides more stability.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Patience:** Improving strength and motor control after a brain injury takes time and consistent effort.\n*   **Realistic Expectations:** You may not be able to achieve the same level of strength or function as someone without a history of brain surgery. However, with appropriate rehabilitation, you can likely improve your strength, coordination, and ability to participate in weightlifting activities.\n\n**In summary, you need to advocate for yourself and actively participate in the diagnostic and treatment process. By clearly communicating your concerns, asking specific questions, and seeking the expertise of the appropriate healthcare professionals, you can work towards addressing your weakness and maximizing your physical potential.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

    "question": "I\u2019m a 22 year old female and I have quite a track sheet of medical issues. I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m not sure if they are related and I really don\u2019t know which road to go down.I\u2019ve had ruptured ovarian cysts consistently since I was 12. every time I ovulate. I\u2019ve been on birth control since I was 13 because of that. I have insanely painful periods and I know my hormones are out of wack but I\u2019ve never been diagnosed officially with PCOS or endometriosis but I think I could have either one. not sure.I got diagnosed with epilepsy last February after two grand mal seizures on the same day. coincidentally(?) I had just gotten off birth control to try and heal my body naturally. my seizures seem to align with my menstrual cycle. I\u2019m on Keppra and it\u2019s controlling my tonic clonic seizures but I have breakthrough absence seizures 3x a week. originally my first EEG only showed right temporal lobe seizures but my most recent EEG showed right and left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe seizures.while I was in the epilepsy monitoring unit last week for a 7 day EEG during a pretty intense grand mal seizure my heart rate hit 275 bpm. I\u2019ve always felt little heart flutters but this was intense. I have a Holter monitor now, and I was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. I\u2019m getting an ablation next week. the flutters happen after every seizure but sometimes just on their own without seizure activity.can someone please help me connect the dots, or point me in the direction of someone who can help? I\u2019m really up for any suggestions right now because I want to go back to my normal life. thank you!",

    "answer": "Okay, this is a lot to unpack, and you're right to feel overwhelmed. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex interplay of hormonal, neurological, and cardiovascular issues. While I am an AI and can't provide medical diagnoses, I can definitely help you think about how these issues might be connected and suggest avenues for investigation with your doctors.  It's crucial to communicate all of this to your healthcare team.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential connections and some suggested steps:\n\n**1. The Hormonal Component (Ovarian Cysts, Painful Periods, Suspected PCOS/Endometriosis):**\n\n*   **Connection to Seizures:** Hormonal fluctuations, particularly estrogen, can influence seizure threshold. Estrogen can be excitatory in the brain, making seizures more likely.  Progesterone, on the other hand, can be protective.  The fact that your seizures seem to align with your menstrual cycle strongly suggests a hormonal link.  Coming off birth control likely exacerbated this issue as your natural hormone cycles became more prominent.\n*   **PCOS and Epilepsy:**  There's emerging research exploring a potential link between PCOS and epilepsy. While the exact mechanisms aren't fully understood, insulin resistance (common in PCOS) and hormonal imbalances are thought to play a role.\n*   **Endometriosis and Epilepsy:** Endometriosis, while primarily affecting the pelvic region, can cause systemic inflammation. While a direct link to epilepsy isn't well-established, chronic inflammation can potentially affect neurological function.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **See an Endocrinologist:** A thorough evaluation for PCOS and/or endometriosis is crucial. This should include blood work to assess hormone levels (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, LH, FSH, prolactin), as well as potentially an ultrasound or MRI.\n    *   **Discuss Hormonal Management with your Neurologist and Gynaecologist:**  Even if you don't have a formal diagnosis of PCOS or endometriosis, you and your neurologist and gynaecologist need to collaborate on a plan to manage your hormonal fluctuations in relation to your seizure control. This might involve:\n        *   **Restarting Hormonal Birth Control:**  If birth control helped stabilize your seizures, it might be a necessary tool, even if you'd prefer not to be on it.  Discuss different types of birth control with varying hormone profiles to see what works best. Progesterone-only options may be more beneficial.\n        *   **Hormone Level Monitoring:** Closely monitoring your hormone levels throughout your cycle can help identify patterns that trigger seizures.\n        *   **Other Hormonal Therapies:**  In some cases, other hormonal therapies like GnRH agonists (for endometriosis) might be considered, but this would need careful evaluation by a specialist.\n\n**2. The Neurological Component (Epilepsy):**\n\n*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:** Temporal lobe epilepsy is often associated with complex partial seizures (which can include absence seizures) and can sometimes affect the autonomic nervous system (which controls heart rate, blood pressure, etc.). The spread of seizure activity to the frontal lobe is significant and needs to be addressed with your neurologist.\n*   **Seizure-Induced Arrhythmias:**  Seizures can trigger changes in heart rate and rhythm due to the autonomic nervous system activation during a seizure. It's not uncommon for heart rate to increase dramatically during a seizure. The fact that you're experiencing SVT independently of seizures suggests that you have an underlying heart condition and that the seizure triggered a particularly severe episode.\n*   **Keppra and Breakthrough Seizures:**  Keppra is a common anti-seizure medication, but it doesn't work for everyone. The fact that you're still having absence seizures 3 times a week indicates that your current dose may not be sufficient, or that Keppra may not be the right medication for you.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **Regular Follow-Up with Your Neurologist:**  This is paramount.  Discuss the breakthrough seizures, the EEG findings, and the relationship between your seizures and your menstrual cycle.\n    *   **Medication Adjustment:** Your neurologist may need to adjust your Keppra dosage or consider adding a second anti-seizure medication to address the breakthrough absence seizures.\n    *   **Further Epilepsy Testing:**  Consider asking about more advanced epilepsy testing, such as:\n        *   **High-Resolution MRI:** To look for subtle structural abnormalities in the brain that might be contributing to your seizures.\n        *   **SPECT Scan (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography):** Can help pinpoint areas of abnormal brain activity during or after a seizure.\n        *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** To assess cognitive function and identify any areas affected by seizures.\n\n**3. The Cardiovascular Component (SVT):**\n\n*   **Connection to Seizures:**  As mentioned earlier, seizures can affect the autonomic nervous system, which regulates heart rate.  The high heart rate during your grand mal seizure is likely due to this autonomic activation. The fact that you're experiencing flutters independent of seizures suggests an underlying cardiac condition.\n*   **Connection to Hormones:**  Hormones can also influence heart rhythm. Estrogen, in particular, has been linked to an increased risk of arrhythmias in some individuals.\n*   **Ablation:**  An ablation is a good step for treating SVT. However, it's important to understand *why* you developed SVT.\n*   **Recommendations:**\n    *   **Follow-Up with Your Cardiologist:**  After the ablation, continue to follow up with your cardiologist.  Discuss whether further cardiac testing is needed to rule out other underlying heart conditions.\n    *   **Medication Review:**  Make sure your cardiologist and neurologist are aware of all medications you're taking, as some medications can affect heart rhythm.\n\n**General Recommendations & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Keep a Detailed Journal:**  Document your periods, seizure frequency and type, heart palpitations, medication changes, stress levels, diet, and sleep. This will be invaluable information for your doctors.\n2.  **Find a Multidisciplinary Team:**  Ideally, you'd have a neurologist, endocrinologist/gynecologist, and cardiologist who are willing to communicate and collaborate on your case.  A headache specialist could also be useful, given the hormonal component.\n3.  **Consider an Epilepsy Center:** Epilepsy centers specialize in complex cases and have the resources to offer advanced diagnostic testing and treatment options.\n4.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't be afraid to ask questions, express your concerns, and seek second opinions if you're not satisfied with the care you're receiving. You know your body best!\n5.  **Genetic Testing:** Consider genetic testing for epilepsy or other genetic syndromes that may be related to all of your conditions. This will help narrow the search for answers.\n\n**Possible Underlying Conditions to Explore:**\n\n*   **Catamenial Epilepsy:** Epilepsy that is specifically linked to the menstrual cycle.\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction/Dysautonomia:** A broader term for problems with the autonomic nervous system that could contribute to both the heart rhythm issues and potentially even the seizures.\n*   **Mitochondrial Disorders:** Rare genetic disorders that can affect multiple organ systems, including the brain and heart.\n\nThis is a challenging situation, but with a thorough evaluation and coordinated care from a multidisciplinary team, you can hopefully find answers and improve your quality of life. Don't give up! Good luck!\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down this situation with your symptoms and the possible mild cerebral hypoxia finding. It's important to state upfront that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not substitute a consultation with qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n**Understanding Cerebral Hypoxia**\n\nCerebral hypoxia means your brain isn't getting enough oxygen. The severity of the lack of oxygen determines the extent of the brain's injury:\n\n*   **Severe Hypoxia:** This can cause significant brain damage, leading to coma, permanent disability, or death.\n*   **Moderate Hypoxia:** This can cause cognitive impairment, seizures, motor problems, and other neurological issues.\n*   **Mild Hypoxia:** As you've noted, information is scarce. Mild hypoxia *can* be subtle, but it's not necessarily benign. Even mild, repeated episodes could potentially have cumulative effects over time.\n\n**Key Concerns and Questions Based on Your Information**\n\n1.  **Frequency and Duration:** The fact that you're experiencing these \"episodes\" (spasms, staring) multiple times a day *is* concerning. Frequency matters. Even if each episode is mild, the repeated oxygen deprivation could, theoretically, contribute to long-term problems. We need to know the reason why they are happening, and if these episodes are causing damage or long-term effects.\n\n2.  **Underlying Cause:** Mild cerebral hypoxia isn't a diagnosis in itself; it's a symptom. The crucial question is: *What is causing it?*  The ambulatory EEG suggested it, so now you need to find out why.\n    *   **Cardiac Issues:** This is why the cardiology referral is essential. Heart problems (e.g., arrhythmias, structural defects, heart failure) can reduce blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Respiratory Issues:** Although less likely given your age and relative health, respiratory problems (e.g., sleep apnea, asthma) could be a contributing factor.\n    *   **Vascular Issues:** Problems with the blood vessels leading to the brain (e.g., narrowing, clots) could also be responsible.\n    *   **Diabetes-Related Issues:** While your recent blood tests were normal, fluctuations in blood sugar, especially hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. It's also important to note that long-term diabetes can affect blood vessels.\n    *   **Medications:** If you are taking any medications at all, review these with your medical professionals, as these may be responsible for some of the issues.\n\n3.  **Nature of the \"Episodes\":** Your description of spasms and staring is vague. Do you lose consciousness? Are you aware of your surroundings during these episodes?  Do you have any memory of the events?  These details are important for your doctors to understand.\n\n4.  **EEG Interpretation:** It's important to get clarification on the EEG results. The EEG technician and doctor who reviewed it should explain:\n    *   Specifically *what* \"slowing\" of the brain waves means in your case.\n    *   How confident they are in the cerebral hypoxia diagnosis based on the EEG.\n    *   If the EEG showed any other abnormalities.\n\n**Steps to Take While Waiting for Cardiology Appointment**\n\n1.  **Detailed Symptom Log:** Keep a very detailed log of your \"episodes.\" Include:\n    *   Time of day\n    *   What you were doing immediately beforehand (e.g., sitting, standing, eating, etc.)\n    *   Specific description of the symptoms (spasms where, what type of staring, any other sensations)\n    *   Duration of the episode\n    *   Any triggers you notice (e.g., stress, certain foods, lack of sleep)\n    *   Blood sugar level at the time (if possible and safe to check)\n\n2.  **Contact Your Primary Care Physician (PCP) or Endocrinologist:** Let them know the results of the ambulatory EEG and the referral to cardiology.  Ask if they have any recommendations or can expedite the cardiology appointment.\n\n3.  **Rule Out Other Potential Causes:** Work with your primary doctor to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as:\n    *   **Migraine variants:** Some types of migraine can cause unusual neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Anxiety/Panic Attacks:** These can sometimes manifest with physical symptoms.\n    *   **Other neurological conditions:** While the EEG ruled out epilepsy, there are other less common neurological conditions to consider.\n\n4.  **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Optimize Blood Sugar Control:** Work closely with your endocrinologist to ensure your blood sugar levels are well-managed.\n    *   **Regular Exercise:** Maintain your relatively good shape through regular exercise, but avoid overexertion.\n    *   **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.\n    *   **Ergonomics:** Improve your posture and workstation setup to minimize strain, especially when looking at a screen. Take frequent breaks to stand up and move around.\n    *   **Avoid Alcohol and Smoking:** These can worsen hypoxia.\n\n5.  **Review Medications:** Double check all medications to ensure these are not responsible for your symptoms.\n\n**In summary:** Your symptoms and the EEG finding warrant further investigation. The cardiology appointment is important, but don't passively wait. Be proactive in gathering information, tracking your symptoms, and communicating with your healthcare team. This will help ensure you receive the best possible care.\n"

    "question": "Currently on no medications, BW is normal other than some minor indication of anemia and malnourishment (low folate, hemotacrit, hemoglobin, vitamin d, sodium) high albumin.Family history of a wide variety of mental health conditions as well as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycistic kidneys.Began approximately 4 years ago. Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs.

Let's break down the situation and explore some potential avenues for you to pursue.\n\n**Summary of Your Symptoms and Medical History:**\n\n*   **Neurological:**\n    *   Severe headaches with tingling/numbness in face/limbs\n    *   Motor tics (uncontrollable, sometimes painful)\n    *   Fainting spells (resolved)\n    *   Convulsions with loss of consciousness (triggered by substances, sometimes occur sober; potential light sensitivity)\n    *   White matter findings on MRI (unexplained)\n    *   Memory problems (long-term and short-term)\n    *   Limb weakness\n    *   Fatigue (excessive sleep)\n*   **Medical History:**\n    *   Anemia (low folate, hematocrit, hemoglobin)\n    *   Malnourishment (low vitamin D, sodium)\n    *   High albumin\n    *   UTIs\n    *   Gastrointestinal issues (nausea, stomach pain after eating)\n    *   Family history of mental health conditions, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, polycystic kidney disease\n*   **Important Negative Findings:**\n    *   Normal EEG\n    *   Normal cardiac evaluation\n\n**Possible Explanations and Diagnostic Considerations:**\n\nGiven the breadth and complexity of your symptoms, it's essential to consider a range of possibilities, even if previous tests have been inconclusive. Here are some potential areas to explore with a doctor:\n\n1.  **Metabolic/Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n\n    *   **Re-evaluate Anemia & Malnutrition:**  The low folate, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamin D, and sodium are significant. It's crucial to determine the *cause* of these deficiencies.  Is it dietary?  Is there an absorption problem?  Is there an underlying condition causing these issues?  The GI problems could be related to this.\n    *   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel:** A more detailed metabolic panel to assess other electrolytes, liver function, kidney function, etc.\n    *   **Vitamin & Mineral Testing:** Beyond the ones already identified, consider testing for B12, magnesium, iron stores (ferritin), and other relevant micronutrients.\n    *   **Celiac Disease/Malabsorption:** Given the GI symptoms and nutritional deficiencies, get tested for celiac disease (blood test and potentially an endoscopy with biopsy if indicated). Also, consider other malabsorption syndromes.\n    *   **Porphyria:** Porphyria is a group of genetic disorders that can cause neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, and can be exacerbated by certain substances. It's worth considering, especially with the GI issues and seizure-like activity.\n\n2.  **Neurological Disorders:**\n\n    *   **Epilepsy (Beyond Standard EEG):**  A standard EEG may not capture all seizure activity.  Consider:\n        *   **Ambulatory EEG:**  This involves wearing an EEG monitor for several days to potentially capture events that might be missed in a short office visit.\n        *   **Video EEG Monitoring:**  Inpatient monitoring where EEG and video are recorded simultaneously to correlate symptoms with brain activity.\n    *   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  While it's important to rule out organic causes first, FND can present with neurological symptoms like tics, weakness, seizures, and sensory disturbances without detectable structural brain abnormalities.  It's often associated with stress or psychological factors, but it is a *real* condition, not just \"in your head.\"\n    *   **Migraine Variants:**  Some migraine variations can cause neurological symptoms like numbness, tingling, and weakness, even without headache pain.\n    *   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** While the initial MRI didn't show clear MS lesions, it's important to remember that MS can be tricky to diagnose, and white matter changes can sometimes be non-specific. A repeat MRI with contrast, and possibly a spinal tap, could be considered if symptoms persist.\n\n3.  **Autoimmune Disorders:**\n\n    *   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the brain, causing neurological symptoms like seizures, cognitive problems, and psychiatric disturbances.\n    *   **Lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome, Rheumatoid Arthritis:** These autoimmune diseases can sometimes affect the nervous system.\n    *   **Basic Autoimmune Screening:** ANA, rheumatoid factor, and other basic autoimmune markers.\n\n4.  **Toxicological:**\n\n    *   **Heavy Metal Testing:** Exposure to heavy metals can cause neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Mold Exposure:** Prolonged exposure to mold can also cause neurological symptoms.\n\n5.  **Cardiac:**\n\n    *   **Orthostatic Hypotension/POTS:** Though your initial cardiac workup was normal, consider further evaluation for orthostatic hypotension or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), especially given the fainting spells. These conditions can cause fatigue, lightheadedness, and even fainting.\n\n**Steps You Should Take:**\n\n1.  **Find a New Doctor:**\n    *   **Neurologist:** Find a different neurologist, preferably one who specializes in epilepsy or movement disorders. Look for someone who is known for being thorough and open-minded.  Consider a neurologist at a major academic medical center.\n    *   **Internal Medicine/General Practitioner:** Find a GP who is willing to act as a \"quarterback\" for your care, coordinating your different specialists and ensuring that all your symptoms are being addressed.\n2.  **Prepare for Appointments:**\n    *   **Detailed Symptom Log:** Keep a detailed log of your symptoms, including when they occur, what triggers them, how long they last, and their severity. Include information about your diet, sleep, and any stressors.\n    *   **Medical History:** Write down your entire medical history, including family history, medications, allergies, and previous tests.\n    *   **Questions:** Prepare a list of questions for your doctor.\n3.  **Advocate for Yourself:**\n    *   **Be Assertive:** Don't be afraid to push for the tests and referrals you think you need.\n    *   **Bring a Support Person:** If possible, bring a friend or family member to your appointments to help you remember information and advocate for you.\n    *   **Document Everything:** Keep copies of all your medical records.\n4.  **Consider Alternative Therapies (Complementary to Medical Care):**\n    *   **Mindfulness and Meditation:**  These practices can help manage stress and potentially reduce symptom severity.\n    *   **Acupuncture:** Some people find acupuncture helpful for managing pain and other neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Dietary Changes:** Consider consulting with a registered dietitian to optimize your diet and address any nutritional deficiencies.\n5.  **Don't Give Up:** It can be discouraging to feel dismissed by doctors, but it's important to keep searching for answers. Your symptoms are real, and you deserve to find out what's causing them.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Substance Use:** While you mention that the convulsions occur more frequently when under the influence of substances, it's crucial to honestly assess your substance use and how it might be impacting your health. Substance use can complicate diagnosis and treatment, and can worsen underlying medical conditions. Consider seeking help from a therapist, addiction specialist, or support group.\n*   **Mental Health:** Given the family history of mental health conditions, it's worth exploring whether anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues might be contributing to your symptoms. Mental health conditions can sometimes manifest with physical symptoms.\n\n**Regarding the High Albumin:**\n\nHigh albumin can be caused by dehydration, but also some liver or kidney issues. It's a finding that should be investigated further in the context of your other symptoms.\n\n**The \"Feeling Dismissed\" Issue:**\n\nUnfortunately, it's not uncommon for patients with complex or unusual symptoms to feel dismissed by doctors. This can be due to a variety of factors, including time constraints, diagnostic uncertainty, and biases. It's important to remember that you are the expert on your own body, and you have the right to advocate for your health.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThis is a complex case, and it will likely take time and persistence to find answers. Don't be afraid to seek second opinions and to advocate for yourself. I strongly encourage you to work with a doctor who is willing to listen to your concerns and take your symptoms seriously. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Hi all, I don\u2019t know if Im looking in the right place but wanted to get some advice I have these \u201cfits\u201d where for about 10 seconds I can\u2019t control my left side of my body or speak, it usually cause my arm to go up in the air, and my face to scrunch up, I am fully conscious and aware of what is happening during these episodes but I can\u2019t control them, I am able to tell when I am about to have one, they normally happen when I stand up to fast, and jumped unexpectedly, or when I\u2019m very nervous, I have had an EEG and an MRI scan about 4 years ago nothing showed up and no epilepsy was diagnosed either. I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and seeking answers after experiencing these episodes for so long, especially when they impact your daily life and haven't been clearly diagnosed.  Since you've already had an EEG and MRI that didn't reveal any specific neurological issues, and your doctor's advice was general, it's definitely worth exploring other avenues. Here's a breakdown of potential next steps and things to consider:\n\n**1.  Revisit Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   **New Neurologist, New Perspective:** It's often beneficial to get a second opinion from a different neurologist.  Different neurologists may have different areas of expertise or approaches to diagnosis.  Explain your symptoms in detail and emphasize the impact on your daily life.  Bring copies of your previous EEG and MRI results for them to review.\n\n*   **Detailed Symptom Log:** Keep a detailed log of your episodes for a few weeks *before* your appointment.  Include:\n    *   Date and Time\n    *   What you were doing immediately before the episode (standing up quickly, jumping, feeling nervous)\n    *   Specific description of what happens: arm movement, facial scrunching, speech difficulty, duration of symptoms (actual timing, even estimated), any tingling, numbness, or weakness.\n    *   What happens *after* the episode?  Do you feel tired, confused, have a headache, any lingering weakness?\n    *   Any potential triggers you can identify.\n    *   Anything that seems to help stop or lessen the episode.\n    *   What you were thinking/feeling before, during and after.\n    *   Witness information (if anyone was there to observe what was happening).\n\n*   **Ask Specific Questions:** Prepare a list of specific questions for the neurologist.  Examples:\n    *   \"Given my symptoms and the previous normal EEG and MRI, what other possible diagnoses should we consider?\"\n    *   \"Are there any other types of tests that could be helpful, even if they are more specialized?\"\n    *   \"Could this be related to any kind of paroxysmal movement disorder other than epilepsy?\"\n    *   \"Should I consider seeing a specialist in movement disorders or another related field?\"\n\n**2. Explore Other Potential Diagnoses (with your doctor):**\n\nBased on your description, here are some possible, *but by no means definitive*, conditions that a neurologist might consider (this list is for information purposes only and requires a professional medical diagnosis):\n\n*   **Focal Seizures:**  Even though your EEG was normal, it's possible you have focal seizures (seizures that start in one area of the brain) that are not always captured by a standard EEG, especially if the seizures are infrequent. A longer EEG monitoring session, possibly including video EEG, might be helpful.  Sometimes, special EEG electrodes are needed to be placed close to the scalp to help detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain, if the neurologist determines this is required.\n\n*   **PNES (Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures):**  These seizures look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are a manifestation of psychological distress and often stem from past trauma, anxiety, or other emotional issues. A *neurologist* should rule out epileptic seizures before a diagnosis of PNES can be considered.  Diagnosis usually involves video-EEG monitoring combined with a detailed psychological assessment.\n\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Some types of migraine can cause transient neurological symptoms, including weakness, speech difficulties, and sensory changes. These symptoms can occur *with or without* a headache. These are usually associated with aura.\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) - mini-stroke:** Although you are young this needs to be ruled out, TIAs cause temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain. This is more common in older people but can occur at any age.  The symptoms are usually very sudden in onset.\n\n*   **Paroxysmal Movement Disorders:** This is a broad category of disorders that cause sudden, involuntary movements. Some examples include:\n    *   **Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD):** Triggered by sudden movements or changes in posture.\n    *   **Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD):** Not triggered by movement, but may be triggered by stress or other factors.\n    *   **Paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia (PED):**  Triggered by exercise.\n\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  While this usually just causes lightheadedness or fainting, rarely, it can trigger other neurological symptoms. Your episodes happening when standing up quickly makes this worth considering.\n\n*   **Anxiety or Panic Attacks:**  In rare cases, severe anxiety or panic attacks can manifest with physical symptoms that mimic neurological events.\n\n**3. Additional Testing & Referrals:**\n\nBased on the neurologist's evaluation, they may recommend:\n\n*   **Prolonged EEG Monitoring (Video EEG):** This involves being monitored for 24-72 hours (or longer) with continuous EEG recording and video recording. This increases the chances of capturing an event if they are infrequent.\n*   **Ambulatory EEG:**  Wearing an EEG monitor at home for several days.\n*   **Repeat MRI with Specialized Protocols:**  Sometimes, a more detailed MRI scan using specific imaging techniques can reveal subtle abnormalities.\n*   **Tilt Table Test:** To assess for orthostatic hypotension or other autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\n*   **Referral to a Movement Disorder Specialist:**  If a movement disorder is suspected.\n*   **Referral to a Neuropsychologist or Psychologist:** If PNES or psychological factors are being considered.\n*   **Cardiac Evaluation:** Rarely, heart rhythm problems can cause neurological symptoms.\n\n**4. Lifestyle Management (Even Though You've Heard It Before):**\n\nWhile a \"healthy lifestyle\" is general advice, specific attention to these aspects *might* help:\n\n*   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or mindfulness.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water, especially if you suspect orthostatic hypotension.\n*   **Regular Exercise:**  But avoid triggering activities if possible.  Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Get adequate sleep on a regular schedule.\n*   **Diet:** Maintain a balanced diet.\n*   **Avoid Triggers:** As much as possible, try to avoid situations that trigger your episodes, such as sudden movements or extreme nervousness.\n\n**5. Advocate for Yourself:**\n\n*   Don't be afraid to push for answers and seek second opinions.\n*   Keep meticulous records of your symptoms.\n*   Clearly communicate the impact of these episodes on your quality of life.\n*   Research potential diagnoses (but always discuss your findings with your doctor).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't self-diagnose.** The information provided here is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n*   **Driving:** Depending on the frequency and nature of your episodes, driving might be restricted. Discuss this with your doctor.\n*   **Safety:** Take precautions to prevent injury during episodes.  If you're prone to these while standing, try to sit down if you feel an episode coming on.\n*   **Support:**  Consider joining a support group for people with similar symptoms or chronic conditions. Sharing experiences can be helpful.\n\nThe key is to be persistent, proactive, and work closely with your medical team to explore all possibilities and find a diagnosis and treatment plan that works for you. It's a journey, but you're taking the right steps by seeking information and advocating for your health. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "[21M] epileptic from quemotherapy, and 5 years cancer free.Is there a variation that could allow me to safely take them? For instance \"lf you have X specific kind of epilepsy, or if you aren't taking X medication you can take them\" Does the dose matter? I have read people say that would have seizures when microdosing but not when doing high doses. How does that work? Thank you so much!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're looking for information about the safety of taking psychedelics given your history of epilepsy and cancer treatment.  It's essential that I emphasize that **I am not a medical professional and cannot provide medical advice.**  Mixing psychedelics with your specific medical history could be risky, and it's crucial to consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider before considering any such use.  They can assess your individual situation, consider your medications, and provide personalized guidance based on your health status.\n\nThat said, I can share some general information and considerations that might be helpful to discuss with your doctor:\n\n*   **Epilepsy and Psychedelics:** Psychedelics can lower the seizure threshold in some individuals, meaning it may become easier for a seizure to occur. This is a significant concern for people with epilepsy. The risk may vary depending on the type of epilepsy, the frequency and severity of seizures, and any medications you're currently taking.\n*   **Chemotherapy and Cancer History:** Chemotherapy can have long-lasting effects on the brain and nervous system. It's important to consider these potential effects when evaluating the safety of psychedelics.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Psychedelics can interact with various medications, including anticonvulsants. These interactions could potentially increase the risk of seizures or other adverse effects.\n*   **Dosage and Seizure Risk:** You mentioned hearing about people experiencing seizures at microdoses but not at higher doses. This is not a well-established phenomenon and is not supported by scientific evidence. Seizure risk with psychedelics is more complex.\n*   **Specific Variations:** There is no \"safe\" variation or condition I can suggest that would guarantee safety. Every individual's reaction to psychedelics is unique, and your medical history adds further complexity.\n\n**Important Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Doctor:** The most important step is to discuss your interest in psychedelics with your doctor or neurologist. They can evaluate your specific case and provide personalized advice.\n2.  **Be Honest and Thorough:** When speaking with your doctor, be honest about your intentions and provide a complete medical history, including all medications and treatments you've received.\n3.  **Consider Alternatives:** If your doctor advises against using psychedelics, explore alternative therapies or approaches to address any mental health concerns you may have.\n\nIt's understandable that you're seeking ways to potentially benefit from psychedelics, but your safety is paramount.  Please prioritize consulting with qualified healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about your health."

    "question": "I am 20M (age,sex) and currently on lamotrigine (150mg/day)I was \u2018diagnosed \u2019 with epilepsy over two years ago. (When I was 18) I have never been evaluated for adhd.In the two years I started noticing some attention problem. (Adhd-like symptom).. Being distracted by other things, etc sometimes it could be \u2018fixated\u2019 to something even it\u2019s not important and I was Chasing deadlines for assignments etc. I just cannot get my mind off those shits and start procrastinating things that are very important .I tried different methods such as setting my phone\u2019s wall paper to a photo I took, the view of a famous university I\u2019ve been looking forward to admit to. It only worked for a very short period of time. Not until the very last moment then I starts to regret and do whatever I can to complete the assignment/ important things.These behaviors is driving me crazy, also my GPA.I feel very nervous about meeting the conditional offer from the famous university because all of this. I really needed the offer and cannot afford losing it.I spoke to a counselor at my college and she thought, despite she doesn\u2019t think I have adhd, but considering I have epilepsy. Maybe I could seek advice from a doctor, but a specialist consultation can cost a lot\u2026",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. You're 20, on lamotrigine for epilepsy, experiencing ADHD-like symptoms that are impacting your studies and causing significant stress about your conditional university offer. You've tried some strategies to improve focus, but they haven't been effective long-term. You're concerned about the cost of a specialist consultation. Let's break this down and explore potential next steps.\n\n**Here's a summary of the key issues:**\n\n*   **Possible ADHD-like Symptoms:** Difficulty focusing, distractibility, procrastination, fixation on unimportant tasks, deadline chasing, and feelings of regret.\n*   **Impact on Academics:** Declining GPA, jeopardizing conditional university offer.\n*   **Financial Concerns:** Worried about the cost of a specialist consultation.\n*   **Epilepsy and Lamotrigine:** Relevant medical context, as both can potentially affect cognition and mood.\n*   **Counselor's Perspective:** Counselor acknowledges the challenges but doesn't necessarily see ADHD.\n\n**What could be causing these symptoms?**\n\nIt's important to understand that the symptoms you're experiencing could be due to a few different things, or a combination:\n\n*   **ADHD:** This is certainly a possibility, and it's wise to explore it further.\n*   **Epilepsy Medications:** Lamotrigine, while generally well-tolerated, *can* have cognitive side effects in some individuals, affecting attention, memory, and executive function.\n*   **Epilepsy Itself:** Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with cognitive difficulties, even when seizures are well-controlled. Some types of epilepsy can affect attention and executive functions.\n*   **Anxiety and Stress:** The pressure of maintaining your GPA, the anticipation of university admission, and the frustration of your current struggles can all contribute to anxiety, which can *mimic* ADHD symptoms.\n*   **Depression:** Similar to anxiety, depression can affect concentration and motivation.\n*   **Other Medical Conditions:** While less likely, it's important to rule out other medical causes.\n*   **Lifestyle Factors:** Sleep, diet, exercise, and stress levels can all impact cognitive function.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Neurologist:** This is the *most important* first step. Since you're already seeing a neurologist for epilepsy, they are the best person to evaluate whether your symptoms could be related to your epilepsy, medication, or something else.  Specifically, ask your neurologist:\n    *   \"I've been experiencing difficulty concentrating and focusing, similar to what I've heard about ADHD. Could this be related to my epilepsy or the lamotrigine?\"\n    *   \"Are there any cognitive side effects associated with lamotrigine that could explain these symptoms?\"\n    *   \"Are there alternative epilepsy medications that might have a better cognitive profile?\" (This is a discussion, not necessarily a demand for a change).\n    *   \"Would you recommend further neuropsychological testing or referral to a psychiatrist/specialist for further evaluation?\"\n    *   \"Can we rule out any medical causes for my symptoms?\"\n    Your neurologist may adjust your medication if they believe it's contributing to the problem.\n\n2.  **Explore Affordable Assessment Options:**\n    *   **University Counseling Services:** Inquire about ADHD assessment services offered through your university. Some universities offer free or low-cost assessments to students. You've already spoken to a counselor, but specifically ask if they can help you access assessments.\n    *   **Student Health Services:** Your university's student health services may offer a preliminary ADHD screening or be able to refer you to more affordable resources.\n    *   **Local Mental Health Clinics:** Look for community mental health clinics in your area. These clinics often offer sliding scale fees based on income. Search online for \"[your city/county] community mental health services.\"\n    *   **Teaching Hospitals:** Teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools often have psychiatry or neurology departments that offer assessments at reduced rates.\n\n3.  **Advocate for Yourself with your Insurance:** Even if a specialist consultation is expensive, try to find out the exact cost and what portion of the fee is covered by your insurance. Sometimes, if you can get an initial referral from your primary care physician, it will significantly reduce the cost if the doctor in specialist network.\n\n4.  **Document Your Symptoms:** Keep a detailed log of your symptoms, including:\n    *   When they occur\n    *   What triggers them\n    *   How they impact your daily life\n    *   What strategies you've tried and whether they worked\n    This information will be helpful for any healthcare professional you consult.\n\n5.  **Consider Lifestyle Adjustments:** While you explore medical explanations, make sure you're prioritizing:\n    *   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n    *   **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet with regular meals. Avoid excessive sugar and caffeine.\n    *   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve focus and mood.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n    *   **Time Management:** Explore different time management strategies, such as the Pomodoro Technique or creating a detailed schedule.\n\n6.  **Communicate with Your Professors:** Explain your situation to your professors and let them know you're working on addressing the issue. They may be able to offer accommodations or support.\n\n7.  **Be Patient and Persistent:** Getting to the root cause of your symptoms and finding effective treatment can take time. Don't get discouraged if the first approach doesn't work. Keep advocating for yourself and working with healthcare professionals to find a solution.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Self-diagnosis is not recommended:** While it's good to be aware of your symptoms and research potential causes, it's crucial to get a professional evaluation to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n*   **Medication is not the only answer:** Even if you are diagnosed with ADHD, medication may not be the only or best treatment option. Therapy, lifestyle changes, and other strategies can also be very effective.\n\n**Regarding your university offer:**\n\n*   **Contact the Admissions Office:** Explain your situation and ask if there's any flexibility with the conditional offer requirements. They may be understanding and willing to work with you, especially if you can demonstrate that you're actively seeking help for your challenges.\n\n**In summary, your immediate next step should be to schedule an appointment with your neurologist to discuss your symptoms and explore potential connections to your epilepsy and medication. While waiting for that appointment, start exploring more affordable assessment options through your university or local community mental health services.**\n\nI hope this helps! Remember, you're not alone, and there are resources available to support you. Be proactive, patient, and persistent in seeking help.\n"

I will do my best to be brief. I have had serious mental health issues since I was a child. First suicide attempt was at 7. Institutionalized at 15 for suicidal ideation, and have had therapy since then. I restarted medications at 21. I have had a lot of bad experiences with medical professionals. Very abusive docs when institutionalized. My last doctor told me to treat my bipolar disorder with a multivitamin. The doctor before prescribed me an anti depressant, had a manic episode, then changed to lamictal 100mg. He also called me a drug seeker because I wanted muscle relaxers to treat a weird medical episode that was causing severe neck pain. This turned out to be abdominal epilepsy. I have used urgent cares on rare occasion to get antibiotics, etc. But I haven't had a pcp since I was 20. How can I find a PCP that is comfortable working with mental health patients? What do I need to have done to get on track? I am aware that I am extremely high risk for suicide, between bipolar, loss of a sibling to suicide, childhood sexual abuse. I feel it's more important than ever to get a grip on my physical health so I can have a long life with my wife and my parents, and live to take care of them in their golden years. Currently see a therapist and a psych for med management. I'm also working with my therapist now to work through my problems with seeking medical care. Any other questions I am happy to ask.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation, but it's absolutely commendable that you're taking proactive steps to address your physical and mental health. Finding the right PCP who understands your needs and history is crucial. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how to find a suitable PCP and get back on track:\n\n**1. Leveraging Your Existing Care Team:**\n\n*   **Talk to Your Therapist and Psychiatrist:** This is the most immediate and often the most fruitful route.\n    *   **Ask for Recommendations:** Tell them you're looking for a PCP comfortable managing patients with complex mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, anxiety, and a history of trauma. They likely have colleagues or know PCPs who are particularly understanding and knowledgeable.\n    *   **Inquire About Shared Care Models:** Some mental health practices have integrated primary care or have established relationships with PCPs who are familiar with their patients. Ask if such a system exists or if they can facilitate communication with a potential PCP.\n    *   **Discuss Your Past Negative Experiences:** Let them know you've had negative experiences with doctors in the past. This will help them tailor their recommendations to providers who are known for their empathy, communication skills, and patient-centered approach.\n*   **Collaborative Care:** Ideally, your PCP, therapist, and psychiatrist should communicate (with your consent). Ask your current providers if they are open to sharing information or consulting with a PCP you choose.\n\n**2. Finding a PCP Independently:**\n\n*   **Utilize Online Search Tools with Specific Filters:**\n    *   **Psychology Today:** Many therapists and psychiatrists list providers in the area. You may be able to search for PCPs as well.\n    *   **\"Behavioral health\" or \"Mental health\" \"Special populations\":** This may help you find a provider who has interest or training in working with mental health issues.\n*   **Ask for Referrals from Trusted Sources:**\n    *   **Friends, Family, Support Groups:** If you're comfortable, ask people you trust if they have a PCP they like who is understanding and approachable.\n    *   **Local Mental Health Organizations:** They may maintain lists of providers known for being supportive of individuals with mental health conditions.\n*   **Contact the Psychology Department of Local Hospitals or Universities:** These may offer outpatient primary care or have faculty physicians known for their expertise in integrative care.\n\n**3. Evaluating Potential PCPs:**\n\n*   **Before Scheduling an Appointment (Initial Phone Call):**\n    *   **Inquire About Their Experience:** Don't hesitate to ask the receptionist or nurse if the doctor has experience treating patients with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.  You can phrase it as, \"Does Dr. [Name] have experience coordinating care for patients with complex mental health needs, including bipolar disorder and anxiety?\"\n    *   **Ask About Their Approach:** Inquire about their approach to integrated care or their willingness to collaborate with your mental health team.\n    *   **Assess Their Communication Style:** Pay attention to how you're treated on the phone.  Are they patient, respectful, and willing to answer your questions?\n*   **First Appointment:**\n    *   **Be Open and Honest:** Share your medical and mental health history, including your past negative experiences with healthcare providers. This will help the doctor understand your needs and build trust.\n    *   **Evaluate Their Bedside Manner:**  Do they listen attentively? Do they seem genuinely interested in your well-being? Do they explain things clearly and answer your questions thoroughly?\n    *   **Discuss Their Approach to Collaboration:**  Specifically ask how they plan to coordinate care with your therapist and psychiatrist.  Do they prefer to communicate via phone, email, or written reports?\n    *   **Assess Their Comfort Level:** How do they react when you discuss your mental health history? Do they seem dismissive, uncomfortable, or genuinely supportive?\n    *   **Trust Your Gut:**  If something feels off or you don't feel comfortable with the doctor, it's okay to look for someone else.\n\n**4. Getting Back on Track with Your Physical Health:**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Physical Exam:** Schedule a thorough physical exam with your new PCP. This should include:\n    *   **Review of Medications:** Bring a list of all medications you're taking, including dosages and frequency.  Discuss potential side effects and interactions.\n    *   **Blood Work:** Routine blood tests to check cholesterol, blood sugar, thyroid function, liver function, and kidney function.\n    *   **Vaccination Review:** Ensure you're up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations.\n    *   **Cancer Screenings:** Discuss age-appropriate cancer screenings, such as colonoscopies, mammograms (if applicable), and prostate exams.\n    *   **Nutritional Assessment:** Discuss your diet and identify any potential deficiencies.\n    *   **Mental Health Screening:** A brief mental health screening to assess your current mood and anxiety levels. This can help your PCP better understand your needs and coordinate care with your mental health team.\n*   **Address Specific Health Concerns:**\n    *   **Acid Reflux:** Discuss your Omeprazole dosage and whether it's effectively controlling your symptoms.  Explore lifestyle modifications, such as diet changes and avoiding triggers.\n    *   **Abdominal Epilepsy:** Ensure your abdominal epilepsy is being adequately managed. Discuss any recent changes in symptoms or concerns.\n    *   **Substance Use:** Be honest with your PCP about your tobacco and marijuana use.  They can provide resources for quitting tobacco and discuss the potential impact of marijuana on your mental and physical health.\n    *   **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Follow your doctor's recommendations for Vitamin D supplementation.\n*   **Establish Healthy Habits:**\n    *   **Regular Exercise:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n    *   **Balanced Diet:** Focus on eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.\n    *   **Adequate Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n    *   **Stress Management Techniques:** Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n**5. Addressing Your Concerns About Medical Care:**\n\n*   **Continue Working with Your Therapist:**  Your therapist is already helping you address your problems with seeking medical care. Continue to explore your past negative experiences and develop coping mechanisms for managing anxiety and fear related to medical appointments.\n*   **Prepare for Appointments:**\n    *   **Write Down Your Questions:**  Before each appointment, write down a list of questions you want to ask. This will help you stay focused and ensure you get the information you need.\n    *   **Bring a Support Person:**  If you feel anxious or overwhelmed, consider bringing a trusted friend or family member with you to appointments.\n    *   **Take Notes:**  Take notes during the appointment to help you remember what was discussed.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to speak up if you don't understand something or if you disagree with a recommendation. Remember, you have the right to ask questions and make informed decisions about your health.\n*   **Consider a Patient Advocate:**  If you continue to struggle with navigating the healthcare system, consider working with a patient advocate.  A patient advocate can help you understand your rights, navigate insurance issues, and communicate effectively with your healthcare providers.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Medical Emergency:** If you are experiencing a medical emergency, such as severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or suicidal thoughts, seek immediate medical attention. Do not delay seeking help because of past negative experiences.\n*   **Suicide Risk:** Given your history of suicide attempts and risk factors, it is crucial to prioritize your mental health. Continue to work closely with your therapist and psychiatrist, and develop a safety plan that includes steps you can take if you experience suicidal thoughts.  Know your triggers and coping mechanisms.\n\nYou are taking significant and important steps toward a healthier future. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your progress, and remember that you deserve to receive respectful and compassionate care. By being proactive and advocating for your needs, you can find a PCP who will be a valuable partner in your journey toward wellness.\n"

    "question": "My bf is a 33M, 220 lbs, history of epilepsy, high cholesterol, has high blood pressure on occasion, ADD, allergy to augmentin, and kiwi. He takes lamotrigine, phenobarbital, Lamictal. He vapes, never drinks, and smokes marijuana on occasion. He hasn't had a seizure in three years fortunately. He went to the Dr yesterday and his Dr told him his med levels are at a level 2 when they should be at around a 7. Dr showed him that the levels dropped to dangerous levels in three years despite an increase in meds in those years. Any insight in what this could be? He's waiting on more blood tests.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation with several factors potentially influencing his medication levels. It's essential to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. He absolutely needs to continue working closely with his doctor to figure out the cause and adjust his treatment plan. That being said, I can offer some potential explanations and questions his doctor might explore, based on the information you've provided.\n\n**Possible Explanations for Decreasing Lamotrigine/Phenobarbital Levels (Despite Dosage Increase):**\n\n*   **Changes in Metabolism:**\n    *   **Weight Changes:** While he is currently 220lbs, has his weight significantly changed since the medication was started? Weight gain or loss can impact drug distribution and metabolism.\n    *   **Age-Related Changes:** While 33 isn't \"old,\" metabolic processes can subtly change over time.\n    *   **Liver Function:** The liver is crucial for metabolizing many drugs, including lamotrigine and phenobarbital. Even without overt liver disease, subtle changes in liver function could affect drug clearance. His doctor will likely check liver function tests (LFTs) in the blood work.\n    *   **Kidney Function:** While less directly involved in lamotrigine/phenobarbital metabolism, kidney function affects overall drug elimination.\n\n*   **Drug Interactions:**\n    *   **Smoking Marijuana:** Marijuana can interact with some medications, potentially affecting their metabolism. This is especially true with chronic use. The impact on lamotrigine and phenobarbital specifically is complex and may vary from person to person. It's something his doctor needs to consider.\n    *   **Vaping:** While the exact impact of vaping on drug metabolism isn't fully understood, it can introduce chemicals into the body that *could* potentially influence liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism.\n    *   **Other Medications/Supplements:** Has he started taking any new over-the-counter medications, supplements (vitamins, herbal remedies), or even certain foods regularly? These can sometimes interfere with drug absorption or metabolism.\n\n*   **Adherence:**\n    *   **Missing Doses:** It's important to rule out the possibility of unintentionally missing doses. He needs to be honest with his doctor about his medication adherence.\n    *   **Timing of Doses:** Is he taking the medication at the same time(s) each day? Consistent timing helps maintain stable blood levels.\n\n*   **Changes in Formulation/Brand:**\n    *   **Generic vs. Brand Name:** Has he switched from a brand-name medication to a generic version, or vice versa? While generics are supposed to be bioequivalent, slight differences in absorption can sometimes occur.\n    *   **Manufacturing Changes:** Rarely, there can be changes in the manufacturing process that affect drug bioavailability (how much of the drug gets into the bloodstream).\n\n*   **Absorption Issues:**\n    *   **Gastrointestinal Problems:** Any new gastrointestinal issues could affect how well the medication is absorbed from the gut.\n\n**Questions His Doctor Might Ask/Investigate:**\n\n*   **Detailed Medication History:** A complete list of all medications, supplements, and recreational drug use (including frequency and amount).\n*   **Dietary Changes:** Any significant changes in diet?\n*   **GI Issues:** Any changes in bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, etc.?\n*   **Liver and Kidney Function Tests:** To assess the health of these organs.\n*   **Repeat Lamotrigine/Phenobarbital Levels:** To confirm the initial results and establish a baseline.\n*   **Assessment of Adherence:** How often does he take his medication and at what times?\n*   **Neurological Exam:** To assess for any subtle neurological changes that might not be obvious.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** While he hasn't had seizures, an EEG might be considered to assess brain activity.\n\n**Why \"Dangerous\" Levels Are a Concern:**\n\n*   **Seizure Risk:** The primary concern is breakthrough seizures if the medication levels are too low to effectively control his epilepsy.\n*   **Loss of Efficacy:** Even without seizures, subtherapeutic levels might not be adequately managing the underlying neurological condition.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Do NOT change the medication dosage on your own.** Any adjustments need to be made under the direct supervision of his doctor.\n*   **Be honest with the doctor.** Withholding information can make it difficult to determine the cause of the problem.\n*   **Follow up on all recommended tests and appointments.**\n\nThe fact that his doctor is ordering more blood tests is a good sign that they are taking the situation seriously and trying to find the underlying cause. It may take some time and investigation to figure out what's going on, but it's important to be patient and work closely with his healthcare team."

    "question": "Age: 21 Sex: Female (But I go by He/Him) Height: 5'3 Weight: 106lbsOver the past few months I've been seeing a psychiatrist and she's put me on numerous pills. The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been. And every now and then I'm seeing things like a weird grey cloud with a face in my bedroom or I'll think my hands are turning grey when they aren't.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, that sounds like a really distressing experience, and it's understandable that you're feeling so unwell and frustrated with the lack of support you're receiving. It's important to address several points here.\n\n**1. The Weed Interaction:**\n\n*   **Interaction with Medications:** The combination of Wellbutrin, Venlafaxine, and Hydroxyzine can potentially interact with cannabis. Both Wellbutrin and Venlafaxine affect neurotransmitters in the brain, and cannabis can also influence these systems. This can lead to unpredictable and amplified effects, including anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, and changes in heart rate and blood pressure.\n*   **Your Experience:** What you described sounds like a severe panic attack exacerbated by the effects of cannabis. The muscle tension, shaking, hallucinations, and fear of death are all consistent with this. Even if you had used cannabis before without issue, the introduction of these medications could have altered your reaction.\n*   **Lingering Effects:** It's not uncommon to feel \"off\" for a while after a very intense experience like that. The trauma of the panic attack itself can contribute to increased anxiety, depression, and even a sense of derealization (feeling like things aren't real).\n\n**2. Concerns about Your Current Symptoms and Medication Changes:**\n\n*   **Suicidal Thoughts:** The increase in suicidal thoughts is extremely concerning. It's crucial that you address this immediately.\n*   **Physical Pain and Fatigue:** The persistent muscle pain, joint pain, and fatigue need to be investigated further. While stress and anxiety can contribute to physical symptoms, it's important to rule out other potential causes.\n*   **Visual Hallucinations:** The grey cloud with a face and the perception of your hands turning grey are also concerning. While these could be related to anxiety or medication side effects, they warrant careful evaluation.\n*   **Oxcarbazepine:** This medication is typically used as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. Its use in your case suggests that your psychiatrist may be considering a diagnosis beyond depression and anxiety, or is trying to manage mood swings more effectively. However, it's important to understand why this medication was added and what the psychiatrist hopes to achieve with it.\n*   **Weaning off Venlafaxine:** Discontinuing Venlafaxine should be done very slowly and under close medical supervision. Abrupt withdrawal can cause significant side effects, including anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, and sensory disturbances.\n*   **Lack of Support from Psychiatrist:** This is a major issue. You need a psychiatrist who listens to your concerns, takes your symptoms seriously, and provides clear explanations for medication choices.\n\n**3. Important Steps You Need to Take:**\n\n*   **Immediate Safety:**\n    *   **If you are having active suicidal thoughts or feel like you are in immediate danger to yourself, please go to the nearest emergency room or call 911 (or your local emergency number).**\n    *   **You can also call the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.** They are available 24/7 and can provide immediate support.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** You need to be assertive with your psychiatrist and insist that your concerns are addressed.  Write down a list of your symptoms and questions before your appointment.\n*   **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you are not satisfied with your current psychiatrist, seek a second opinion from another qualified psychiatrist. A fresh perspective can be invaluable.\n*   **Communicate Honestly:** Be completely honest with your psychiatrist (or a new one) about your symptoms, including the visual hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and physical pain. Don't downplay anything, even if you feel embarrassed or ashamed.\n*   **Ask Specific Questions:**\n    *   Why was Oxcarbazepine added to my medication regimen? What is it supposed to do?\n    *   What are the potential side effects of Oxcarbazepine?\n    *   How will weaning off Venlafaxine affect me, and what should I expect?\n    *   What could be causing my muscle pain, joint pain, and fatigue?\n    *   What could be causing the visual hallucinations?\n    *   What is the long-term plan for my medication management?\n*   **Explore Therapy:** Consider adding psychotherapy (talk therapy) to your treatment plan. A therapist can help you process the trauma of the panic attack, manage your anxiety and depression, and develop coping skills. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are often helpful for anxiety and mood disorders.\n*   **Medical Evaluation:** Request a thorough physical examination from your primary care physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your physical symptoms.\n*   **Avoid Cannabis and Alcohol:** It is best to avoid these substances completely, as they can interfere with your medications and worsen your mental health symptoms.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Your Identity:**\n\n*   **Respect for Pronouns:** I understand that you use he/him pronouns, and I will do my best to respect that. It is important that your healthcare providers also respect your identity and use the correct pronouns and terminology. If you experience disrespect or discrimination from your psychiatrist or other healthcare professionals, it is important to address this directly or seek care from a provider who is more affirming.\n\n**In summary,** what you're experiencing is serious and requires immediate attention. Please prioritize your safety, advocate for yourself with healthcare providers, and don't hesitate to seek additional support. You are not alone, and there are people who want to help you get better.\n"

    "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's excellent that you have a doctor's appointment scheduled. It's always the best course of action to discuss these symptoms with a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThat being said, it's understandable to want to gather more information and perspectives in the meantime. Given the symptoms you've described, your concerns about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) are certainly worth exploring with your doctor. Here's a breakdown of why that is, and some additional considerations:\n\n**Why TLE Could Be a Consideration (But Not Necessarily the Answer):**\n\n*   **Auras:** The sensory auras you describe (random pleasant tastes and smells, bursts of euphoria, dissociation) are common features of TLE. These are actually small, localized seizures within the temporal lobe.\n*   **Sleep-Related Phenomena:** The semi-conscious, dream-like states with buzzing sensations, memory loss, and feelings of exhaustion can be associated with nocturnal seizures or altered brain activity during sleep. The \"locked-in\" feeling and head movements, particularly the head-banging incident, could potentially be related to seizure activity or other sleep disorders.\n*   **Family History:** The presence of epilepsy in your family history increases the likelihood of you having a seizure disorder, although it doesn't guarantee it.\n*   **Onset:** The onset of symptoms in childhood (around age 10) is consistent with some types of epilepsy.\n\n**However, It's Important to Consider Other Possibilities:**\n\n*   **Migraines:** While you've previously attributed these symptoms to migraine auras, it's worth reconsidering. Migraines can present with a wide variety of neurological symptoms, and some can mimic seizure activity. However, the buzzing sensations and the dream-like states might be less typical for classic migraine auras.\n*   **Sleep Disorders:** These symptoms could indicate a sleep disorder, such as:\n\n    *   **Parasomnias:** (sleepwalking, night terrors)\n    *   **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** These hallucinations occur as you're falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic) and can be very vivid and sometimes bizarre.\n    *   **Sleep Paralysis:** You've already mentioned this. It can occur alone or as a symptom of narcolepsy.\n    *   **Other Sleep-Related Movement Disorders:** Things like restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and potentially contribute to unusual experiences.\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Disorder:** While you don't specifically mention anxiety, it's worth noting that anxiety and panic disorders can sometimes manifest with physical symptoms that could be misinterpreted as neurological.\n*   **Dissociative Disorders:** The dissociation you experience could be a separate issue, potentially related to stress, trauma, or other psychological factors.\n*   **Vestibular Issues:** Although less likely to cause the full range of symptoms you describe, problems with the inner ear (vestibular system) can sometimes cause dizziness, imbalance, and unusual sensations.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Doctor's Appointment:**\n\nYour doctor will likely take the following steps:\n\n*   **Detailed History:** Be prepared to describe your symptoms in as much detail as possible, including the frequency, duration, triggers (if any), and how they affect your daily life.\n*   **Neurological Exam:** This will involve testing your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, sensation, and other neurological functions.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This test records the electrical activity in your brain. It can help identify abnormal brainwave patterns that are characteristic of epilepsy.\n*   **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):** If a sleep disorder is suspected, a sleep study may be recommended to monitor your brain activity, heart rate, breathing, and muscle movements during sleep.\n*   **MRI of the Brain:** This imaging test can help rule out structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing your symptoms.\n*   **Other Tests:** Depending on the findings, your doctor may order other tests to rule out other potential causes.\n\n**Important Considerations for Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Be Honest and Thorough:** Don't hold back any information, even if you think it's irrelevant.\n*   **Write Down Your Symptoms:** Keep a log of your symptoms, including the date, time, duration, and any potential triggers. This will be very helpful for your doctor.\n*   **Bring a List of Questions:** Prepare a list of questions you have for your doctor.\n*   **Bring Someone With You:** If possible, bring a friend or family member to your appointment to help you remember information and ask questions.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYour symptoms warrant further investigation. The possibility of TLE or another type of epilepsy should be explored, but it's also important to consider other potential causes, such as sleep disorders, migraines, anxiety, or dissociative disorders. Your doctor will be able to determine the most appropriate course of action after a thorough evaluation.\n\nGood luck with your appointment! I hope you get some answers and find a way to manage your symptoms effectively.\n"

Things such as normal car headlights and signals have not caused a problem, however when it\u2019s been raining or wet it causes the lights to be reflected off the pools of water it often disorients me and causes a dizzy feeling. I am in An area where it doesn\u2019t rain now and yesterday had to drive through a tunnel covered with a crazy amount of LED lights, and with them reflecting off the cars I became almost instantly overwhelmingly dizzy and nauseous and had to pull over for 15 minutes for it to stop. I am not sure what is causing it, but I am afraid to drive at night or in certain areas because of this issue.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a very uncomfortable and potentially dangerous experience.  It's good you're taking it seriously and trying to figure out what's going on. The combination of light sensitivity, dizziness, and nausea you're experiencing in specific visual environments warrants further exploration. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and steps you can take:\n\n**Possible Causes & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Visual Sensitivity/Migraine Variant:**  This is a strong possibility.\n    *   *Photosensitivity*: Many people experience heightened sensitivity to light, which can manifest as discomfort, eye strain, headaches, and even nausea.  Certain types of light (fluorescent, LED) and flickering patterns are often triggers.\n    *   *Migraine-Associated Vertigo*:  Even without a classic headache, migraines can present with dizziness, nausea, and visual disturbances.  Bright, flashing lights are common migraine triggers.\n    *   *Vestibular Migraine:* A type of migraine where the primary symptom is dizziness or vertigo, with or without headache. Lights can be a trigger.\n\n*   **Vestibular (Inner Ear) Issues:**\n    *   *Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)*: While usually triggered by head movements, visual input can sometimes exacerbate symptoms.\n    *   *Meniere's Disease*:  Less likely, but possible.  It involves inner ear issues that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.\n    *   *Vestibular Neuritis/Labyrinthitis*: Inflammation of the inner ear can cause vertigo and dizziness.\n\n*   **Vision Problems:**\n    *   *Astigmatism*:  An irregular curvature of the cornea or lens can cause blurred vision and halos around lights, especially at night.  This can lead to eye strain and headaches.\n    *   *Binocular Vision Dysfunction (BVD)*: Problems with how your eyes work together can cause dizziness, headaches, and sensitivity to light.\n\n*   **Neurological Issues:**\n    *   *While you have no history of seizures, photosensitivity can sometimes be related to underlying neurological conditions, although rare given your age and history.*\n\n*   **Anxiety/Panic:** While less likely to be the root cause, the experience itself can be frightening and trigger an anxiety response, which can worsen symptoms.\n\n*   **Other Medical Conditions:**\n    *   Less likely, but dehydration, low blood sugar, or certain medications could contribute to dizziness.\n\n**Immediate Steps to Take:**\n\n1.  **Consult an Eye Doctor (Ophthalmologist or Optometrist):**  This should be your *first* step.  A comprehensive eye exam can rule out or identify vision problems like astigmatism, binocular vision issues, and other eye diseases.  Tell the eye doctor *specifically* about your sensitivity to lights, dizziness, and the situations in which it occurs.\n\n2.  **Consult a Physician:**\n    *   If the eye exam is normal, *or* if you have other symptoms (e.g., hearing loss, tinnitus, headaches) that suggest a non-eye-related cause, see a physician.\n    *   Describe your symptoms in detail, including when they started, what triggers them, and how they affect your daily life.\n    *   Your physician can assess for other potential medical conditions and may refer you to a neurologist or an ENT specialist (ear, nose, and throat doctor).\n\n3.  **Neurologist Consultation (Potential):**  A neurologist can evaluate for migraine variants, neurological conditions, and recommend further testing if needed (e.g., EEG, MRI).\n\n4.  **ENT (Otolaryngologist) Consultation (Potential):** An ENT can assess your inner ear function and rule out or diagnose vestibular disorders.  They may perform tests like a VNG (videonystagmography) to evaluate your balance system.\n\n**Things You Can Do in the Meantime:**\n\n*   **Sunglasses:**  Wear high-quality sunglasses during the day, even on cloudy days.  Consider polarized lenses, which can reduce glare.\n*   **Night Driving Glasses:**  Yellow-tinted glasses designed for night driving may help reduce glare from headlights, but their effectiveness varies.  Discuss with your eye doctor.\n*   **Avoid Triggers:** As much as possible, avoid situations that you know trigger your symptoms (e.g., driving in heavy rain at night, tunnels with excessive LED lighting).\n*   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce stress and anxiety.\n*   **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n*   **Diet:**  Eat regular meals to avoid low blood sugar.  Consider keeping a food diary to see if any foods seem to trigger your symptoms.\n*   **Driving Safety:** If you experience dizziness or nausea while driving, pull over to a safe location immediately. Do not continue driving until the symptoms subside.\n*   **Document Episodes:** Keep a log of when the symptoms occur, what you were doing, and what the lighting conditions were like. This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's crucial to get a professional diagnosis before starting any treatment.\n*   **Driving Safety:** If you are concerned about your safety while driving, consider limiting your driving or having someone else drive you.\n*   **Be Patient:**  It may take some time to figure out the cause of your symptoms and find an effective treatment.\n\nThis is a complex issue, and a thorough evaluation by qualified healthcare professionals is essential. Start with your eye doctor and physician, and be sure to provide them with as much detail as possible about your symptoms and experiences. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your frustration. It's completely valid to feel this way after years of dealing with epilepsy, especially when you feel like you're not getting the progress or answers you need. Let's break down some potential avenues to explore:\n\n**1. Second Opinion & Specialist Epilepsy Centres:**\n\n*   **The most important recommendation is to seek a second opinion, preferably from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy (an epileptologist) at a Comprehensive Epilepsy Centre.**  Epilepsy centres have more advanced diagnostic and treatment options than a general neurology practice. This is *crucial* because your current neurologist seems to have plateaued in their approach.\n*   **How to find a centre in the UK:** You can ask your GP for a referral to a specialist epilepsy centre. The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (Queen Square) in London is one example of a renowned centre, but there may be others closer to you. The Epilepsy Society is another useful resource. They may be able to signpost centres near you.\n\n**Why a second opinion is vital:**\n\n*   **Re-Evaluation of Diagnosis:** Even though you've had a diagnosis for years, it's essential to re-evaluate. Sometimes initial diagnoses need refining.\n*   **More Advanced Diagnostic Testing:** Specialist centres have access to more sophisticated tests that can sometimes identify the underlying cause of epilepsy. This includes:\n    *   **High-Resolution MRI:** A more detailed MRI of the brain can sometimes reveal subtle structural abnormalities that weren't apparent on previous scans.\n    *   **Video EEG Monitoring:** Continuous EEG monitoring combined with video recording (often in a hospital setting) to capture seizures and identify their origin. This can be longer and more thorough than a standard EEG.\n    *   **Genetic Testing:** As you've had epilepsy since the age of 14 and it is currently uncontrolled, this might be indicated to look for specific genetic mutations associated with epilepsy syndromes.\n*   **Exploring Different Treatment Options:** Epileptologists are more familiar with a wider range of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), combination therapies, and non-pharmacological treatments.\n\n**2. Reviewing Your Current Medication (Lamotrigine):**\n\n*   **Dosage:** Is your current dosage of lamotrigine optimal for your weight and seizure frequency? It may need adjusting. Your neurologist should regularly check blood levels to ensure you are within the therapeutic range.\n*   **Alternative Medications:** Lamotrigine is a common first-line medication for generalised epilepsy. However, if it's not fully controlling your seizures after eight years, exploring alternative medications or adding a second medication is essential. There are many AEDs available, and what works best varies from person to person. Common medications for general seizures include valproate, levetiracetam, and topiramate.\n*   **Potential Interactions:** Make sure your neurologist is aware of *all* other medications you're taking (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements), as well as your alcohol consumption. Some substances can interfere with AED effectiveness.\n\n**3. Lifestyle Factors & Seizure Triggers:**\n\n*   **Sleep:** Poor sleep is a common seizure trigger. Aim for a consistent sleep schedule and good sleep hygiene.\n*   **Stress:** Stress management techniques (meditation, yoga, deep breathing) can be helpful.\n*   **Alcohol:**  You mention you drink. Alcohol can lower the seizure threshold for some people. It is advised to avoid or drink in moderation. Discuss this frankly with your neurologist. They can give you specific guidance based on your individual situation.\n*   **Missed Medication:**  Missing doses of your medication is a very common cause for seizures. Using pillboxes can help.\n\n**4. Non-Pharmacological Treatments:**\n\n*   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** A device implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve, which can reduce seizure frequency in some individuals.\n*   **Neurostimulation:** Other devices like Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) may be an option for people with focal epilepsy (where seizures originate from a specific area of the brain). Although you have generalized epilepsy, exploring these options with a specialist is still worth considering.\n*   **Dietary Therapy:** Although not typically used for generalized epilepsy, some dietary therapies like the ketogenic diet have shown promise in certain epilepsy syndromes.\n\n**5. Addressing Concerns About Travel and Work:**\n\n*   **Travel Insurance:**  Ensure you have appropriate travel insurance that covers pre-existing conditions like epilepsy.\n*   **Medication Abroad:**  Carry your medication in its original packaging, along with a copy of your prescription.\n*   **Epilepsy Action:** The Epilepsy Action website has a lot of information regarding travel with epilepsy.\n*   **Workplace Considerations:** Discuss your epilepsy with your employer, focusing on what they need to know to support you in case of a seizure. Under UK law, employers have a duty to make reasonable adjustments for employees with disabilities.\n\n**6. Psychological Support:**\n\n*   **Counselling or Therapy:** Living with uncontrolled epilepsy can take a toll on your mental health. Consider seeking counselling or therapy to help you cope with the emotional challenges.\n*   **Support Groups:** Connecting with other people who have epilepsy can provide valuable support and understanding. Epilepsy Action and the Epilepsy Society can provide support groups near you.\n\n**Actionable Steps:**\n\n1.  **Make an appointment with your GP and request a referral to a Comprehensive Epilepsy Centre and an epileptologist.** Explain your concerns about your current treatment plan and your desire for a more thorough evaluation.\n2.  **Contact Epilepsy Action or the Epilepsy Society for information and support.**\n3.  **Start tracking your seizures in a seizure diary.** Note down when they occur, potential triggers, and any other relevant information. This information will be helpful for your neurologist.\n4.  **Write down a list of questions and concerns to bring to your next appointment.** Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself.\n5.  **Consider a therapeutic approach.** There are many mental health professionals you can speak to regarding concerns with the burden of your condition.\n\nIt is vital to advocate for yourself. Be insistent in your pursuit of answers and better treatment options. Don't accept a \"we don't know the cause\" response without further investigation. Modern medicine has made significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, and it's your right to access those advances.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *This information is intended for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "22F, 5\u20195, 173lb, whitehi there! weird thing happened last night and i\u2019m nervous and hoping someone might have some input for me. i recently started taking prozac (10mg) in conjunction with lamictal (125mg) (which i\u2019ve been on for about 6 weeks) for MDD. i\u2019ve had a huge decrease in appetite which has led to me forgetting to eat a lot. yesterday i ate very little - almost nothing, without realizing. i was smoking weed with my partner and i started to feel really unwell. i have a low tolerance so i didn\u2019t think much of it. i remember telling him i wanted to lay down, and next thing i knew i woke up to him holding me and saying my name over and over. he asked me a bunch of questions about my surroundings and personal information (address, birthday, etc.) to make sure i was aware and coherent. he said i was sitting there, mentioned i wanted to lay down, and then my body stiffened/seized up and i slid down the chair backwards until i was on the floor and he started trying to wake me up. he said in total, i was out for less than a minute, but he was worried i was having a seizure. while i was out, i was having what felt like a short lucid dream where i was rolling down a mountain, if that\u2019s important. when i came back to my senses, i was sweating a lot, and was nauseous. i laid on the floor for a little bit until i felt okay, and then went to bed. today i feel fine.i figured i just fainted bc i hadn\u2019t eaten and i was smoking, but i know serotonin syndrome can cause seizures so i\u2019m just feeling very anxious and wondering if i\u2019m worrying over nothing. i\u2019ve never fainted or had a seizure so i don\u2019t really know what either one feel like.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is definitely something you should discuss with your doctor as soon as possible. While it could be a simple fainting spell related to low blood sugar and weed, the possibility of a more serious cause, including a drug interaction or even a seizure, needs to be ruled out by a medical professional.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why and what you should do:\n\n**Why You Need to Talk to Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Seizure vs. Fainting (Syncope):** It can be difficult for a layperson (or even a medical professional without witnessing the event) to definitively distinguish between a seizure and a fainting spell based solely on a description. The stiffening/seizing you experienced is more suggestive of a seizure, but it's not conclusive.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Prozac (fluoxetine) and Lamictal (lamotrigine) are both powerful medications that affect the brain. Combining them can sometimes lead to unexpected side effects or interactions. While the combination is commonly used, individual reactions can vary.\n*   **Serotonin Syndrome:** You're right to be concerned about serotonin syndrome. Prozac increases serotonin levels. While less common with low doses, it's a possibility, especially when combined with other factors. Symptoms can include confusion, agitation, muscle rigidity (which *could* be mistaken for seizure-like activity), sweating, nausea, and in severe cases, seizures.\n*   **Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia):** Not eating enough, especially while taking medications that can affect blood sugar levels (some antidepressants *can* affect blood sugar, albeit less commonly than medications specifically for diabetes), can lead to low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia can cause dizziness, weakness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. While low blood sugar can cause fainting, it usually doesn't cause the stiffening/seizing.\n*   **Weed Interaction:** Marijuana can lower blood pressure, which can contribute to fainting. However, it's less likely to cause a seizure-like event on its own, especially in someone who's used it before.\n*   **Underlying Medical Condition:** While less likely, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could have contributed to this episode, especially if you've never had anything like this happen before.\n\n**What You Should Do Now:**\n\n1.  **Call Your Doctor/Psychiatrist TODAY:** Explain what happened in detail. Do not downplay anything, even if you think it might be irrelevant. Specifically mention the stiffening/seizing, your medications (including dosages), the weed use, and the lack of food.\n2.  **Do NOT Drive Until Cleared:** If there's a chance you had a seizure, driving could be dangerous. Your doctor will advise you on when it's safe to drive again.\n3.  **Avoid Alcohol and Recreational Drugs:** Until your doctor has evaluated you, it's best to avoid alcohol and recreational drugs as they could potentially exacerbate the situation or interfere with the evaluation process.\n4.  **Monitor Yourself:** Pay close attention to any other symptoms you experience, such as:\n\n    *   Headaches\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Confusion\n    *   Muscle twitching or stiffness\n    *   Changes in vision\n    *   Any new or worsening anxiety or depression symptoms\n5.  **Eat Regularly:** Make a conscious effort to eat regular, balanced meals, even if you don't feel hungry. This will help stabilize your blood sugar.\n6.  **Consider Keeping a Log:** If you experience any further unusual symptoms, keep a detailed log of when they occur, what you were doing, and how you felt. This information can be helpful for your doctor.\n7. **Inform your partner.** If you feel comfortable, letting your partner know so that they can help monitor you can provide a layer of safety.\n\n**What to Expect from Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Detailed History:** Your doctor will ask you a lot of questions about your medical history, medications, and the episode itself.\n*   **Physical Exam:** A physical exam will help assess your overall health.\n*   **Possible Tests:** Depending on what your doctor suspects, they might order tests such as:\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check your blood sugar, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and levels of your medications.\n    *   **EKG (Electrocardiogram):** To check your heart rhythm.\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To look for abnormal brain activity (if a seizure is suspected).\n    *   **MRI or CT Scan of the Brain:** In some cases, imaging may be needed to rule out any structural problems.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Change Your Medication Dosage on Your Own:** Never stop taking or change the dosage of your medications without talking to your doctor first.\n*   **Be Honest:** Be completely honest with your doctor about your marijuana use. They need to know all the factors that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible this was just a fainting spell, the stiffening/seizing and the potential for medication interactions warrant immediate medical attention. Contact your doctor as soon as possible. Don't delay, as prompt evaluation can help prevent potential complications.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your treatment or care.\n"

    "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, that sounds incredibly frustrating and scary. It's understandable that you're feeling like things have gone downhill. Let's break down the potential contributing factors and discuss what might be happening.  Keep in mind, this is not medical advice, and you should discuss all of this with your neurologist.\n\n**Key Issues and Potential Explanations:**\n\n1.  **Misunderstanding and Dismissal of Myoclonic Seizures:**  This is a critical problem. Myoclonic seizures are *real* seizures. Dismissing them as \"nothing\" or not understanding their significance can lead to inadequate treatment and a worsening of your overall seizure control. The fact that you experienced a tonic-clonic seizure after stopping medication, despite experiencing myoclonic jerks, strongly suggests that your epilepsy was never fully controlled, even though you were seizure free. \n\n2.  **Stopping Medication Too Soon:**  The criteria for stopping anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) usually involves being seizure-free for a longer period than three years, with some neurologists recommending five or even longer. A clear EEG is good, but not a guarantee. The fact that the seizures returned soon after stopping the medication suggests that your seizure threshold was still low.\n\n3.  **Inadequate Medication Transition:**  This is a huge red flag!  Switching from Keppra to Lamotrigine (or any AED) needs to be done *gradually* and with careful monitoring.  Lamotrigine requires a very slow titration (increasing the dose gradually) to avoid serious side effects (like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome).  Suddenly stopping Keppra and starting a very low dose of Lamotrigine is almost guaranteed to cause breakthrough seizures. This is likely the most significant factor in your current situation.  This process would have needed much more planning and oversight by a knowledgeable neurologist. This could explain why you've been feeling worse ever since this happened.\n\n4.  **Incorrect Dosage and Combination:** You stated you were fine on 500mg Keppra/day. The neurologist has prescribed Lamotrigine at a very low dose (25mg) and 250mg of Keppra twice a day. It sounds like they are trying to titrate you on the Lamotrigine and hope that it works as you wean off of Keppra again. However, you need to do this very, very slowly. \n\n5.  **Sleep Deprivation and Seizures:**  You mention that sleep deprivation triggers your myoclonic seizures.  This is very common in epilepsy. Poor sleep can lower your seizure threshold, making seizures more likely. Ensuring consistent sleep habits is crucial.\n\n6. **Clobazam:** Is a benzodiazepine and is usually not a first-line treatment for epilepsy as it carries a risk of dependence and tolerance. It is often used as a rescue medication or as an add-on therapy for difficult-to-control seizures, particularly myoclonic seizures. The fact that you need to take Clobazam regularly indicates that your other medications are not adequately controlling your seizures.\n\n**Why Things Have Gone Downhill:**\n\nThe most likely reason everything has gotten worse is the poorly managed medication transition. Suddenly stopping Keppra and starting a very low dose of Lamotrigine disrupted your seizure control and may have made your epilepsy more difficult to manage. It's possible that this transition has altered the sensitivity of your brain to seizure activity, leading to increased myoclonic seizures.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Find a New Neurologist ASAP:**  You need a neurologist who:\n    *   Is experienced in treating epilepsy, especially myoclonic seizures.\n    *   Listens to your concerns and takes your experiences seriously.\n    *   Understands the importance of careful medication management.\n    *   Is willing to work with you to find the best treatment plan.\n\n2.  **Schedule a Comprehensive Appointment:** Bring a detailed seizure diary (if you have one). Be prepared to describe your myoclonic seizures very precisely (frequency, duration, triggers, etc.).\n\n3.  **Medication Review:** Discuss your current medications, the previous transition, and your concerns about the dosages. You may need a slow and carefully monitored titration of Lamotrigine (or another AED) to regain seizure control. Your neurologist might consider increasing your Keppra dosage again, given your previous success.\n\n4.  **EEG and Possibly MRI:**  Ask about repeating an EEG (Electroencephalogram) to assess your brain activity. An MRI of your brain may also be recommended to rule out any structural abnormalities that could be contributing to your seizures.\n\n5.  **Sleep Hygiene:**  Prioritize consistent sleep habits:\n    *   Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n    *   Create a relaxing bedtime routine (e.g., warm bath, reading).\n    *   Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n    *   Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n\n6.  **Seizure Diary:** Keep a detailed record of your seizures: date, time, duration, symptoms, potential triggers (sleep deprivation, stress, etc.), and any medications taken.\n\n7.  **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to question your neurologist, ask for clarification, and seek a second opinion if you're not comfortable with the treatment plan.\n\n8.  **Consider Support Groups:**  Connecting with other people who have epilepsy can provide valuable emotional support and practical advice.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome:** Be aware of the signs of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) when taking Lamotrigine (rash, fever, blisters). Report any skin changes to your doctor immediately.\n*   **Pregnancy:** If you are considering becoming pregnant, talk to your neurologist. Some AEDs can increase the risk of birth defects.\n*   **Driving:** Discuss with your neurologist when it will be safe for you to drive again.\n\nIt's completely valid to feel overwhelmed and frustrated by this situation. It sounds like you haven't been given the care and attention you deserve. Take these steps to find a neurologist who can provide you with the right treatment and support. With proper management, you can regain control of your seizures and improve your quality of life. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling shaken up and have so many questions after experiencing a seizure, especially when the cause isn't immediately clear. It sounds like you're taking all the right steps in following up with medical professionals and taking precautions. Let's address your questions:\n\n**1. How common is it to have a seizure with no apparent underlying cause?**\n\nIt's more common than you might think to have a single seizure, or even a few, without a clear diagnosis of epilepsy. This is referred to as an **unprovoked seizure**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Isolated Seizures:** It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will experience a seizure at some point in their life. Many of these are isolated events.\n*   **Causes of Unprovoked Seizures:** Even with testing, the exact cause for an unprovoked seizure can remain undetermined. Potential, but not always identifiable, causes can include:\n\n    *   **Sleep deprivation:** A major trigger for many people, especially in young adults.\n    *   **Stress:** Significant emotional or physical stress can sometimes trigger a seizure.\n    *   **Hormonal changes:** Fluctuations in hormones, especially in women, can play a role.\n    *   **Electrolyte imbalances:** While your blood tests were normal, subtle imbalances that have since corrected themselves could have been a factor.\n    *   **Infections:** Some viral or bacterial infections can temporarily lower the seizure threshold.\n    *   **Medications:** Wellbutrin is known to lower the seizure threshold, and decreasing the dosage can help. Other medications can also contribute.\n    *   **Substance use/withdrawal:** If relevant, this is something to consider, though it may not be applicable to you.\n    *   **Head trauma (even mild):** A bump to the head that you might not even remember could sometimes be a factor.\n    *   **Underlying, undetected brain condition:** This is why the MRI is so important. It will help rule out structural abnormalities that might not be visible on a CT scan (e.g., small lesions, vascular malformations).\n\n*   **Epilepsy Risk After One Seizure:** Having one unprovoked seizure doesn't automatically mean you have epilepsy. However, it does increase your risk of having another. Studies suggest the risk of having a second seizure within the next 2 years after a first unprovoked seizure is around 21-45%. Your neurologist will be able to discuss your individual risk based on your medical history, exam, and test results.\n\n**2. Should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine?**\n\nThis is a very reasonable and important question. Here's what to consider:\n\n*   **Talk to Your Doctor:** The *most* important thing is to discuss this directly with your doctor and neurologist. They know your specific case best and can give you personalized recommendations.\n*   **Driving Restriction:** You've already been advised to avoid driving, which is standard after a seizure.\n*   **Activities with Risk of Injury:** Activities where a loss of consciousness could lead to significant injury should be approached with caution. This includes:\n    *   **Dancing:** The risk depends on the type of dancing. High-impact or acrobatic dancing carries a greater risk than slow, gentle movement.\n    *   **Sewing Machine:** While not inherently dangerous, a seizure while using a sewing machine could lead to cuts or other injuries.\n    *   **Swimming, Bathing Alone:** Avoid these until cleared by your doctor.\n    *   **Heights, Ladders:** Obviously, avoid any activities involving heights.\n*   **General Precautions:**\n    *   **Start Slowly:** When you do resume activities, start slowly and in a safe environment.\n    *   **Have Someone with You:** If possible, have someone nearby when you engage in higher-risk activities, at least initially. This is especially important if you start to feel unwell.\n    *   **Avoid Known Triggers:** If you can identify any potential triggers (e.g., sleep deprivation, stress), try to avoid them.\n*   **Return to Normalcy:** The goal is to eventually return to a normal life as much as possible. But taking reasonable precautions in the short term is wise.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **The MRI is crucial:** It will provide more detailed information about your brain structure.\n*   **Consult with your neurologist:** They will be your primary source of information and guidance. They can help you understand your risk of future seizures, potential treatment options, and safe activity levels.\n*   **Be patient:** It may take time to determine the cause of your seizure and develop a long-term plan.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Aura:** In retrospect, think about if you felt anything unusual *before* the seizure. Some people experience an \"aura\" \u2013 a strange sensation, smell, taste, or feeling \u2013 that precedes the seizure.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Make sure your neurologist is aware of all medications and supplements you take.\n*   **Lifestyle Factors:** Maintain a regular sleep schedule, manage stress, and avoid excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nIt's commendable that you're being proactive and thoughtful about your health. Don't hesitate to ask your doctors any and all questions you have. Their expertise will provide you with the most accurate and personalized advice. I hope you get some answers and feel more confident moving forward.\n"

    "question": "Hello, I am 24 and I was diagnosed with epilepsy around 2 years ago, and prior to this I thought epilepsy was 1) you were born with it, and 2) it was caused due to flashing lights. My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had. I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable why you're seeking more information. What you've described is a very common experience, and many people with epilepsy share your feelings of confusion and uncertainty, especially when their seizures seem to come out of nowhere. Let's break down what's happening and what might be useful to explore:\n\n**1. Acquired Epilepsy Later in Life:**\n\n*   **Not Always Congenital:** While some people are born with genetic predispositions to epilepsy, many others develop it later in life. In fact, a significant portion of epilepsy diagnoses occur in adulthood.\n*   **Many Possible Causes:** There are numerous potential causes of acquired epilepsy, including:\n    *   **Brain Injury:** Even mild head trauma that you may not remember can sometimes contribute.\n    *   **Stroke or TIA:** Especially in older adults, but possible at any age.\n    *   **Brain Tumors:** These are less common but should be ruled out.\n    *   **Infections:** Meningitis, encephalitis, or other brain infections.\n    *   **Autoimmune Diseases:** Some autoimmune conditions can affect the brain.\n    *   **Vascular Malformations:** Abnormal blood vessels in the brain.\n    *   **Unknown (Idiopathic):** In many cases, even with extensive testing, the underlying cause remains unknown. This is called idiopathic epilepsy, and it's very common.\n\n**2. \"Seemingly Random\" Seizures:**\n\n*   **Triggers Can Be Subtle:** It's important to understand that triggers aren't always obvious or immediate. They can be cumulative or delayed. Things like:\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Even a few hours of missed sleep can increase seizure risk.\n    *   **Stress:** Emotional or physical stress.\n    *   **Hormonal Changes:** (More common in women, but still possible)\n    *   **Illness:** Even a mild cold.\n    *   **Medication Changes:** Including starting or stopping other medications or supplements.\n    *   **Dehydration:**\n    *   **Diet:** Some people find certain foods or additives to be triggers (though this is often anecdotal).\n*   **Subthreshold Activity:** Your brain may be closer to a seizure threshold at certain times, making it more susceptible to spontaneous activity.\n*   **Not Everything Is Triggered:** Sometimes, seizures truly do seem to occur randomly. This doesn't mean there *isn't* an underlying cause, just that you haven't identified it yet.\n\n**3. Photosensitivity and Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Not the Only Type:** Photosensitive epilepsy (where flashing lights trigger seizures) is a specific type of epilepsy, and it's relatively uncommon. The vast majority of people with epilepsy are not photosensitive.\n*   **Testing Is Available:** Your doctor may have already done a test for photosensitivity as part of your EEG.\n\n**What You Can Do Now:**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Neurologist:** The most important step is to have an open and detailed conversation with your neurologist. Here are some questions you might want to ask:\n    *   \"What type of epilepsy do I have?\"\n    *   \"What do we know (or not know) about the cause of my epilepsy?\"\n    *   \"What further tests might be helpful?\"\n    *   \"What are the potential side effects of my medication?\"\n    *   \"Are there any lifestyle modifications I should consider?\"\n    *   \"What is the plan for adjusting my medication if my seizures are not well-controlled?\"\n    *   \"What are my long-term prospects?\"\n    *   \"Can you recommend any epilepsy support groups?\"\n2.  **Keep a Seizure Diary:** Start tracking your seizures, including the date, time, any potential triggers you can identify (even seemingly small ones), how you felt before and after, your sleep patterns, and anything else that seems relevant. This information can be invaluable for your neurologist.\n3.  **Medication Adherence:** It is extremely important to take your medication exactly as prescribed. Do not miss doses or change the timing without talking to your neurologist. If you're experiencing side effects, discuss them with your doctor. There may be alternative medications.\n4.  **Lifestyle Modifications:** Focus on good sleep hygiene, stress management techniques (exercise, meditation, deep breathing), a healthy diet, and staying hydrated.\n5.  **Educate Yourself:** Learn as much as you can about epilepsy from reputable sources (Epilepsy Action or Epilepsy Society in the UK, for example). Understanding the condition can help you feel more empowered.\n6. **Consider wearing some sort of medical ID.** This will help people assist you correctly if you ever have a seizure in public.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** Discuss driving restrictions with your neurologist. Regulations vary, but there's usually a seizure-free period required before you can drive.\n*   **Alcohol:** Discuss alcohol consumption with your neurologist. It can interact with medications and potentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\n**In summary, it's normal to feel confused and frustrated when your seizures seem random. By working closely with your neurologist, keeping a detailed seizure diary, and focusing on healthy lifestyle habits, you can gain better control over your epilepsy and improve your quality of life.**\n"

    "question": "I am not a doctor, but I know my body and I am no fool. I also try to avoid going to the doctor unless necessary, so I try to make sure I have to go before I do. My doctors tend to mark me up to either being a hypochondriac or having drug seeking behaviour.For example: I have very severe epilepsy, and the Keppra I am on is no longer working; I am having multiple seizures in a row every month along with, almost constant myoclonic jerks in my legs. I asked my doctor to please change me from the Keppra about 6 months ago, when it first started showing signs of no longer working. Last month I had 9 focal-to-generalized seizures without becoming aware between them.In short, pharmaceutical companies tell me to ask my doctor about certain meds, but when I do, they blow me off.Bonus Question: What do you recommend for these seizures? They are almost always triggered by hormones, stress level, and being asleep.Thanks in advance!",

    "answer": "It sounds incredibly frustrating to be dealing with worsening seizures, especially when you feel like your concerns aren't being taken seriously by your doctors.  It's understandable that you'd want to be proactive about your health and research potential solutions.\n\n**Addressing the Issue of Being Dismissed**\n\nThis is a serious problem, and it's important to find a way to communicate effectively with your healthcare providers. Here's a breakdown of things to consider:\n\n1.  **Documentation is Key:**\n\n    *   **Seizure Diary:**  Keep a detailed record of every seizure (or suspected seizure) you experience. Note the date, time, duration, specific symptoms (including the myoclonic jerks), potential triggers (stress, sleep patterns, hormonal cycle timing), and any medications you took that day.  A digital seizure diary app can be very helpful.\n    *   **Medication Log:** Track all medications you're taking, including dosages and times.  Note any side effects you're experiencing.\n    *   **Other Relevant Symptoms:**  Document any other symptoms that might be related, such as changes in mood, sleep disturbances, or cognitive difficulties.\n\n2.  **Preparation for Appointments:**\n\n    *   **Written List of Concerns:**  Before each appointment, write down a concise list of your most pressing concerns.  Prioritize them.\n    *   **Bring Your Seizure Diary:**  Present this to your doctor at the beginning of the appointment.  This provides concrete evidence.\n    *   **Specific Questions:**  Formulate specific questions about medication changes, alternative treatments, or further testing. For example, instead of saying \"I want off Keppra,\" say \"Keppra is no longer controlling my seizures. My seizure diary shows an increase in focal-to-generalized seizures over the past six months. What are the alternative medications we can consider, and what are their potential side effects?\"\n    *   **Explain Your Research:**  If you've researched a medication, briefly explain your understanding of it and why you think it might be appropriate for you.  Frame it as a question: \"I've been reading about [medication name] and it seems like it might be helpful for hormone-related seizures.  Is this something we could explore?\"  Avoid sounding demanding; instead, aim for a collaborative tone.\n\n3.  **Advocacy:**\n\n    *   **Bring a Support Person:**  If possible, bring a trusted friend or family member to your appointments.  They can take notes, ask questions you might forget, and provide emotional support.  Their presence can also help reinforce the seriousness of your concerns.\n    *   **Seek a Second Opinion:**  If you consistently feel dismissed, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another neurologist.  Explain your history and your concerns about being labeled as a hypochondriac or drug-seeker.\n    *   **Consider a Different Practice:**  Sometimes, the environment of a particular clinic can contribute to the problem.  Consider switching to a different neurology practice or hospital system.\n\n4.  **Communication Style:**\n\n    *   **Remain Calm and Respectful:**  Even when frustrated, try to remain calm and respectful.  Express your concerns clearly and assertively, but avoid being confrontational.\n    *   **Focus on Facts:**  Base your arguments on the documented evidence in your seizure diary and your understanding of your own body.\n    *   **Emphasize Quality of Life:**  Explain how the seizures are impacting your daily life, your ability to work, your relationships, and your overall well-being.\n\n5.  **Addressing Concerns About Drug-Seeking Behavior:**\n\n    *   **Be Open and Honest:** Acknowledge the doctor's concerns directly. State that your primary goal is to control your seizures and improve your quality of life, and that you are willing to work collaboratively with them to find the best treatment plan.\n    *   **Focus on Non-Narcotic Options:** Emphasize your interest in exploring non-narcotic medications and therapies.\n    *   **Agree to Monitoring:** Be willing to agree to regular monitoring and drug screenings if the doctor deems it necessary.\n\n**Specific Recommendations for Seizure Control (Important Disclaimer!)**\n\nI *cannot* provide specific medical advice, and I strongly urge you to discuss these options thoroughly with your neurologist. However, here are some things that are *often* considered when Keppra is no longer effective:\n\n*   **Switching Medications:** There are many other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) available. Common alternatives to Keppra include:\n    *   Lamotrigine (Lamictal)\n    *   Zonisamide (Zonegran)\n    *   Topiramate (Topamax)\n    *   Levetiracetam (Keppra XR) - An extended-release version of Keppra may provide more consistent blood levels.\n    *   Brivaracetam (Briviact) - This is a newer AED that is similar to Keppra but may have fewer side effects for some people.\n    *   Lacosamide (Vimpat)\n    *   Carbamazepine (Tegretol) and Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)\n    *   Valproic Acid (Depakote)\n    *   Phenytoin (Dilantin) and Fosphenytoin (Cerebyx)\n    *   Ethosuximide (Zarontin)\n    The choice of medication depends on the type of seizures you have, your age, other medical conditions, and potential side effects.\n*   **Adding a Second Medication:** Sometimes, a combination of two AEDs is more effective than a single medication.\n*   **Hormonal Triggers:** Since your seizures are hormone-related, discuss these options with your doctor:\n    *   **Hormone Therapy:** If the seizures are linked to your menstrual cycle (catamenial epilepsy), hormone therapy (such as progesterone or birth control pills) might be an option. This needs careful evaluation and management by a gynecologist and neurologist working together.\n*   **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n    *   **Sleep Hygiene:** Maintain a regular sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and ensure a dark, quiet sleep environment.\n*   **Other Therapies:**\n    *   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** A device implanted in the chest that stimulates the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):** A device implanted in the brain that detects seizure activity and delivers electrical stimulation to stop the seizure.\n    *   **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):** A surgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes in specific areas of the brain.\n*   **Dietary Therapy:**\n    *   **Ketogenic Diet:** A high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet that can help control seizures in some people. It requires strict medical supervision.\n*   **Surgery:**\n    *   **Resective Surgery:** If the seizures originate from a specific area of the brain, surgery to remove that area might be an option.\n    *   **Laser Ablation:** A minimally invasive procedure that uses laser energy to destroy the seizure focus.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Never stop taking your medication abruptly.** This can lead to increased seizure frequency or even status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition.\n*   **Any change in medication should be done under the guidance of your neurologist.** They will need to gradually taper you off the old medication and start you on the new one.\n*   **Be patient.** It can take time to find the right medication or combination of medications to control your seizures.\n\nI know this is a lot of information, but I hope it gives you some direction and empowers you to advocate for yourself with your doctors.  Good luck, and please seek professional medical advice.\n"

    "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're scared and unsure what to do. You're balancing his wishes, his family's advice, and your own gut feeling that something is wrong. Here's a breakdown of things to consider and potential actions you can take:\n\n**1. Prioritize His Safety and Well-being:**\n\n*   **Multiple Grand Mal Seizures in a Short Period is Concerning:**  The fact that he's had four grand mal seizures today, after a period of relative stability, is a significant change and warrants serious attention.  While his family may be used to this, it doesn't make it less dangerous.  Multiple seizures in a short period (status epilepticus) can lead to brain damage, aspiration pneumonia (from inhaling vomit), and other complications.\n*   **His Aversion to Medication is Part of the Problem:**  The fact that he's refusing medication is a major concern.  His seizures are likely uncontrolled or worsening because of it. His behavior (being a \"jerk\") could also be a symptom of the seizures themselves or the post-ictal state (the period after a seizure).\n\n**2.  Weigh the Risks and Benefits of Calling an Ambulance:**\n\n*   **License vs. Life/Brain Damage:** The fear of losing his license is valid, but it pales in comparison to the potential for serious harm from uncontrolled seizures. You need to consider whether keeping his license is worth risking his health and potentially his life.\n*   **\"Sometimes\" Doesn't Mean \"Safe\":** Just because his family says this \"happens sometimes\" doesn't mean it's acceptable or that there isn't a medical reason for the increase in seizure activity. They may be trying to normalize a situation that is not normal.\n*   **Emergency Medical Professionals Can Assess and Stabilize:**  Paramedics and doctors can assess his condition, administer medications to stop the seizures (if they are ongoing), and determine if there are any underlying causes for the increased frequency.\n*   **Document Everything:** Start documenting the seizures: time, duration, what happened during the seizure, and his behavior before and after. This will be crucial information if you do need to seek medical help.\n\n**3. Consider These Options (In Order of Urgency and Potential Impact):**\n\n*   **A. If he has another seizure soon, especially if it's prolonged (longer than 5 minutes) or one right after another:** **CALL AN AMBULANCE IMMEDIATELY.**  Don't hesitate.  His life is at risk.  Explain to the paramedics what has been happening, including the frequency of seizures and his resistance to medication.\n*   **B. If he's in a brief period of lucidity (alertness) and able to understand:**\n    *   **Gently but Firmly Explain Your Concerns:** Tell him you're worried about him, that you love him, and that the number of seizures in such a short time is frightening. Try to reason with him about taking his medication.\n    *   **Try to Understand His Resistance:** Why is he refusing his medication? Is he feeling side effects? Is he in denial about his condition? Understanding his reasoning might help you find a compromise.\n    *   **Suggest a Compromise: Telehealth/Doctor's Appointment:** If he's extremely resistant to the ER, could you convince him to do a telehealth appointment with his neurologist or primary care doctor as soon as possible? Or schedule an urgent appointment for tomorrow? This would allow a medical professional to assess the situation and advise on the next steps.\n*   **C. If calling the ambulance/ER is absolutely out of the question for now, and he is not in immediate danger (not seizing currently, breathing okay, and somewhat responsive):**\n    *   **Contact His Neurologist Directly:** Call his neurologist's office and explain the situation. Even if you can't get him to agree to go to the ER, the neurologist might be able to offer guidance over the phone or prescribe a rescue medication (like a nasal spray or rectal suppository) that you can administer at home if he has another seizure.  You'll likely need to explain that you are his partner and are concerned for his well-being.  Having the documentation of the seizures will be helpful here.\n    *   **Talk to a Medical Professional Without Him Knowing (Initially):** Contact a trusted doctor, nurse, or pharmacist and explain the situation (without revealing private information). They can offer advice on how to approach the situation and what signs to look for that would necessitate immediate medical intervention.\n*   **D. Long-Term Strategies:**\n    *   **Educate Yourself:** Learn as much as you can about his specific type of epilepsy, his medications, and what to do during and after a seizure. This will empower you to be a better caregiver and advocate for him. The Epilepsy Foundation website (epilepsy.com) is a good resource.\n    *   **Talk to a Therapist (For Yourself):**  This is a very stressful situation, and you deserve support. A therapist can help you process your feelings, develop coping strategies, and navigate the challenges of being a caregiver.\n    *   **Consider Attending His Neurologist Appointments (With His Permission):**  If he's willing, attend his appointments with him. This will allow you to ask questions, understand his treatment plan, and be more involved in his care.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Legality:**  While you want to respect his wishes, you also have a moral and potentially legal obligation to act in his best interest if he is unable to make rational decisions due to his seizures. If you believe he is a danger to himself, you have a right to seek medical help for him.\n*   **Your Well-being Matters:** You can't effectively care for him if you're running on empty. Make sure you're taking care of your own physical and mental health.\n*   **His Family's Perspective:** While you should listen to his family's input, remember that you are his primary caregiver now. You have a different perspective, and your concerns are valid. Don't be afraid to challenge their advice if you believe it's not in his best interest.\n*   **Communicate with His Family:** If possible, try to have an open and honest conversation with his family about your concerns. Explain why you're worried and why you believe he needs medical attention. Try to work together to find a solution that everyone can agree on.\n\n**In summary, prioritize his safety. The increase in seizures is a serious concern. Don't let the fear of him losing his license outweigh the risk of serious harm.  Call for help if he has another seizure, especially if it's prolonged or one right after another.  If not, try to convince him to see a doctor or contact his neurologist immediately.**\n\nThis is a difficult situation, but you're doing the right thing by seeking advice. Trust your instincts, advocate for his health, and remember that you're not alone. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the relationship between anxiety/stress and seizures, especially in a 17-year-old male.\n\n**The Short Answer:**\n\nWhile anxiety and stress can *trigger* seizures in someone who is already predisposed to them (i.e., has epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold), they are **extremely unlikely** to *cause* epilepsy or seizures in someone who has never had them before and has no underlying neurological condition.\n\n**The Longer Explanation:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. This means the seizures happen spontaneously, without a clear, immediate trigger. It's usually due to an underlying problem in the brain's electrical activity.\n\n*   **Seizures:** A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain.  There are many different types of seizures, and they can manifest in various ways (e.g., convulsions, staring spells, loss of awareness).\n\n*   **Anxiety, Stress, and the Brain:**  Anxiety and stress can significantly impact brain function. They can lead to:\n    *   Increased excitability of neurons.\n    *   Changes in neurotransmitter levels (e.g., cortisol, adrenaline).\n    *   Sleep deprivation, which can lower the seizure threshold.\n    *   Hyperventilation (rapid breathing), which can alter blood pH and potentially trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.\n\n*   **How Anxiety/Stress Can Trigger Seizures (in those who are prone):**\n    *   **Lowered Seizure Threshold:**  Imagine a threshold that needs to be crossed for a seizure to occur.  People with epilepsy or other neurological vulnerabilities have a lower threshold.  Anxiety and stress can further lower that threshold, making a seizure more likely to happen.\n    *   **Specific Triggers:**  For some individuals with epilepsy, stress is a known and consistent trigger. They might notice that seizures are more frequent during periods of high anxiety or stress.\n    *   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These seizures look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are a manifestation of psychological distress, often related to anxiety, trauma, or other mental health conditions.  While they are not epilepsy, they are a serious condition that requires appropriate diagnosis and treatment (usually psychological therapy).\n\n*   **Why It's Unlikely to *Cause* Epilepsy:**\n    *   Epilepsy usually involves a more fundamental underlying brain abnormality (e.g., genetic factors, brain injury, structural brain differences).\n    *   While extreme stress *could* theoretically contribute to some forms of acquired epilepsy in very rare circumstances (e.g., by causing prolonged oxygen deprivation to the brain), this is exceptionally uncommon.\n\n**Important Considerations for a 17-Year-Old Male:**\n\n*   **First-Time Seizure:** If you have experienced a seizure for the first time, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention. A doctor needs to rule out other possible causes and determine if it was truly a seizure.\n*   **Underlying Conditions:**  A thorough medical evaluation, including neurological examination and possibly an EEG (electroencephalogram), is crucial to determine if there is any underlying neurological condition that might be contributing.\n*   **Mental Health:**  Address anxiety and stress directly.  Therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) and stress-reduction techniques (e.g., mindfulness, exercise) can be very helpful, regardless of whether or not they are related to seizures.\n*   **Lifestyle Factors:**  Ensure adequate sleep, a healthy diet, and avoid excessive alcohol or drug use, as these can also contribute to seizures in susceptible individuals.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhile anxiety and stress are unlikely to *cause* epilepsy in someone with a previously healthy brain, they *can* trigger seizures in individuals who are already prone to them. If you are experiencing seizures, it is essential to seek medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment. Addressing anxiety and stress is also crucial for overall health and well-being.\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. A doctor can properly diagnose and treat any medical conditions."

    "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your daughter's complex medical history, the constellation of symptoms she's experiencing is concerning and requires a thorough investigation by her medical team. The new onset and worsening of abdominal pain, weight loss, decreased appetite, globus sensation (lump in throat), and recent episodes of dizziness/lightheadedness with fainting warrant prompt attention.\n\nHere are some possibilities to consider, given the information you've provided:\n\n**1. Gastrointestinal Issues:**\n\n*   **Partial Bowel Obstruction:** While her bowel issues are known, a partial obstruction could be developing due to adhesions, strictures, or volvulus (twisting). The dilated colon with redundancies increases the risk. The abdominal pain (especially worsened by eating and activity), constipation (even with laxatives), and feeling full/unable to eat are all red flags.\n*   **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):**  Given the bowel issues and chronic constipation, SIBO could be contributing. This can cause abdominal pain, bloating, malabsorption, and weight loss. A breath test can help diagnose this.\n*   **Gastroparesis:**  Delayed gastric emptying can cause nausea, vomiting (although she doesn't have this), early satiety, abdominal pain, and weight loss.  It might be triggered by the medications, or underlying autonomic dysfunction.\n*   **Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome:**  This is a rare condition where the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) is compressed between the aorta and the SMA. Weight loss can decrease the fat pad that protects the duodenum, worsening the compression. This causes post-prandial (after eating) abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and early satiety.  She is at high risk due to her low weight.\n*   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):** Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis could present with abdominal pain, weight loss, and decreased appetite. While bloodwork was negative, it's important to consider especially with worsening symptoms.\n\n**2. Medication-Related Issues:**\n\n*   **Side Effects:** Review all medications (including vitamins/supplements) with her doctor and pharmacist. Some medications can cause abdominal pain, decreased appetite, or dizziness.\n*   **Interactions:** Consider potential interactions between medications.\n*   **Dosage Adjustment:** Lamictal and Keppra dosages may need adjusting in response to changes in her body. Additionally, her bowel regimen medication dosages might need adjusting as well.\n\n**3. Neurological Issues:**\n\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Her history of neurogenic bladder/bowel, temperature regulation issues, and anhidrosis suggests possible autonomic dysfunction. This can affect gastrointestinal motility, blood pressure regulation, and cause dizziness/lightheadedness (orthostatic hypotension).\n*   **Epilepsy and Abdominal Pain:** While less common, some types of seizures can manifest as abdominal pain or discomfort. The stabbing/throbbing quality of the pain is less typical of seizures, but it's worth considering.\n*   **Neuropathy:** The location of her abdominal pain in relation to her belly button could indicate nerve involvement. It's essential to differentiate this from other sources of pain through appropriate testing and evaluations.\n\n**4. Psychological Factors:**\n\n*   **Anxiety:** Anxiety can exacerbate physical symptoms. It's important to ensure her anxiety is well-managed.\n*   **Eating Disorder:** While not specifically mentioned, the weight loss and decreased appetite raise the possibility of an eating disorder, especially given her age. The lump in her throat feeling could also point to underlying anxiety or an eating disorder.\n\n**5. Other possibilities:**\n\n*   **Porphyria:** Acute intermittent porphyria can present with severe abdominal pain and neurological symptoms. While rare, it should be considered if other causes are ruled out.\n*   **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):** This is a condition where mast cells release mediators that cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain. Given her multiple diagnoses and sensitive response to stimuli, this should be considered.\n*   **Adrenal Insufficiency:** This is when the adrenal glands don't produce enough cortisol. Symptoms can include fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, dizziness, and weight loss. This is something to consider given her other medical issues.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Schedule an Urgent Appointment:** She needs to be evaluated by her pediatrician or a pediatric gastroenterologist ASAP. Her symptoms are worsening and causing significant distress.\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Pain/Food Diary:** Track the timing, location, intensity, and character of her pain, as well as everything she eats/drinks. Note any triggering activities or alleviating factors.\n3.  **Consider Specialized Testing:** Discuss the following tests with her doctor:\n    *   **Abdominal Imaging:** CT scan or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis to rule out bowel obstruction or other structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Upper Endoscopy and Colonoscopy:** To visualize the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon and obtain biopsies if needed.\n    *   **Gastric Emptying Study:** To assess for gastroparesis.\n    *   **Small Bowel Follow-Through:** To evaluate the small intestine for abnormalities.\n    *   **Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Doppler Ultrasound/Angiogram:** To rule out SMA syndrome, if suspected.\n    *   **SIBO Breath Test:** To assess for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.\n    *   **Autonomic Testing:** To evaluate for autonomic dysfunction.\n    *   **Porphyria Testing:** If other causes are ruled out.\n    *   **Mast Cell Activation Testing:** If other causes are ruled out.\n4.  **Medication Review:** A thorough medication review is essential to identify potential side effects or interactions.\n5.  **Nutritional Support:** Consider a referral to a registered dietitian to address her weight loss and nutritional deficiencies. They can help with strategies to improve her appetite and tolerance of food.\n6.  **Mental Health Support:** Continue to address her anxiety and consider therapy if needed.\n7.  **Advocate for Her:** As her parent, you are her best advocate. Continue to communicate your concerns to her medical team and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel her needs are not being met.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Given her history of epilepsy, dizziness with falling is a concern. Rule out seizures and consider an EEG if there is any question.\n*   The low Vitamin D level should be addressed with appropriate supplementation.\n\nThis is a complex situation, and it will likely require a multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterology, neurology, and possibly other specialists.

    "question": "Not sure if this is allowed- (20F/medical MJ patient/white) I've been trying to get this figured out for YEARS now, no one takes me seriously. Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",

    "answer": "I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. It is crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\nIt's understandable that you're frustrated with not getting answers after experiencing these episodes for years. Your detailed description of the deja vu, nausea, head tingling/pressure, location of pressure, duration, frequency, and your tracking of the events is very helpful information for a doctor.\n\nHere's why your symptoms raise suspicion for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and why you should continue pursuing a diagnosis:\n\n*   **Deja Vu:** Deja vu is a very common symptom of TLE. It's not just a feeling of familiarity, but a strong, unsettling sense that you've experienced something before, often with a vivid and detailed recall.\n*   **Nausea:** This is another symptom that can be associated with seizures, especially those originating in the temporal lobe.\n*   **Head Tingling/Pressure:** Sensory auras (tingling, numbness, pressure sensations) are common in focal seizures, including TLE. The location of the pressure in the occipital lobe and temples is also relevant.\n*   **Episodic Nature:** The pattern of having these episodes in clusters followed by periods of remission is also consistent with seizure activity.\n*   **Short Duration:** The short duration (less than 10 minutes) is typical of many types of seizures.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1.  **Find a Neurologist, Preferably an Epileptologist:** General neurologists can be helpful, but an epileptologist specializes in epilepsy and is more likely to recognize subtle seizure symptoms.\n2.  **Present Your Logs:** Your detailed logs are incredibly valuable. Show them to the neurologist. Be as specific as possible about what you experience *during* an episode.\n3.  **Request an EEG (Electroencephalogram):** An EEG measures brainwave activity. It's used to identify abnormal brainwave patterns associated with seizures. If your EEG is normal, but your doctor still suspects temporal lobe epilepsy, they may perform an ambulatory EEG, which can last multiple days, or even weeks. Some EEG machines are capable of being synced with video cameras so medical staff can get a visual idea of what is occurring during an event.\n\nIt's essential to advocate for yourself and insist on further investigation, especially given the chronic nature of your symptoms.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** It's important to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as migraines, anxiety disorders, or other neurological conditions.\n*   **Impact on Life:** Even if the episodes are short, they can significantly impact your quality of life. Don't downplay the severity of how they affect you.\n\nKeep searching for the right doctor who will listen to you and take your concerns seriously.\n"

    "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation, and it's understandable you're feeling frustrated and seeking information.  It sounds like you're doing the right things by getting various specialists involved and undergoing testing. Let's break down the symptoms and potential connections, keeping in mind that *I am not a medical professional* and this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. This is intended to help you organize your thoughts and potentially formulate more specific questions for your doctors.\n\n**Key Concerns and Potential Connections:**\n\n*   **Seizures/Movement Disorder Episodes:** This is the most concerning and needs to be thoroughly investigated. The differing opinions on diagnosis (chorea, focal aware seizures, tardive dyskinesia) are important.\n    *   *Possible Causes:*\n        *   **Epilepsy:**  Even though the EEG was normal, it doesn't rule out epilepsy.  EEGs can be normal between seizures. You may want to ask about prolonged EEG monitoring or ambulatory EEG.\n        *   **Autoimmune Disorders (like Lupus):** Some autoimmune disorders can affect the brain and cause neurological symptoms, including seizures or movement disorders.\n        *   **Medication Side Effects:**  While you've been on Wellbutrin & Cymbalta for a while, drug-induced movement disorders or seizures can sometimes develop after prolonged use.  Discuss this possibility thoroughly with your psychiatrist. Cymbalta withdrawal can also cause similar symptoms to what you are describing.\n        *   **Rare Conditions:** There are rarer neurological conditions that could present with these symptoms. It's important to have a neurologist thoroughly investigate.\n        *   **Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Disorder):** This is a diagnosis of exclusion and should only be considered after other potential medical causes have been ruled out. It involves neurological symptoms (like seizures or movement problems) that are not caused by an underlying neurological disease.\n        *   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** While blood tests are normal, there may be times when your electrolytes are off due to your symptoms.\n\n*   **Extreme Fatigue:**\n    *   *Possible Causes:*\n        *   **Sleep Disorders:** While narcolepsy was considered, other sleep disorders like idiopathic hypersomnia or sleep apnea could be contributing.  A formal sleep study is essential if you haven't had one.\n        *   **Depression:** Depression can definitely cause fatigue, but the severity you describe warrants further investigation.\n        *   **Autoimmune Disorders:** Fatigue is a common symptom of many autoimmune diseases.\n        *   **Thyroid Issues:** While blood tests were normal, ask about comprehensive thyroid testing (including TSH, free T4, free T3, and thyroid antibodies).\n        *   **Iron Deficiency/Anemia:**  Ensure iron levels, ferritin, and a complete blood count were thoroughly assessed.\n        *   **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS):**  Consider this if other causes are ruled out, especially if the fatigue is debilitating and worsened by exertion.\n        *   **Vitamin Deficiencies:**  Consider testing for Vitamin D and B12 deficiencies\n\n*   **Painful Joints:**\n    *   *Possible Causes:*\n        *   **Autoimmune Disorders (Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, etc.):**  This is a primary concern given the rheumatologist's suggestion.  The ANA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 tests are crucial.\n        *   **Osteoarthritis:**  Less likely at your age, but possible.\n        *   **Fibromyalgia:** A chronic pain condition that can cause widespread pain and fatigue.\n        *   **Infection:**  Less likely since blood tests are normal but ask about tickborne illness.\n\n*   **Mouth Sores and Dry/Chapped Lips:**\n    *   *Possible Causes:*\n        *   **Autoimmune Disorders (Lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome):** These are common symptoms of these disorders.\n        *   **Vitamin Deficiencies:**  B12, iron, or other vitamin deficiencies can cause mouth sores.\n        *   **Infection:**  Yeast infection/thrush, herpes simplex virus (cold sores).\n        *   **Dehydration:**  Make sure you are drinking enough water\n        *   **Medication Side Effects:**  Less likely since you've been on your current medications for a while, but still possible.\n        *   **Allergies:**  Could be an allergic reaction to food or skin products.\n\n*   **Low Fevers Before Period:**\n    *   *Possible Causes:*\n        *   **Hormonal Fluctuations:**  Normal hormonal shifts during the menstrual cycle can sometimes cause a slight temperature increase.\n        *   **Infection:**  Less likely if it's consistently cyclical, but still possible.\n        *   **Autoimmune Disorders:**  Symptoms of some autoimmune disorders can worsen before menstruation due to hormonal influences.\n\n*   **Hair Loss:**\n    *   *Possible Causes:*\n        *   **Autoimmune Disorders (Lupus, Alopecia Areata):**\n        *   **Thyroid Issues:**\n        *   **Iron Deficiency/Anemia:**\n        *   **Stress:**\n        *   **Medication Side Effects:**\n        *   **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n        *   **Telogen Effluvium:** Temporary hair loss that happens after stress, a shock, or a traumatic event.\n\n*   **Edibles Worsening Symptoms:**\n    *   This suggests a possible interaction with your underlying condition or medications.  THC/HHC can affect the nervous system and immune system, potentially exacerbating neurological or autoimmune symptoms.  It's best to avoid them until you have a diagnosis.\n\n**Next Steps and Questions to Ask Your Doctors:**\n\n1.  **Neurologist:**\n    *   \"Given the inconclusive EEG, what are the next steps in investigating the seizure-like episodes/movement disorder?  Should I consider prolonged EEG monitoring or an ambulatory EEG?\"\n    *   \"Could these episodes be related to medication side effects (Wellbutrin/Cymbalta), even though I've been on them for a while? What about Cymbalta withdrawal?\"\n    *   \"What other neurological conditions should we consider, given these symptoms?\"\n    *   \"Could this be a form of functional neurological disorder? How would we rule out other medical causes before considering that diagnosis?\"\n\n2.  **Rheumatologist:**\n    *   \"What specific autoimmune disorders are you considering, given my symptoms?\"\n    *   \"Can you explain the significance of the ANA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 tests you've ordered?\"\n    *   \"If the initial autoimmune blood work is negative, what other autoimmune tests should we consider?\"\n    *   \"Could these symptoms be caused by Sjogren's Syndrome?  Should I consider a lip biopsy?\"\n\n3.  **Psychiatrist:**\n    *   \"Is it possible that my current medications (Wellbutrin/Cymbalta) could be contributing to these neurological symptoms, even after being on them for a while?\"\n    *   \"What is the likelihood of tardive dyskinesia presenting in this way, with symptoms all over my body?\"\n    *   \"If the neurological symptoms are determined not to be medication-related, what alternative treatments are available for my depression that are less likely to cause neurological side effects?\"\n    *   \"If I go off cymbalta, what will the withdrawal be like and what can I do to prepare for it?\"\n\n4.  **Primary Care Physician:**\n    *   \"Can you help me coordinate my care between the different specialists?\"\n    *   \"Are there any other basic blood tests I should have to rule out common causes of fatigue, hair loss, or other symptoms (e.g., Vitamin D, B12, iron panel, comprehensive thyroid panel)?\"\n    *   \"What are your thoughts on the possibility of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) if other causes are ruled out?\"\n\n5.  **Sleep Specialist:**\n    *   \"Given my history of extreme fatigue and suspicion of narcolepsy, I would like to get tested for any other sleep disorders.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Record the timing, duration, and severity of all your symptoms, as well as any potential triggers (e.g., stress, food, activity). This will be invaluable for your doctors.\n*   **Bring a List of Medications and Supplements:**  Ensure all your doctors are aware of everything you're taking.\n*   **Be Your Own Advocate:**  Don't be afraid to ask questions, express your concerns, and seek second opinions if you're not satisfied with the answers you're receiving.\n*   **Consider a Multidisciplinary Approach:**  It sounds like you're already doing this, but continue to work with a team of specialists who can collaborate to understand the whole picture.\n\nIt's a long road to get to the bottom of something like this. Good luck with your journey!\n"

    "question": "I\u2019m 25 with seizures, been seizure free for about 5 years, I\u2019m on 200mg twice a day medication is lamotrigne, I\u2019m a heavy smoker I\u2019m a female I weigh 139lbs I\u2019m 5\u20196. Can I take shrooms?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're curious about taking psilocybin mushrooms (shrooms) given your history of seizures, medication, and other factors.  It's essential to consult with your doctor or neurologist before considering this. They have the most complete picture of your medical history and current health status and can provide personalized advice.\n\nHere's why medical consultation is crucial in this situation:\n\n*   **Interaction with Lamotrigine:** Psilocybin can interact with medications like lamotrigine in unpredictable ways. These interactions could potentially affect the efficacy of your seizure medication or increase the risk of side effects.\n\n*   **Seizure Risk:** While you've been seizure-free for 5 years, psilocybin can alter brain activity and potentially lower the seizure threshold. This means it could increase the risk of seizures, even if you've been stable on your medication.\n\n*   **Smoking:** Smoking can affect drug metabolism and might influence how your body processes both lamotrigine and psilocybin.\n\n*   **Individual Factors:** Your weight, height, and gender can also influence how your body responds to substances.\n\n**In summary, due to the potential risks involved, it's imperative to seek professional medical advice before considering taking shrooms. Your doctor can assess your individual risk factors and provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.**\n\n"

    "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy\u2014frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a complex and frustrating situation. You're experiencing significant health problems with no clear explanation, which is unfortunately common but nonetheless difficult to deal with. Let's break down the key elements and potential avenues to consider, given the information you've provided:\n\n**Summary of Your Situation:**\n\n*   **Young onset osteoporosis:** Z-score -2.4 at age 27 is significantly outside the expected range and represents osteoporosis for your age.\n*   **Spontaneous, non-traumatic compression fractures:** Multiple thoracic fractures, some severe, occurring in sleep.\n*   **New onset epilepsy:** Focal aware seizures starting around the same time as bone issues.\n*   **Extensive workup:** Labs and investigations have been largely normal, ruling out common causes.\n*   **Healthy lifestyle:** Well-nourished, physically active, non-smoker, minimal alcohol/soda.\n*   **Medication:** Lexapro use for 5 years prior to onset.\n*   **No family history:** Bone problems or epilepsy.\n\n**Possible Explanations to Re-Examine and Explore Further:**\n\nGiven that your workup has been extensive but inconclusive, it's crucial to revisit the possibilities, looking for subtle clues and considering less common conditions. Here's a breakdown of areas to focus on:\n\n1.  **Lexapro (Escitalopram): Potential Role**\n\n    *   **Serotonin and Bone:** SSRIs like Lexapro *have* been linked to decreased bone density and increased fracture risk in some studies, although the evidence is not entirely consistent. The mechanism isn't fully understood but is likely related to serotonin's role in bone metabolism.\n    *   **Seizure Threshold:** SSRIs can, in rare cases, lower the seizure threshold in some individuals, potentially contributing to the onset of epilepsy.\n    *   **Action Item:**  A *very* careful discussion with your psychiatrist and neurologist is crucial. It's important to weigh the benefits of Lexapro against the potential risks, particularly given your new health problems.\n        *   Could you be tapered off Lexapro to see if your bone density improves and seizure frequency changes? This is a complex decision and should be made with careful medical supervision and monitoring.\n        *   Are there alternative medications for depression that might have a lower risk profile concerning bone health and seizure threshold?\n    *   **Documentation:** Thoroughly document the timeline of Lexapro initiation relative to the onset of both your bone and seizure issues.\n\n2.  **Subtle Endocrine Disorders (Re-evaluate)**\n\n    *   **Vitamin D Metabolism:** You may have already had this tested, but make sure it's *comprehensive*. Not just 25-hydroxyvitamin D, but also 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Consider genetic testing related to vitamin D receptor function.\n    *   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):** While primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caught, subtle fluctuations or intermittent elevations can be missed. Consider *serial* PTH measurements over several days, taken at the same time each day, along with serum calcium levels.  A 24-hour urine calcium collection might also be helpful.\n    *   **Cushing's Syndrome/Disease:**  Even mild hypercortisolism can contribute to bone loss.  Repeat testing, focusing on overnight dexamethasone suppression tests, 24-hour urine cortisol, and late-night salivary cortisol.  Consider referral to an endocrinologist specializing in adrenal disorders.\n    *   **Thyroid Function:** While you likely had TSH tested, ensure free T4 and free T3 were also evaluated.  Rarely, subtle thyroid abnormalities can affect bone metabolism.\n    *   **Celiac Disease:**  Even in the absence of classic gastrointestinal symptoms, Celiac disease can cause malabsorption and affect bone density. Make sure you've had proper Celiac serology (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody) *while* consuming gluten.  If serology is borderline, consider duodenal biopsy.\n\n3.  **Less Common Metabolic Bone Diseases**\n\n    *   **Osteomalacia:** This is distinct from osteoporosis. It involves a defect in bone mineralization. Look for low serum phosphate, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and consider bone biopsy if suspicion is high.\n    *   **Hypophosphatasia:** A rare genetic disorder affecting alkaline phosphatase. Look for low alkaline phosphatase levels.\n    *   **Mastocytosis:** In rare cases, systemic mastocytosis can cause bone loss and fractures. Look for elevated serum tryptase levels and consider bone marrow biopsy if suspicion is high.\n\n4.  **Neurological Causes (Epilepsy Focus)**\n\n    *   **Seizure Type and Location:** Work closely with your neurologist to fully characterize your seizure type and the location of seizure activity in your brain.  Are there any specific areas that could be indirectly affecting bone metabolism (e.g., hypothalamic region)?\n    *   **EEG Monitoring:** Consider prolonged EEG monitoring (including sleep EEG) to capture more seizure activity and better define the epileptogenic zone.\n    *   **Brain MRI:** Has a high-resolution brain MRI been performed to rule out any structural abnormalities (e.g., tumors, lesions) that could be causing both the seizures and, indirectly, affecting bone health?\n\n5.  **Genetics (Consider if Still Unclear)**\n\n    *   **Genetic Testing:** If other causes are ruled out, consider genetic testing for rare bone disorders and epilepsy syndromes.\n    *   **Whole Exome Sequencing:** In particularly challenging cases, whole exome sequencing might identify a rare or novel genetic mutation contributing to your condition.\n\n6.  **Fracture Evaluation**\n\n    *   **Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA):**  Use VFA on DXA scans or lateral spine X-rays to monitor existing and identify new fractures.\n    *   **Fracture Healing:** How are the fractures healing? Delayed or non-union could suggest an underlying metabolic or vascular problem.\n\n7.  **Dietary Considerations**\n\n    *   **Calcium and Vitamin D Intake:** While you likely have had this assessed, ensure you are consuming adequate calcium and vitamin D through diet and supplementation. Work with a registered dietitian.\n\n**Actionable Steps:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Lexapro Discussion:** Have a detailed discussion with your psychiatrist and neurologist about the potential risks and benefits of Lexapro.\n2.  **Comprehensive Re-evaluation:** Work with your endocrinologist to re-evaluate all endocrine labs, potentially ordering serial tests for PTH and cortisol.\n3.  **Neurological Review:** Collaborate closely with your neurologist to further characterize your seizures and rule out any underlying structural brain abnormalities.\n4.  **Consider Additional Testing:** Discuss the possibility of testing for osteomalacia, hypophosphatasia, and mastocytosis with your endocrinologist.\n5.  **Genetic Consultation:** If other causes are ruled out, explore genetic testing options.\n6.  **Dietary Assessment:** Consult with a registered dietitian to ensure you are consuming adequate calcium and vitamin D.\n7.  **Bone Density Monitoring:** Continue regular bone density monitoring with DXA scans.\n8.  **Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of your symptoms, medications, and test results.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Rare Disease Possibility:** Be prepared for the possibility that you have a rare or undiagnosed disease. This may require consultation with specialists at a major academic medical center.\n*   **Advocacy:** You need to be a strong advocate for your own health. Keep asking questions, pushing for further investigation, and seeking second opinions when necessary.\n*   **Emotional Support:** Dealing with chronic health problems and diagnostic uncertainty can be incredibly stressful. Seek emotional support from family, friends, or a therapist.\n\nIt's understandable to feel frustrated with the lack of a clear diagnosis. By systematically re-evaluating potential causes and pursuing further testing, you can hopefully find an answer and develop an effective treatment plan. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a very understandable and valid concern.  Given your son's recent tonic-clonic seizure and the lack of a diagnosis and treatment plan, combined with the remote location of your planned trip, **canceling the trip is the safest option.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why and what you should consider:\n\n**Why canceling is the safest option:**\n\n*   **Unknown Etiology:**  The fact that you haven't seen a pediatrician yet means you don't know the cause of the seizure.  It could be a one-off event (though the prior absent moments suggest otherwise), or it could be the start of an ongoing seizure disorder.  Without knowing the underlying cause, it's difficult to predict future seizure risk.\n*   **Risk of Further Seizures:** After an initial seizure, the risk of recurrence is significantly higher. Any further seizures on holiday far away from medical support (which is also in a different language to what you are familiar with) is best avoided.\n*   **Remote Location:** A 30-minute drive to the nearest hospital, even in the UK, is significant in the event of a seizure, especially if it's prolonged or followed by another seizure. Being in a foreign country amplifies the challenges.\n*   **Post-Seizure Complications:**  After a tonic-clonic seizure, individuals can experience confusion, disorientation, muscle soreness, and exhaustion.  Traveling immediately after a seizure, or having one during a trip, can make the experience much more difficult for your son and for you to manage.\n*   **Absent Seizures:** You have noticed your son having absent seizures, which suggests this may be the start of an on going condition.\n*   **Medication Considerations:** If your son does have epilepsy, it will take time to find the right medication and the right dose. This is best done with the advice of a local clinician.\n\n**What to do instead of the trip:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize the Pediatrician Appointment:**  Push to get an appointment with the pediatrician as soon as possible.  Explain the urgency of the situation and the planned trip.\n2.  **EEG:** An EEG (electroencephalogram) is a crucial test to help diagnose seizure disorders.  Ask the pediatrician if they can order one immediately.\n3.  **Discuss Emergency Plans:**  If you are able to see the pediatrician before your planned trip, discuss emergency plans. If you are not able to have a face to face appointment with them, try and have a phone call or a telehealth meeting.  They might suggest carrying emergency medication (like rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam) to stop a prolonged seizure.  Discuss when and how to administer these medications.\n4.  **Learn Basic Seizure First Aid:**  Ensure you, and anyone else traveling with you, knows how to respond to a seizure.  This includes:\n    *   Staying calm.\n    *   Protecting the person from injury (clearing the area, placing something soft under their head).\n    *   Turning them onto their side (recovery position) after the seizure.\n    *   Timing the seizure.\n    *   Knowing when to call for emergency medical help (seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes, repeated seizures, injury during the seizure, difficulty breathing afterward).\n5.  **Travel Insurance:**  If you decide to proceed with the trip *against* medical advice, ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance that covers pre-existing conditions, including seizures.  Be completely honest with the insurance company about your son's condition.  Keep in mind that some policies may not cover conditions that are currently under investigation.\n6. **Language barrier** If a seizure occurs in France, communication with medical teams may be difficult, adding to stress and potential delays in care.\n\n**Why you might be worrying *too much*** (though I don't think you are):\n\n*   **It *could* be a one-off event:**  Sometimes a seizure is triggered by a temporary factor (e.g., fever, sleep deprivation, electrolyte imbalance) and doesn't recur. However, given the history of \"absent moments,\" this is less likely.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nWhile it's disappointing to cancel a planned trip, your son's health and safety are the priority.  The uncertainty surrounding his condition, combined with the remote location, makes canceling the trip the most prudent decision. Focus on getting him evaluated by a pediatrician and establishing a diagnosis and treatment plan.  Once you have more information, you can reassess travel plans in the future.\n\nIt is essential to see your son's doctor as soon as possible to receive personalised medical advice for his specific situation.\n"

    "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. You're a 22-year-old female with epilepsy, POTS, and currently taking lithium, buspirone, and lamotrigine. You've had two urinalyses showing 25 RBC/uL, and you're curious about the likely next steps, especially since you have no UTI symptoms and are not currently on your period.\n\nGiven your history, medications, and the persistent hematuria (blood in urine), here\u2019s a breakdown of likely next steps and potential considerations:\n\n**Likely Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Repeat Urinalysis with Microscopy:** The doctor may want another urinalysis, this time with a closer look at the urine under a microscope. This helps to:\n\n    *   **Confirm the Presence of RBCs:** Ensures it's not a lab error or contamination.\n    *   **Look for RBC Casts:** These are structures formed in the kidney tubules, which can indicate kidney-related bleeding. The absence of casts is reassuring, but their presence is highly significant.\n    *   **Evaluate for Other Cellular Elements:** This can rule out or suggest other causes, such as inflammation.\n*   **Urine Culture:** Even though you have no UTI symptoms, a urine culture is typically done to definitively rule out a low-grade or unusual infection, especially since you\u2019re on medications that could potentially affect your immune system or urinary tract.\n*   **Kidney Function Tests:** Blood tests to assess kidney function are standard. These usually include:\n\n    *   **Creatinine:** Measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood.\n    *   **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen):** Another measure of kidney function.\n    *   **eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):** A calculation based on creatinine, age, sex, and race to estimate how well your kidneys are filtering.\n*   **Consultation with a Nephrologist (Kidney Specialist):** Given the persistent hematuria, a referral to a nephrologist is highly likely, even if the initial workup seems relatively benign.\n*   **Imaging Studies:** If the nephrologist deems it necessary, they might order:\n    *   **Renal Ultrasound:** This is a non-invasive way to visualize the kidneys and bladder to look for stones, masses, or structural abnormalities.\n    *   **CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis (with and without contrast):** Provides more detailed images of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Contrast dye is often used to enhance the images, but it's important to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor, especially given your medical history and medications.\n    *   **Cystoscopy:** A procedure where a small camera is inserted into the bladder to visualize the lining. This is typically done if there is a concern about bladder lesions or other abnormalities, especially if risk factors are present.\n\n**Possible Causes and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Medication Side Effects:**\n    *   **Lithium:** Although it's less common, lithium can sometimes affect kidney function and potentially cause microscopic hematuria.\n    *   **Lamotrigine:** While less commonly associated with kidney issues, any medication can have unexpected side effects.\n*   **Kidney Stones:** You mentioned possible kidney stones. Even small stones can cause microscopic hematuria.\n*   **POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome):** While not a direct cause of hematuria, POTS can sometimes be associated with changes in blood pressure and fluid balance that *could* indirectly affect kidney function in some individuals. It's a less common consideration, but worth noting in your overall picture.\n*   **Glomerular Disease:** This refers to diseases that affect the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli). This is less likely given your age and lack of other symptoms, but it needs to be ruled out, especially if RBC casts are found.\n*   **Benign Familial Hematuria (Thin Basement Membrane Disease):** A common cause of microscopic hematuria in young, otherwise healthy individuals. It's usually benign and doesn't require treatment, but it's diagnosed through kidney biopsy (not usually done unless other concerns arise).\n*   **IgA Nephropathy (Berger's Disease):** Another glomerular disease that can cause hematuria.\n*   **Bladder Irritation/Inflammation:** Even without a full-blown UTI, irritation of the bladder lining can cause hematuria. This could be from certain foods, drinks, or even vigorous exercise (though you didn\u2019t mention exercise being a trigger).\n*   **Tumors/Cancers:** While rare at your age, tumors of the kidney or bladder can cause hematuria. This is why it's important to investigate.\n\n**Recommendations for Now:**\n\n*   **Increase Fluid Intake:** Staying well-hydrated can help flush out your kidneys and urinary tract.\n*   **Monitor for Symptoms:** Pay attention to any new symptoms like flank pain, changes in urination (frequency, urgency, pain), or blood clots in the urine.\n*   **Avoid NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs):** These can potentially affect kidney function and should be avoided unless specifically recommended by your doctor.\n*   **Review Medications:** When you see your doctor, make sure to review all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n*   **Dietary Considerations:** Some foods/drinks (beets, rhubarb, blackberries) can temporarily discolor urine, mimicking blood. Make sure your urine discoloration is not related to these.\n*   **Provide a Detailed History:** When you see the doctor, be prepared to provide a thorough medical history, including any family history of kidney disease, bleeding disorders, or cancers.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Lithium:**\n\n*   **Lithium and Kidney Function:** Long-term lithium use can affect kidney function in some individuals. It's crucial that your kidney function is monitored regularly while you're on lithium. The hematuria could be related to this, even if you've only recently started the medication.\n*   **Hydration:** Adequate hydration is particularly important when taking lithium, as dehydration can increase lithium levels and potentially affect kidney function.\n\n**In summary,** persistent hematuria, even at low levels, warrants investigation to rule out underlying causes. While the most likely causes at your age are benign, it's essential to have a thorough workup to ensure your kidneys are healthy and to address any potential issues early. The nephrologist will guide the investigation based on your specific case and medical history.\n"

    "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down.  I am an AI and can't provide medical advice. It's important to consult with a qualified medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. However, I can offer some information and points to consider that might be helpful in discussing this with a doctor.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the situation:**\n\n*   **Possible Light Sensitivity:** This is a key trigger to note. Bright and fast lights causing a reaction is concerning.\n\n*   **Symptoms:**\n    *   Shaking\n    *   Vomiting\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Cold/Numbness\n    *   Normal Blood Pressure/Heart Rate (Important to know)\n\n*   **Past Epilepsy Test (Negative at 15):**  A negative test at 15 doesn't guarantee you won't develop epilepsy later. Epilepsy can develop at any age.\n\n*   **Hormone Issues & Normocis:** The connection between your hormone issues, Normocis, and these symptoms is something a doctor needs to evaluate.\n\n*   **Family History of Epilepsy:** This increases your risk slightly.\n\n**Could it be Epilepsy?**\n\nIt's *possible* that your symptoms are related to photosensitive epilepsy, which is a type of epilepsy triggered by flashing or flickering lights. However, the symptoms you described could also be caused by other things.\n\n**Other possibilities include:**\n\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** Migraines can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances (aura), dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and numbness.\n\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate that can cause fainting or near-fainting. It can be triggered by various things, including stress, pain, and sometimes even bright lights.\n\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Attack:**  While your blood pressure was normal, anxiety can sometimes cause physical symptoms like shaking, nausea, and dizziness.\n\n*   **Metabolic Issues/Hormonal Imbalance:** Your hormone issues and medication (Normocis) could potentially be playing a role.\n\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are other, less common neurological conditions that could present with these symptoms.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor (ASAP):**  Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a neurologist *immediately*.  Explain all of your symptoms in detail, including the light exposure and the duration of the event.\n\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Record:**  Start keeping a log of any similar events. Note the date, time, what you were doing, what triggered it (if known), the specific symptoms, how long they lasted, and what (if anything) helped.\n\n3.  **Be Prepared for Testing:**  Your doctor may order some or all of the following:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This measures the electrical activity in your brain and can help diagnose epilepsy. You may want to ask for a \"photoparoxysmal response\" or \"photic stimulation\" during the EEG, which specifically tests for photosensitivity.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** This can help rule out other structural problems in the brain.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for hormonal imbalances, metabolic issues, and other potential causes.\n    *   **Cardiac Evaluation:**  Since you experienced numbness and coldness, they might rule out any cardiac issues.\n\n4.  **Medication List:** Bring a list of all medications and supplements you're taking, including Normocis, and details about your hormone issues.\n\n5.  **Avoid Triggers:** If you suspect that bright lights are a trigger, try to avoid them until you see a doctor.  Wear sunglasses outdoors, and avoid situations with flashing lights (e.g., strobe lights, certain video games).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:**  It's crucial to get a professional medical opinion.\n*   **Don't Panic:**  While it's important to take this seriously, try to stay calm. Many of the possible causes are treatable.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Be clear and persistent with your doctor. If you don't feel like you're being heard or that your concerns are being adequately addressed, seek a second opinion.\n\nThe symptoms you experienced warrant a thorough medical evaluation. Good luck, and I hope you get some answers soon!\n"

    "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, that sounds incredibly overwhelming and frightening. It's completely understandable that you're feeling terrified with everything you're going through. Let's break down your concerns and discuss them, keeping in mind that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. You need to discuss these issues with your doctors.\n\n**1. Lifespan and Uncontrolled Seizures:**\n\n*   **Mortality Risk:** Uncontrolled seizures, particularly tonic-clonic seizures, *can* increase mortality risk. The primary concern is from accidents during seizures, status epilepticus (prolonged seizures), and SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy).\n*   **Aspiration Pneumonia:** Your recent aspiration pneumonia is also a serious concern that can impact long-term health. Repeated aspiration can lead to lung damage and further complications.\n*   **Importance of Control:** Improving seizure control is paramount to improving your overall health and potentially impacting your lifespan.\n\n**2. Spinal Decompression Surgery and Chiari 1:**\n\n*   **Candidate Assessment:** Whether you're a candidate for spinal decompression surgery is something that *only* a neurosurgeon specializing in Chiari malformations can determine. The factors they'll consider include:\n    *   **Severity of your symptoms:** You have a syrinx and neurological symptoms, which suggests that your Chiari is causing problems.\n    *   **Size and location of the syrinx:** The size of the syrinx is relevant, as is its impact on your spinal cord.\n    *   **Extent of the cerebellar tonsillar herniation:** How far down your cerebellar tonsils are protruding.\n    *   **Response to conservative treatments:** If any other treatments, such as physical therapy or pain management, have been attempted.\n    *   **Overall health:** Your overall health will influence your ability to undergo and recover from surgery.\n*   **Chiari Surgery and Epilepsy:** Spinal decompression surgery is *primarily* aimed at alleviating symptoms related to the Chiari malformation itself (headaches, neck pain, balance problems, weakness, sensory changes). *It is not typically a direct treatment for epilepsy.*\n    *   **Possible Indirect Benefit:** In *some* very rare cases, if the Chiari malformation is directly contributing to the seizures (which is uncommon, but not impossible), decompression *might* have an indirect positive effect. *However, this is not the primary goal of the surgery, and it is unlikely to control epilepsy originating in Broca's area.*\n* **Summary:** Talk to your neurologist and neurosurgeon immediately about the possibility of surgery.\n\n**3. SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy):**\n\n*   **Risk Factors:** Uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures are a significant risk factor for SUDEP. Other risk factors include:\n    *   Frequent seizures, especially at night\n    *   Poor medication adherence\n    *   Younger age at onset of epilepsy\n    *   Having a diagnosed learning disability\n*   **Reducing Risk:** The best way to reduce SUDEP risk is to achieve the best possible seizure control. This might involve medication adjustments, alternative therapies, and lifestyle changes.\n*   **Open Communication:** Discuss your SUDEP risk with your neurologist. They can provide personalized advice and strategies to minimize your risk.\n\n**4. What to Do Now: Immediate Steps**\n\n1.  **Neurologist Appointment (ASAP):** This is your *absolute priority*. You need a thorough review of your seizure management plan. Discuss:\n    *   **Medication Optimization:** Are you on the right medications at the correct dosages? Are there alternative medications or combinations to try?\n    *   **Diagnostic Testing:** Have you had recent EEGs (electroencephalograms) and MRIs? These are essential to assess your brain activity and identify any structural changes.\n    *   **VNS, RNS, DBS:** If medications are not working well, ask your neurologist about alternative therapies.\n    *   **Referral to an Epilepsy Specialist:** A comprehensive epilepsy center can offer advanced diagnostic testing and treatment options.\n2.  **Neurosurgeon Consultation (ASAP):** Discuss your Chiari 1 malformation, syrinx, and whether you are a surgical candidate. Get their opinion on whether surgery could alleviate any of your neurological symptoms.\n3.  **Aspiration Precautions:** Work with your doctors to minimize the risk of future aspiration:\n    *   **Medication Review:** Some medications can increase the risk of vomiting or drowsiness.\n    *   **Dietary Modifications:** If you have difficulty swallowing, a speech therapist can recommend dietary changes and swallowing techniques.\n    *   **Positioning:** Sleep in a position that minimizes the risk of aspiration (e.g., on your side).\n4.  **Counseling and Support:**\n    *   **Therapy:** Find a therapist who can help you cope with the anxiety and fear associated with your condition. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful.\n    *   **Support Groups:** Connect with others who have epilepsy and/or Chiari malformation. Sharing your experiences and learning from others can be invaluable.\n5.  **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Sleep:** Prioritize getting enough sleep, as sleep deprivation can trigger seizures.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing.\n    *   **Diet:** Maintain a healthy, balanced diet.\n    *   **Avoid Triggers:** Identify and avoid any known seizure triggers (e.g., alcohol, flashing lights).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Your Husband:** Your husband's health issues are undoubtedly adding to your stress. It's important to find ways to support each other while also prioritizing your own health.\n*   **Naked Episode:** The episode where you ran around naked indicates a significant alteration of consciousness during the seizure. This further emphasizes the need for better seizure control and close monitoring.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek second opinions, and advocate for the best possible care. Your health is your priority.\n\n**In summary, you need to be proactive in seeking expert medical care. The combination of Chiari, syrinx, and uncontrolled seizures requires a coordinated approach from a neurologist and neurosurgeon. Focus on optimizing seizure control, addressing the Chiari malformation, and managing your overall health and well-being.**\n"

    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're worried about your mom's memory. It's a significant change and especially concerning given her epilepsy history. It's also great you're researching and trying to understand the potential connections. Let's break down your concerns and discuss actionable steps you can take.\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Concerns and Questions:**\n\n*   **Is 60 too early to tell?** 60 is not necessarily \"too early\" for cognitive changes to occur. While Alzheimer's is more prevalent in older populations, early-onset Alzheimer's can happen. Additionally, other forms of dementia or cognitive impairment can occur at any age. The fact that you've noticed a change warrants further investigation, regardless of age.\n*   **Once her memory starts to decline, how long does she have still being lucid?** This is unfortunately impossible to predict. The progression of cognitive decline varies greatly depending on the underlying cause, individual factors, and the effectiveness of any interventions. Some people experience a slow, gradual decline over many years, while others experience a more rapid progression.\n*   **Do grand mal seizures damage the temporal lobe in the same way focal seizures do?** This is a crucial question for your mom's specific situation. While focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe are strongly associated with memory issues, generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) can also have an impact on cognitive function.\n\n    *   **Generalized Seizures & Brain Impact:** Grand mal seizures involve the entire brain, including the temporal lobes. While they may not cause *specific* damage to the temporal lobe in the same way as a focal seizure, the intense electrical activity, oxygen deprivation, and metabolic stress associated with these seizures can contribute to overall brain damage over time. This can manifest as cognitive decline, including memory problems.\n    *   **Lack of Research:** You're correct that there is a need for more research in this area. The exact mechanisms by which different seizure types impact long-term cognitive function are still being investigated.\n*   **If that is what\u2019s happening, how do i make her feel loved and comfortable?** This is the most important question and one you can address proactively.\n\n    *   **Patience and Understanding:** Acknowledge her struggles and avoid correcting her constantly. Offer gentle reminders and support without being condescending.\n    *   **Creating a Supportive Environment:** Simplify her surroundings, reduce clutter, and establish routines to minimize confusion. Use visual cues, labels, and memory aids like calendars and notes.\n    *   **Meaningful Activities:** Engage her in activities she enjoys, even if she can no longer do them as independently. Focus on creating positive experiences and connections.\n    *   **Communication:** Speak clearly and slowly, use simple language, and avoid complex conversations when she's tired or overwhelmed. Listen attentively and validate her feelings.\n    *   **Reminiscence:** Encourage her to share stories from her past. Looking at old photos and reminiscing can be comforting and help preserve her sense of identity.\n    *   **Physical Comfort:** Ensure she is comfortable and pain-free. Address any physical limitations and provide support as needed.\n    *   **Advocacy:** Be her advocate in medical settings and ensure her needs are being met.\n    *   **Respite:** Don't forget to take care of yourself! Caregiving can be emotionally and physically draining. Seek support from family, friends, or professional caregivers to prevent burnout.\n    *   **Unconditional Love:** Let her know you love her and are there for her, no matter what.\n\n**Actionable Steps You Can Take:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation:** This is the most crucial step. Your mom needs to be seen by a neurologist (preferably one specializing in epilepsy) to discuss your concerns. Be prepared to provide a detailed history of her seizures, current medications, your observations of her memory changes, and the family history of mental illness.\n2.  **Neuropsychological Testing:** Ask the neurologist about neuropsychological testing. This type of testing can provide a more detailed assessment of her cognitive function and identify specific areas of strength and weakness. This can help determine if there is significant cognitive impairment.\n3.  **Brain Imaging:** Discuss the possibility of brain imaging (MRI) with the neurologist. This can help rule out other potential causes of her memory problems, such as tumors, stroke, or structural abnormalities. It can also show if there is evidence of damage in specific brain regions.\n4.  **Discuss Medication Review:** Discuss with her doctors (neurologist and psychiatrist) whether her current medications could be contributing to her cognitive issues. Some medications, including certain anti-epileptic drugs and antidepressants, can have cognitive side effects.\n5.  **Consult a Geriatrician or Memory Clinic:** Consider a consultation with a geriatrician or a specialized memory clinic. These specialists can provide a comprehensive evaluation and offer guidance on managing cognitive decline.\n6.  **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed journal of her seizures, medications, and cognitive changes. This will be invaluable to her healthcare team.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** It's important to consider other potential causes of cognitive decline besides Alzheimer's or epilepsy-related damage. These include:\n    *   **Vascular Dementia:** Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Lewy Body Dementia:** A type of dementia that can cause visual hallucinations and movement problems.\n    *   **Frontotemporal Dementia:** A type of dementia that affects personality and behavior.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:** As mentioned above.\n    *   **Depression:** Depression can significantly impact cognitive function.\n    *   **Vitamin Deficiencies:** B12 deficiency can cause cognitive problems.\n    *   **Thyroid Problems:** Hypothyroidism can also affect cognitive function.\n    *   **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH):** A condition in which fluid builds up in the brain.\n*   **Family History:** Your family history of mental illness is relevant and should be discussed with the neurologist. Some mental health conditions can also impact cognitive function.\n*   **Past Cancer Treatment:** Her history of estrogen-binding cancer and subsequent treatment (mastectomy and hysterectomy) could potentially be related to cognitive changes. Cancer treatments can sometimes have long-term effects on the brain.\n*   **Substance Use History:** Even brief past substance use can have lasting effects on cognitive function, even years later.\n\n**How to Approach Talking to Your Mom:**\n\nThis is a delicate conversation. Choose a time when she is relaxed and receptive.\n\n*   **Express Your Love and Concern:** Start by telling her how much you love her and that you've noticed some changes in her memory that you're concerned about.\n*   **Avoid Blame or Accusation:** Don't say things like, \"You're always forgetting things!\" Instead, use \"I\" statements, such as, \"I've noticed that you've been having trouble remembering names lately, and I'm a little worried.\"\n*   **Emphasize Getting Help:** Frame the conversation as wanting to get her the best possible care. Say something like, \"I want to make sure you're healthy and that we're doing everything we can to support you. I think it would be a good idea to talk to a doctor about these memory changes to see if there's anything we can do.\"\n*   **Offer Support:** Let her know that you'll be there with her every step of the way, and that you'll go to doctor's appointments with her and help her manage her medications.\n*   **Be Patient:** She may be resistant to the idea of seeking help, so be patient and understanding.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nYour concerns are valid, and your intuition as her daughter is important. Don't hesitate to seek professional medical advice. By taking proactive steps, you can help ensure your mom receives the best possible care and support. Remember to focus on creating a loving and supportive environment for her, regardless of the underlying cause of her memory problems.

Sleep seizures during the depression but they are gone now.Thanks for any input.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, given your complex medical history including systemic scleroderma, epilepsy, chronic migraines, possible MS, and recent grief, the eye shaking you describe upon waking (which sounds like nystagmus) warrants investigation, but also has several possible explanations. Let's break it down:\n\n**Likely Possibilities and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Neurological Etiology (Most Important to Rule Out):**\n\n    *   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Nystagmus is a common symptom of MS. The \"mixed\" results you had make this a strong consideration. MS lesions in the brainstem, which controls eye movements, can cause nystagmus. Your previous workup, including MRI, needs to be reviewed in light of this symptom.\n    *   **Brainstem Lesion (Other Causes):** Aside from MS, other potential causes of brainstem lesions causing nystagmus include stroke, tumors, inflammation, or other neurological conditions. The fact that it's been going on for years makes acute stroke less likely, but these possibilities still need to be considered, especially if the nystagmus has changed or worsened.\n    *   **Epilepsy Related:** While you mentioned your sleep seizures are controlled, it's important to consider that subclinical seizure activity or interictal discharges (electrical activity in the brain between seizures) *could* contribute to neurological dysfunction manifesting as nystagmus, especially upon waking. Reviewing your EEG findings (if available) might be helpful.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:** While less likely, *some* medications can rarely cause nystagmus. It would be useful to check the side effect profiles for each medication you are taking.\n\n*   **Migraine-Related Nystagmus:** Some types of migraine can cause nystagmus, often during the migraine itself. It is somewhat less likely to be the cause of your eye shaking since it only happens on waking when sleep deprived or having slept poorly, but it can't be completely ruled out.\n\n*   **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV):** Though less likely given the up-and-down pattern you describe and the triggering factors, BPPV causes vertigo and nystagmus when changing head positions.\n\n*   **Fatigue/Sleep Deprivation/Muscle Strain:** You're right, this is a possible contributing factor, but less likely to be the *sole* cause, given your other medical issues. Severe fatigue can affect neurological function, and strained eye muscles *could* contribute, but this needs to be ruled out *after* considering the neurological causes.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Neurology Consultation (Essential):**  You *must* discuss this with your neurologist ASAP. If you have multiple neurologists involved due to the MS uncertainty, try to coordinate communication between them.\n\n    *   **Comprehensive Neurological Exam:** A detailed exam focused on eye movements, cranial nerves, coordination, and balance is crucial.\n    *   **Review of Previous Imaging:** The neurologist needs to thoroughly review your previous brain MRI scans (especially the MS protocol) to look for any changes or subtle lesions that might have been missed initially.\n    *   **Repeat/Advanced Imaging:** Depending on the exam and review, the neurologist may recommend repeat MRI (with and without contrast) or more advanced imaging techniques.\n    *   **Vestibular Testing:** This can help to rule out or confirm inner ear problems like BPPV.\n    *   **Consider EEG:** If there is any suspicion that the eye shaking could be related to seizure activity.\n\n2.  **Ophthalmology Consultation (Consider):** Consider seeing an ophthalmologist, particularly one specializing in neuro-ophthalmology, for a more detailed evaluation of your eye movements and visual pathways.\n\n3.  **Medication Review:** Discuss your medications with your doctor/pharmacist to see if any could be contributing to the nystagmus.\n\n4.  **Scleroderma Specialist:** Let your rheumatologist (or whoever manages your scleroderma) know about this new symptom. While less directly related, systemic conditions can sometimes manifest with neurological symptoms.\n\n5.  **Document the Episodes:** Keep a log of when the eye shaking occurs, how long it lasts, what makes it better or worse, and any other associated symptoms (dizziness, headache, nausea, etc.). This information will be valuable for your doctors.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Your Medications:**\n\n*   **Tylenol Overuse:** 1000-2000mg of Tylenol daily is a *very* high dose and can cause liver damage over time. Please discuss alternative pain management strategies with your doctor. There may be better options, especially given your other health conditions.\n*   **Mirtazapine:** While Mirtazapine can be helpful for sleep and depression, it also has potential side effects. Be sure to monitor for side effects.\n*   **Drug Interactions:** Be sure all your doctors and pharmacist are aware of all the medications you are taking to prevent potential drug interactions.\n\n**In summary, the eye shaking is a new symptom that needs to be investigated promptly and thoroughly, especially given your history of possible MS and other neurological issues.  Don't delay in seeking neurological evaluation.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

    "question": "Bipolar, OCD, TL Epilepsy (I am questioning this, diagnosed with absence seizures but I don\u2019t think this fits) 200mg Topamax 2x daily, 200mg sertraline, 3mg risperidone, 30mg abilify, 1000IU vitamin D, 40mg somac, I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was around 17-18, but my neurologist just doesn\u2019t really listen to me. He diagnosed me with absence seizures but the problem is I\u2019ve never forgotten a seizure or lost consciousness. Now I\u2019m realising that what he\u2019s called my \u2018motor tics\u2019 could be seizures as well. Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I\u2019m off my meds. But the past week I haven\u2019t really been sleeping and I\u2019ve had the flu and I\u2019ve been unable to twitch and it\u2019s like the feeling is building up in the back of my head and its getting really uncomfortable and making it sometimes hard to breathe. Sometimes painful. The feeling is completely involuntary, kind of like a sneeze, and it feels like when you can\u2019t sneeze. What should I do? My neurologist doesn\u2019t listen to me. I have a GP appointment in 2 days, should I talk to her about it?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds really distressing and concerning. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated with your neurologist and are seeking clarity. Let's break down what you should do:\n\n**Immediate Actions (Before Your GP Appointment):**\n\n*   **Document Everything:** Before your GP appointment, meticulously document these events. Include:\n    *   **Frequency:** How often are these \"head jerks\" happening, especially recently?\n    *   **Triggers:** What seems to make them worse (lack of sleep, stress, illness, being off meds)?\n    *   **Detailed Description:** Focus on the sensation in the back of your head \u2013 the \"pulse of electricity,\" where exactly it's located, and the sensation of building pressure. Describe the head jerk itself (direction, force). Describe the grunt \u2013 is it a single sound or multiple?\n    *   **Associated Symptoms:** Note the difficulty breathing, pain, any changes in vision, dizziness, confusion, or other sensations you experience *before, during, or after* the head jerk.\n    *   **Impact:** How do these events impact your daily life (work, relationships, mood)?\n    *   **Medication Compliance:** Specifically note if you have missed any doses of your medications recently.\n*   **Sleep:** Prioritize sleep as much as possible in the next two days. This may be difficult with the discomfort you're experiencing, but even short naps can help.\n*   **Hydration and Nutrition:** Make sure you are adequately hydrated and eating regular meals.\n*   **Avoid Triggers (If Known):** Try to minimize any known triggers, such as stress or bright, flashing lights (if these seem to be relevant).\n\n**What to Discuss with Your GP:**\n\n1.  **The Ineffectiveness of Current Neurologist:** Explain clearly that you feel your neurologist isn't listening to your concerns and that you are questioning the original diagnosis of absence seizures. It's okay to express that you feel dismissed.\n2.  **Detailed Description of the Events:**  Present your documented description of the head jerks, focusing on the \"pulse of electricity,\" involuntary nature, grunting sound, breathing difficulty, pain, and the feeling of pressure building up. This is crucial.\n3.  **Suspicion of Different Type of Seizure:** Tell your GP that you suspect these \"motor tics\" could be a different type of seizure, potentially focal seizures, and that you have never lost consciousness during an event.  Explain why you doubt the absence seizure diagnosis (no loss of consciousness or memory).\n4.  **Worsening Symptoms:** Emphasize that the symptoms have worsened recently due to lack of sleep and illness, and the uncomfortable \"building up\" feeling is concerning.\n5.  **Need for Further Evaluation:**  Request a referral to a *different* neurologist, preferably one with expertise in epilepsy and seizure disorders. It might be helpful to ask your GP if they have a neurologist they trust or would recommend.\n6.  **EEG Considerations:** Discuss the possibility of another EEG, specifically one that can be done while you are *awake and asleep* and that is longer than a standard EEG (e.g., ambulatory EEG, video EEG monitoring). This is important because seizures can be more likely to be detected during sleep or during periods of heightened stress or when you are off your medication.\n7.  **Medication Review:**  While it's important to be open to the possibility of seizure-related activity, it's also important to discuss whether your current medication regimen for bipolar disorder is optimal, given your symptoms. Be open to the possibility that some of your symptoms could be related to medication side effects or interactions. However, *do not adjust your medication dosages without consulting your doctor.*\n8.  **Rule Out Other Potential Causes:** While focusing on potential seizures is important, it's also reasonable to ask your GP to consider other potential causes for your symptoms. For example, they may want to rule out musculoskeletal issues, tension headaches, or other neurological conditions.\n\n**Why This is Important:**\n\n*   **Accuracy of Diagnosis:** Getting the correct diagnosis is critical for effective treatment.\n*   **Seizure Type and Treatment:** Different types of seizures require different medications and management strategies.  If you are indeed having focal seizures, the Topamax may not be the most appropriate medication.\n*   **Quality of Life:** Untreated or poorly managed seizures can significantly impact your quality of life.\n*   **Potential for Injury:** Some types of seizures can lead to falls or other injuries.\n*   **Medication Adjustments:** If you have seizures that are not being controlled, it is important to determine if your medication needs to be adjusted.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:**  You know your body best. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and insist on being heard. If you feel your concerns are being dismissed, politely but firmly reiterate your symptoms and concerns.\n*   **Bring a Support Person:** If possible, bring a friend or family member to your appointments. They can provide support, take notes, and help you remember important details.\n*   **Second Opinion:** Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another neurologist, even if it means traveling to see a specialist.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nYour GP appointment is a crucial step. Be prepared to clearly and thoroughly describe your symptoms, your concerns about your current diagnosis, and your need for a more comprehensive evaluation. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek the care you deserve. It is critical that you do not adjust your medication without your doctor's supervision. Good luck, and I hope you get the answers and treatment you need soon.\n"

Using my voice is exhausting, too.I have diabetes, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, digestive stuff and as of new, undiagnosed liver problems. Have an electromyography and heart tests coming.I can't stay sitting. I need to lie down all the time.Had an overdose couple days ago, if that matters.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thank you for providing that information.  Given your recent overdose, extensive medical history, and the severity of your current symptoms, *this is a serious situation that requires immediate medical attention.*  **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. I strongly urge you to contact emergency services (911 in the US) or go to the nearest emergency room right away.**\n\nHere's why this is critical and what the doctors will likely be concerned about:\n\n*   **Recent Overdose:** An overdose, regardless of the substance or intent, can have lasting effects on your body, potentially damaging organs (especially the liver and kidneys), disrupting neurological function, and causing electrolyte imbalances. The effects can linger for days and interact with your existing conditions.\n*   **Extreme Fatigue and Pain:**  The level of fatigue and widespread pain you describe is concerning.  It could be related to a number of things, including:\n    *   **Overdose Aftermath:**  Residual effects of the overdose are a strong possibility.\n    *   **Medication Interactions:**  The combination of Jardiance, insulin, Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), and any substances involved in the overdose can have complex interactions causing or worsening these symptoms.\n    *   **Electrolyte Imbalance:**  An overdose, diabetes, and digestive issues can all contribute to electrolyte imbalances (like potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium), which can cause fatigue, muscle weakness, and heart problems.\n    *   **Liver Problems:**  The newly diagnosed liver problems are particularly worrisome.  The liver is crucial for detoxification, and liver dysfunction can lead to fatigue, pain, and neurological symptoms.\n    *   **MS Flare:** It's possible you're experiencing an MS flare, which can be triggered by stress on the body.\n    *   **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS):** Given your diabetes, significant fatigue and weakness could indicate a serious blood sugar imbalance like DKA or HHS, especially after an overdose event.\n    *   **Infection:** The overdose may have compromised your immune system. An infection could also cause those symptoms.\n*   **Speech Difficulties and Exhaustion with Speaking:** This is a neurological symptom that needs to be evaluated immediately. It could be related to the overdose, MS, or other neurological complications.\n*   **Inability to Stay Sitting:**  This level of weakness is a red flag.\n\n**What to Tell the Emergency Room Staff:**\n\nWhen you get to the ER, be sure to tell them:\n\n*   **Everything** you told me, including your medications, diagnoses, and the fact that you had an overdose a few days ago. Be honest about what you took in the overdose.\n*   **All of your symptoms** \u2013 the fatigue, pain, difficulty speaking, inability to stay sitting, digestive issues.\n*   **That you have upcoming electromyography and heart tests.**\n*   **That you are concerned about a possible interaction of the overdose with your pre-existing conditions.**\n*   **That you have liver problems.**\n\n**Why Immediate Action is Necessary:**\n\nThe combination of your medical history, recent overdose, and the severity of your current symptoms suggests a potentially life-threatening situation.  Delays in treatment could lead to permanent organ damage, neurological complications, or even death.\n\nPlease, prioritize your health and seek emergency medical attention right now.  Your life may depend on it.\n"

    "question": "Age 35, Sex F, Height 5\u20192\u201d, Weight 135Trying to keep this short and sweet, but can provide infinite additional information/context if requested. I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse. So uh\u2026 yeah.Thoughts? Feelings? I briefly caught part of it on video, but have no idea how to post that here.I greatly appreciate any input.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds incredibly unsettling and frustrating, especially with the dismissive response from the neurologist. Let's break down the situation and potential considerations:\n\n**What You Experienced: A Detailed Summary**\n\n*   **Trigger:** Medium-mild pain at the top of your spine/base of skull. This could be a key piece of information.\n*   **Sequence of Events (Repeating Cyclically):**\n    *   Right eye involuntary closing/fluttering.\n    *   \"Out of body/near syncope/power flickering\" sensation. This is a crucial symptom that suggests neurological involvement.\n    *   Right leg spasms/shakes/jerks.\n    *   Tingling in both hands.\n*   **Progression:** The cycle grew longer and more intense over time, then resolved.\n*   **Later Development:** Right-sided facial twitching/numbness, speech difficulties, and leg weakness.\n*   **Cognitive Function:** You remained aware and able to interact (except during the most intense part of the \"out of body\" sensation).\n*   **Neurologist's Assessment:**\n    *   Based *solely* on a normal EEG, he diagnosed psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES).\n    *   Dismissed your concerns, attributing the episode to anxiety.\n    *   Suggested outpatient follow-up, downplaying the urgency.\n\n**Why the Neurologist's Diagnosis Might Be Insufficient (And Potentially Incorrect):**\n\n*   **Normal EEG Doesn't Exclude All Seizures or Neurological Events:** A single EEG, especially a short one, can easily miss seizure activity, especially if it's focal (localized) or occurs deep within the brain.  Furthermore, many neurological conditions *other* than seizures can cause these types of symptoms, and those would not necessarily show on an EEG.\n*   **The Sequence is Atypical for Typical Epileptic Seizures:** While seizures can manifest in various ways, the *specific, predictable, and repeating sequence* you describe is not classically characteristic of a typical epileptic seizure disorder. It points to a more specific neurological process.\n*   **Focal Neurological Deficits:** The right-sided eye closure, leg spasms, facial twitching/numbness, and leg weakness strongly suggest a *focal* neurological problem (meaning it's originating from a specific area in your brain).  While PNES can *mimic* focal symptoms, the rapid progression and consistent sequence should warrant a more thorough investigation.\n*   **The Trigger (Occipital Headache/Neck Pain):** The pain at the base of your skull/upper spine is critical. This location is close to the brainstem and cerebellum, and problems in this area can lead to a wide range of neurological symptoms.  It could be related to the other neurological findings or completely unrelated.\n*   **Underlying Medical History:** The enlarged right hilar lymph node is a significant piece of information. While the needle biopsy was negative, it doesn't rule out all possibilities. It raises questions about inflammation, infection, or even malignancy, all of which can potentially affect the nervous system.\n*   **Dismissal of Your Concerns:** The neurologist's dismissive attitude is inappropriate.  Doctors should listen carefully to patients, especially when describing unusual or concerning symptoms.\n\n**Potential Explanations and What Needs to Be Ruled Out:**\n\nGiven your symptoms and medical history, these possibilities need to be considered:\n\n1.  **Focal Seizures (Despite Normal EEG):** As mentioned above, a single EEG is not definitive.\n2.  **Cervical Spine/Brainstem Issue:** The headache/neck pain as a trigger strongly suggests a problem in this region.\n    *   **Chiari Malformation:** Structural defect where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal.\n    *   **Cervical Instability:** Problems with the ligaments in the neck leading to excessive movement and irritation of the spinal cord or brainstem.\n    *   **Cervical Stenosis:** Narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck.\n    *   **Vertebral Artery Dissection:** A tear in the wall of the vertebral artery, which can cause stroke-like symptoms.\n    *   **Tumor or Mass Effect:** Although less likely, a tumor or other mass in the brainstem or cerebellum could cause these symptoms.\n3.  **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Although the lymph node finding is not directly related to MS, the diverse neurological symptoms could fit, and a lesion in a specific location in the brain or spinal cord could explain the sequence.\n4.  **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** An inflammatory condition of the brain that can cause a wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.\n5.  **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** Rare disorders triggered by an abnormal immune system response to a cancerous tumor. Since you have an enlarged lymph node, this must be considered, though it is unlikely.\n6.  **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are many other rarer neurological conditions that could potentially explain your symptoms.\n\n**What You Should Do Now:**\n\n1.  **Document Everything:** Write down as much detail as possible about each episode: date, time, exact sequence of events, duration, triggers, and any other associated symptoms. Record videos if possible.\n2.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Do not accept the PNES diagnosis without further investigation.\n3.  **Demand Further Testing:** You need more comprehensive neurological evaluation, *especially* considering the sequence and the hilar lymph node. Insist on the following:\n    *   **Repeat EEG, Possibly Prolonged or Ambulatory:** A longer EEG increases the chances of capturing any seizure activity.  Consider an ambulatory EEG (EEG done at home over 24-72 hours).\n    *   **MRI of the Brain *with and without contrast*:** This is essential to rule out structural abnormalities, lesions, or inflammation.\n    *   **MRI of the Cervical Spine *with and without contrast*:** This is crucial to evaluate the possibility of a spinal cord problem or Chiari malformation, vertebral dissection, etc.\n    *   **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** To evaluate for infection, inflammation, or autoimmune encephalitis.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** A comprehensive set of blood tests to check for autoimmune markers, inflammatory markers, and other potential causes.\n    *   **Consider a Neurology Second Opinion.** If the daytime neurologist dismisses the situation as the night neurologist did, seek out a specialist at a large teaching hospital or university medical center, especially one with expertise in unusual neurological presentations.\n    *   **Pulmonary/Oncology Workup Re: Lymph Node:** Even though the biopsy was negative, ensure there's appropriate follow-up for the enlarged lymph node, especially if your symptoms persist.  Consider a repeat biopsy or other imaging studies if there's concern about underlying malignancy or infection.\n\n4.  **Be Persistent and Assertive:** Sadly, sometimes you have to advocate strongly for yourself to get the care you need. Don't be afraid to question the doctor's assessment and insist on further investigation.  Bring a friend or family member to appointments for support and to help you remember information.\n\n**In summary,** while psychogenic seizures are possible, the specific pattern, progression, focal neurological findings, and the associated head/neck pain, as well as the enlarged hilar lymph node warrant a much more thorough and aggressive investigation to rule out other serious neurological conditions. Don't let the initial dismissal discourage you from seeking the answers you deserve. It is very important to advocate for yourself.\n"

    "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about your son's recent head shaking and eye closing, especially given his history of tremors and a previous seizure.  It's definitely worth discussing these new behaviors with his neurologist as soon as possible.  Since I am an AI, I cannot give any medical advice. However, I can suggest some potential reasons for the behavior and ways to describe it when you talk to his doctor.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential causes and what to tell his neurologist:\n\n**Possible Causes (Discuss with Neurologist):**\n\n*   **Non-Epileptic Seizures/Events (NES):** Sometimes, events can look like seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. These can be triggered by psychological stress, anxiety, or other underlying conditions. Since the EEG didn't show epileptic activity, this could be considered, but it needs a thorough evaluation.\n\n*   **Tics:** Tics are sudden, repetitive movements or vocalizations. They can be simple (like eye blinking or head jerking) or complex (involving multiple movements). Tics can be associated with Tourette's syndrome or other tic disorders, but they can also occur in isolation.\n\n*   **Benign Shuddering Attacks:** These are brief, involuntary movements, often described as shivers or tremors. They typically start in infancy and resolve by early childhood. While he's had tremors before, these could be a new manifestation.\n\n*   **Sandifer Syndrome:** This is associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Infants may arch their backs, turn their heads, and stiffen their bodies in response to acid reflux. While less likely given his age and other history, it's worth considering if he has any feeding or digestive issues.\n\n*   **Vestibular Issues:** Problems with the inner ear (vestibular system) can cause dizziness and imbalance. The head shaking could be a way for him to compensate for these sensations.\n\n*   **Sensory Processing Issues:** Sometimes, children with sensory sensitivities may engage in repetitive behaviors to self-soothe or regulate their sensory input. The head shaking and eye closing could be a way for him to cope with overwhelming stimuli.\n\n*   **Teething:** While less likely in an older child, teething can still cause discomfort and irritability, which could manifest in unusual behaviors. It's less probable given his age and the specific description, but worth considering if he's also showing other teething signs.\n\n*   **New Type of Seizure:** While the initial EEG was negative, it doesn't completely rule out epilepsy. Seizures can sometimes be difficult to capture on EEG, especially if they are infrequent or originate in certain areas of the brain. This is the most important thing for the neurologist to consider.\n\n**What to Tell His Neurologist:**\n\n*   **Detailed Description of the Events:** Be as specific as possible.\n    *   \"He closes his eyes tightly and shakes his head from side to side, almost like he's tasted something very sour.\"\n    *   \"It looks like he is trying to shake something off.\"\n    *   \"The shaking is [gentle/vigorous/jerky].\"\n*   **Frequency and Duration:** How often does this happen, and how long does each episode last? (e.g., \"It happens several times a day, usually lasting only a few seconds.\")\n*   **Triggers:** Do you notice any specific situations or activities that seem to trigger the head shaking and eye closing? (e.g., \"It seems to happen more when he's tired,\" or \"It happens after he eats something sweet.\")\n*   **Associated Symptoms:** Does he have any other symptoms during or after the episodes? (e.g., \"He seems confused afterward,\" or \"He drools.\")\n*   **His Awareness During the Episodes:** Does he seem aware of his surroundings during the head shaking and eye closing, or does he seem \"out of it\"? (e.g., \"He stops what he's doing, but he seems to respond when I call his name,\" or \"He doesn't respond to me at all.\")\n*   **Video Recordings:** If possible, try to record an episode. This can be incredibly helpful for the neurologist to see exactly what's happening.\n*   **Medication/Allergies:** Confirm his neurologist has an updated list.\n*   **Your Concerns:** Don't hesitate to express your worries. Tell the neurologist that you're concerned about the possibility of seizures or other underlying medical conditions.\n\n**What To Do In The Meantime:**\n\n*   **Keep a Log:** Start a log of the episodes, noting the date, time, duration, triggers, and any associated symptoms. This will be valuable information for the neurologist.\n*   **Record Episodes:** As mentioned above, video recordings are extremely helpful.\n*   **Don't Panic, but Be Vigilant:** While it's important to take this seriously, try not to panic. Observe your son carefully and document everything.\n\nIt's great that you're proactive and seeking information. Remember, only his neurologist can properly diagnose and treat his condition. Good luck, and I hope you get answers soon!\n"

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand you're worried and want to understand your EEG report.  It's completely understandable that you're anxious, especially since your neurologist wants you to see an epilepsy specialist.  However, I want to be very clear: **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice or diagnosis. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional medical advice.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the EEG report seems to be saying, but remember, only the epilepsy specialist can give you a definitive interpretation:\n\n**Key Terms to Understand First:**\n\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** A test that measures electrical activity in the brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp.\n*   **19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar:** This describes the type of EEG and how it was performed. It means they used 19 electrodes placed on your scalp (arranged in a standard pattern on the convexity of your head), using a 24-channel machine capable of recording data in different ways (bipolar and monopolar).\n*   **At rest, with HV and under flickering light:**  The EEG was recorded while you were at rest, during hyperventilation (HV), and while exposed to flickering light. These are common activation methods to try and provoke abnormal brain activity, if present.\n*   **c/s:** cycles per second, which is a unit of frequency measurement (Hertz or Hz).\n*   **Background activity:** The normal electrical activity of the brain at rest.\n*   **Reactivity:** How the brain's electrical activity changes in response to stimuli (like opening and closing your eyes).\n*   **Dysrhythmia:** An abnormal rhythm in the brain's electrical activity.\n*   **Sharp wave complexes:** A specific type of abnormal brain wave that can sometimes be associated with epilepsy.\n*   **Activation signs:** Changes in the EEG that suggest abnormal brain activity is being triggered or amplified by the provocation methods (HV, flickering light).\n*   **Hyperventilation (HV):**  Deep, rapid breathing. It can sometimes trigger abnormal electrical activity in people prone to seizures.\n*   **Flickering Light (Photic Stimulation):**  Exposing the patient to a flashing light.  This can sometimes trigger abnormal electrical activity in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\n\n**Analysis of Your EEG Report (Based on the Translation):**\n\n1.  **\"In peace (At Rest): Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids.\"**\n\n    *   This suggests the normal background activity in the back of your brain (posterior regions, usually alpha waves) isn't perfectly stable. It's around 10 Hz, which is in the normal alpha range, but it has some irregularities (slower interrupting waves and some faster beta waves).\n    *   The activity spreads to other areas (centroparietal and temporal).\n    *   The *incomplete reactivity* to eye opening/closing could indicate a slight abnormality. Normally, alpha waves should decrease or disappear when you open your eyes.\n2.  **\"Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity.\"**\n    * The normal activity is observed predominately in the central and temporal brain areas and the frontal lobe shows low voltage readings.\n3.  **\"In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes.\"**\n\n    *   This is the most concerning part of the report.\n    *   *Discontinuous dysrhythmias* means there are abnormal rhythms happening, but not constantly.\n    *   The location is important: *left temporal mid-frontotemporal* (around the left side of your head, in the temporal and frontotemporal regions) and *front brain regions*.  The specific electrode locations (T3-F7, F3-FP1) help pinpoint the areas.\n    *   *Isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes* are the most suggestive of potential seizure activity. \"Rudimentary\" means they are not fully formed or classic sharp waves. \"Isolated\" means they are occurring infrequently. Sharp waves are abnormal brain waves that can be associated with epilepsy.\n4.  **\"Under flickering light: No activation signs.\"**\n\n    *   The flickering light didn't trigger any obvious abnormal activity. This *does not* rule out epilepsy, as not all people with epilepsy are photosensitive.\n5.  **\"Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.\"**\n\n    *   The hyperventilation made the previously seen abnormal activity (dysrhythmias) slightly more pronounced. This is a significant finding.\n\n**Overall Interpretation (with STRONG CAUTION):**\n\nThe EEG report suggests there *may* be some abnormal electrical activity in your brain, particularly in the left temporal and frontotemporal regions. The presence of dysrhythmias and rudimentary sharp wave complexes, especially with slight activation during hyperventilation, is what is likely prompting the referral to an epilepsy specialist. The fact that the flickering light didn't cause activation is somewhat reassuring, but doesn't exclude the possibility of epilepsy.\n\n**What This Means For You (Things to Keep in Mind):**\n\n*   **This is not a diagnosis.**  An EEG is just one piece of the puzzle. The epilepsy specialist will need to consider your symptoms, medical history, and potentially order more tests.\n*   **The abnormalities found don't automatically mean you have epilepsy.**  Some people can have abnormal EEG findings without having seizures. The specialist will need to determine if the EEG findings correlate with your symptoms.\n*   **\"Rudimentary\" and \"isolated\" are important words.** The fact that the sharp waves are not fully formed and are infrequent *could* mean they are less significant, but this needs to be assessed by the specialist.\n*   **The location of the abnormalities is relevant.** Temporal lobe epilepsy, for example, can cause a variety of symptoms, including some of the ones you described (fatigue, disorientation, cognitive difficulties, and strange feelings).\n*   **Don't panic.**  Seeing an epilepsy specialist is the right step. They can give you the most accurate assessment and discuss treatment options if necessary.\n\n**Questions to Ask the Epilepsy Specialist:**\n\n*   What is your interpretation of the EEG report?\n*   Do the EEG findings correlate with my symptoms?\n*   Do you think I have epilepsy? If not, what else could be causing my symptoms and the EEG abnormalities?\n*   What other tests (if any) do you recommend?\n*   What are the treatment options if I am diagnosed with epilepsy?\n*   What are the potential side effects of these treatments?\n*   What lifestyle changes (if any) should I make?\n*   What is the prognosis (long-term outlook)?\n*   Are there any support groups or resources you can recommend?\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **Do not self-diagnose or self-treat.**\n*   **Trust your healthcare professionals.**\n*   **Be patient.** It may take time to get a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n*   **Write down your symptoms and any questions you have before your appointment.**\n*   **Bring a friend or family member to your appointment for support and to help you remember information.**\n\nI hope this information is helpful.  I know it's a lot to process.  Try to stay calm and focus on getting the best possible care from the epilepsy specialist. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. It sounds like you have a good understanding of your medications and their potential interactions, which is excellent. You are right to be concerned about the potential risks, particularly the lowered seizure threshold.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns About Interactions & Seizure Risk:**\n\n*   **Trazodone + Wellbutrin + Adderall:** You're right, this combination is a valid concern. All three medications can individually lower the seizure threshold. When combined, the risk is amplified.\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:** This is not surprising, given the combination of medications you're on. Adderall and Wellbutrin can both affect blood pressure, and Trazodone is known to cause orthostatic hypotension. Dehydration and appetite suppression can certainly contribute to this as well.\n*   **Seizure Risk Assessment:** While you have no personal or family history of seizures, the combination of these medications does increase the risk. The degree of risk is difficult to quantify without a thorough individual assessment, but it's definitely something to be taken seriously.\n\n**Your Doctor's Advice to Double the Dose:**\n\n*   This is concerning. While your psychiatrist may have valid reasons based on your specific case and tolerance, doubling the dose of any of these medications, especially in combination, should be approached with extreme caution. This is especially true given the potential for increased side effects and seizure risk.\n\n**Recommendations and Questions for Your Psychiatrist:**\n\nGiven your concerns and the potential risks, here are some recommendations and questions you should discuss with your psychiatrist:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the Medication Regimen:**\n\n    *   **Alternatives to Trazodone:** Could you explore alternative medications for insomnia that don't have the same potential interactions with your other medications? Options could include:\n        *   **Mirtazapine:** Also an antidepressant but might be a safer option than trazodone.\n        *   **Doxepin:** TCA antidepressant that has been approved for insomnia.\n        *   **Ramelteon or Tasimelteon:** Melatonin receptor agonists that are not associated with the same seizure risk.\n        *   **Suvorexant or Lemborexant:** Orexin receptor antagonists that can be effective for insomnia.\n    *   **Klonopin Dependence:** Discuss the long-term use of Klonopin and the risk of dependence. Explore strategies to reduce your reliance on it for sleep, such as CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia).\n    *   **Review GAD Treatment:** Is your current approach to GAD optimal? Could other medications or therapies (like CBT) help you manage anxiety without relying solely on Klonopin?\n2.  **Investigate the Cause of Seizure Concerns:** I realize that my meds could lower the seizure threshold but with no h/o seizures in my family, what\u2019s the true risk given the benefit. I would ideally try something else before tapering off of something that has been working for years but if it came down to it, Trazodone is likely the culprit and first to go?\n3.  **Discuss the Justification for Doubling Doses:** Ask your psychiatrist to clarify why they suggested doubling doses and what factors they considered in making that recommendation. Express your concerns about the potential risks.\n4.  **Lifestyle Considerations:**\n    *   **Hydration:** Be very diligent about staying hydrated, especially given the orthostatic hypotension.\n    *   **Nutrition:** Ensure you're eating a balanced diet, even with a suppressed appetite.\n    *   **Sleep Hygiene:** Reinforce good sleep hygiene practices, even if you rely on medication.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Second Opinion:** If you remain concerned about your psychiatrist's approach, consider seeking a second opinion from another psychiatrist, especially one with expertise in psychopharmacology.\n*   **Honesty is Key:** Be completely honest with your psychiatrist about all medications, supplements, and substances you are using.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a medical professional, and this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It is essential to discuss your concerns and potential medication changes with your psychiatrist or another qualified healthcare provider.\n"

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with Ped Mal seizures since I was young. It has been triggered at times due to various reasons however those reasons have never been gaming. I ran into a game that gave a warning for Photosensitive epilepsy for its intense flashing however I play many games that have intense flashing but haven't had a episode. I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your situation. You have a history of petit mal seizures (now more commonly referred to as absence seizures), you're currently well-controlled on 250mg of lamotrigine, and you're wondering if it's safe to play a specific game that carries a photosensitive epilepsy warning, even though you've played similar games without issue.\n\nGiven that I am not a medical professional I can not advise you whether to play that game or not. However, I can give you points to consider and some general recommendations:\n\n**Factors to Consider:**\n\n*   **Type of Seizure:** You mention a history of petit mal seizures. While photosensitive epilepsy is more commonly associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal), it *can* still trigger absence seizures in some individuals.\n\n*   **Medication Effectiveness:** The fact that you haven't had a seizure since starting lamotrigine is a very positive sign. It indicates good seizure control.\n\n*   **Individual Sensitivity:** Everyone's sensitivity to flashing lights and patterns is different. What triggers one person may not trigger another. You've played similar games without issue, which suggests a certain level of tolerance.\n\n*   **Intensity of Flashing:** The specific game's warning is important. Is it a general warning, or does it specifically mention very rapid or intense flashing patterns? The more intense the flashing, the greater the potential risk.\n\n*   **Other Triggers:** Are there any other potential triggers present in the game, such as stress, sleep deprivation (if you play for long periods), or dehydration?\n\n*   **Duration of Exposure:** Shorter periods of exposure to flashing lights are generally less risky than longer periods.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Neurologist:** This is the *most important* recommendation. Talk to your neurologist about this specific game. They know your medical history best and can provide personalized advice based on your seizure type, medication, and overall health. Tell them about the game, the warning, and your previous experiences with similar games.\n\n2.  **Gradual Exposure and Self-Monitoring:** If your neurologist gives you the okay to try the game, proceed with caution.\n    *   **Start Slowly:** Play for a very short period (e.g., 10-15 minutes) in a well-lit room.\n    *   **Monitor Yourself Closely:** Pay attention to how you feel. Look for any warning signs of a seizure, such as:\n        *   Staring spells\n        *   Jerking movements\n        *   Changes in awareness\n        *   Headache\n        *   Nausea\n        *   Visual disturbances\n    *   **Stop Immediately:** If you experience any of these symptoms, stop playing the game immediately.\n\n3.  **Environmental Adjustments:**\n    *   **Well-Lit Room:** Play the game in a well-lit room to reduce the contrast between the screen and the surroundings.\n    *   **Distance from Screen:** Sit further away from the screen.\n    *   **Take Breaks:** Take frequent breaks to rest your eyes and avoid prolonged exposure.\n    *   **Screen Settings:** Explore the game's settings to see if there are options to reduce flashing or adjust brightness and contrast. Some games offer accessibility features for photosensitive epilepsy.\n\n4.  **General Health:**\n    *   **Adequate Sleep:** Ensure you get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation can increase seizure risk.\n    *   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water.\n    *   **Manage Stress:** Avoid playing the game when you're feeling stressed or anxious.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **\"Better Safe Than Sorry\":** If you have any doubts or concerns, it's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid the game.\n*   **Don't Ignore Symptoms:** Even if you've played similar games before without issue, don't ignore any potential symptoms. Your sensitivity may change over time.\n*   **Inform Others:** Let someone you trust know that you're playing the game and that you have a history of seizures. This way, they can be aware and assist you if needed.\n\n**In summary, while your current seizure control is encouraging, it's crucial to consult with your neurologist for personalized advice regarding this specific game. Proceed with caution, monitor yourself closely, and prioritize your health and safety.**\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Remember, I am not a medical professional, and this is not a substitute for medical advice. Always consult with your doctor or neurologist for any health concerns.\n"

    "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is something you absolutely need to discuss with a doctor as soon as possible. I cannot diagnose you, but I can help you understand why your symptoms are concerning and what questions to ask your doctor.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why your symptoms are concerning and what needs to be investigated:\n\n*   **Unresponsive Spells:** These \"blanking out\" spells are concerning. The fact that you're aware of your surroundings but unable to respond is significant. This could indicate a disruption in brain activity.\n\n*   **Twitching and Jerking:** The arm and neck twitching/jerking following the blanking out is also important. These movements could be a type of seizure activity, even if brief. Your existing motor tics further complicate the picture, as it's important to differentiate these from seizure activity.\n\n*   **Triggers:** The fact that these spells are more frequent with alcohol and disrupted sleep is very telling. Both alcohol and sleep deprivation can lower the seizure threshold in individuals who are predisposed to seizures.\n\n*   **Family History:** The fact that your cousin has had grand mal seizures after drinking is a significant red flag. Epilepsy can have a genetic component.\n\n*   **ASD and Potential Comorbidities:** People with ASD are known to have a higher risk of also having epilepsy than neurotypical people.\n\n**Why This Could Be Epilepsy (or Something Else):**\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** The combination of unresponsiveness, twitching/jerking, and family history strongly suggests the possibility of epilepsy. The type of seizure you might be experiencing could be a focal seizure (also called a partial seizure), which can manifest in a variety of ways, including altered awareness, motor symptoms, and sensory changes. You remain conscious during focal seizures. If your cousin has generalized seizures, it doesn't mean you have the same kind.\n\n*   **Other Possibilities:** It's important to remember that other conditions can mimic epilepsy. These include:\n\n    *   **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is fainting due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. However, the twitching and jerking are less typical with syncope.\n    *   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These seizures look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are often related to psychological factors.\n    *   **Other Neurological Conditions:** Less likely, but other neurological disorders could potentially cause similar symptoms.\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor IMMEDIATELY:** This is not something to wait on. Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or, ideally, a neurologist. Tell them about all your symptoms, triggers, and family history.\n\n2.  **Be Specific and Detailed:** When you see the doctor, be as specific as possible about:\n    *   The nature of the \"blanking out\" spells: How long do they last? What do you experience?\n    *   The twitching/jerking: Where does it occur? What is it like?\n    *   The triggers: How much alcohol do you drink? How often? What is your typical sleep schedule? How often do you use cannabis?\n    *   Your ASD diagnosis and any current treatments.\n\n3.  **Ask About Testing:** Your doctor will likely recommend some or all of the following tests:\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This test measures brainwave activity and can help identify abnormal electrical patterns associated with seizures. You may want to ask if they have the capability for ambulatory EEG monitoring, allowing the test to take place over an extended period of time.\n    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain:** This imaging test can help rule out structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing seizures.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To rule out other medical conditions.\n\n4.  **Document Your Episodes:** Keep a detailed log of your episodes, including the date, time, duration, symptoms, and any potential triggers. This information will be very helpful for your doctor.\n\n5.  **Consider Reducing or Eliminating Triggers:** While you wait for your appointment, consider reducing or eliminating alcohol and cannabis use, and prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, you may need to temporarily or permanently stop driving. Check your local laws regarding driving with epilepsy.\n*   **Safety:** Discuss safety precautions with your doctor, such as avoiding activities that could be dangerous if you were to have a seizure (e.g., swimming alone, climbing ladders).\n*   **Medication:** If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, you may need to take anti-seizure medication. It's important to take this medication exactly as prescribed.\n\n**You are not overthinking.** These symptoms warrant medical attention. The fact that you are concerned and seeking information is a good thing. Take action now and see a doctor as soon as possible.\n"

    "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

    "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a very concerning and complex situation, and it's absolutely valid for you to seek guidance. Let's break down the information you've provided and discuss the next steps.\n\n**Summary of Your Situation**\n\n*   **Demographics:** 19F, 120 lbs\n*   **Diagnoses:** Anxiety, Depression, Hyperhidrosis (4 years)\n*   **Medications:**\n    *   Bupropion (200mg twice daily, 4 years)\n    *   Buspirone (5mg twice daily, since April 2023)\n    *   Hydroxyzine (25-75mg PRN)\n    *   Glycopyrrolate (2mg)\n*   **Substance Use:** Recreational Marijuana (4x/week, past year)\n*   **Potential Seizure Events:** Multiple episodes since August 5th with varying symptoms including:\n    *   \"Electric shock\" sensation\n    *   Sudden anger and altered awareness\n    *   Repetitive childhood imagery\n    *   Slowed speech\n    *   Nausea/vomiting\n    *   Droopy eyelids\n    *   Preceding symptoms like anxiety, chest pressure, fatigue, disorganized thoughts\n*   **Other Symptoms:**\n    *   Frequent headaches/migraines\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Decreased exercise tolerance\n    *   Weight loss (20 lbs in the last year)\n    *   Vitamin D deficiency (mild)\n\n**Analysis and Considerations**\n\n1.  **Potential Seizures:** Your description of the events, particularly the \"electric shock\" feeling, altered awareness, repetitive thoughts, and post-event confusion, is concerning for possible focal seizures. Focal seizures can present with a wide range of symptoms depending on the brain area affected. While the symptoms may seem \"different\" in each episode, that is normal, it does not mean you are not having seizures.\n\n2.  **Differential Diagnoses:** It's crucial to consider other potential causes for your symptoms.\n\n    *   **Migraine Aura:** The visual changes and sensory disturbances you experience could be related to migraine aura. However, migraine auras typically don't include the specific types of altered awareness, motor symptoms, or repetitive thoughts you described. Also, migraine aura does not cause repetitive thoughts.\n    *   **Anxiety/Panic Attacks:** While anxiety can cause a variety of physical and psychological symptoms, the described episodes seem distinct from typical panic attacks, especially given the altered awareness and repetitive thoughts. Also, panic attacks typically do not cause repetitive thoughts.\n    *   **Side Effects of Medications:**\n        *   *Bupropion:* While less common, bupropion *can* lower the seizure threshold, meaning it can make someone more susceptible to seizures, especially at higher doses.\n        *   *Buspirone:* Buspirone is generally well-tolerated, but some people experience dizziness or confusion.\n        *   *Hydroxyzine:* Can cause drowsiness and confusion, but this is typically when it's actively working in your system after taking it.\n        *   *Glycopyrrolate:* Can cause dizziness or confusion.\n    *   **Marijuana Use:** Marijuana can affect people differently and can sometimes trigger anxiety, panic, or altered perceptions. It's unlikely to be the sole cause of the described events, but it could potentially play a role.\n\n3.  **Is it possible you are faking it?:** It is extremely difficult to purposefully elicit these symptoms, and it is unlikely you are faking or making it up for attention. There is no \"benefit\" to having a seizure, and you may be struggling with imposter syndrome. Based on everything you have said, these are true symptoms.\n\n4.  **Other Contributing Factors:**\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Being very tired can trigger seizures or exacerbate other neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Diet:** You mentioned that eating fatty/sugary foods seems to trigger episodes. This is very possible, and it would be a good idea to start paying attention to what you eat and how you are feeling/potential episodes.\n    *   **Vitamin D Deficiency:** While mild, vitamin D deficiency can contribute to fatigue and mood changes.\n    *   **Weight Loss and Decreased Exercise Tolerance:** These are concerning and should be investigated further. Weight loss can happen with seizures, especially if there is some underlying digestive reason for having seizures. It can also be caused from many other things, like hormone imbalances.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **See a Neurologist Immediately:** *This is the most important step.* You need a thorough neurological evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms. Tell them everything you have told me here. The neurologist will likely order the following:\n\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To look for abnormal brain activity.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** To rule out any structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for other potential causes (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, infections).\n\n2.  **Document Your Episodes:** Keep a detailed log of your episodes, including:\n\n    *   Date and time\n    *   What you were doing before the event\n    *   Specific symptoms\n    *   Duration of the event\n    *   Any potential triggers (food, stress, sleep deprivation, etc.)\n    *   Medications/substances you took that day\n\n3.  **Medication Review:** Discuss your medications with your doctor, particularly bupropion, to assess whether it might be contributing to your symptoms. Do not stop taking any medications without first talking to your doctor.\n\n4.  **Consider Reducing Marijuana Use:** While it may not be the primary cause, reducing or temporarily stopping marijuana use could help clarify whether it's playing a role in your symptoms.\n\n5.  **Address Sleep Deprivation:** Prioritize getting adequate sleep.\n\n6.  **Dietary Changes:** Monitor your diet to see if you can identify specific triggers and try to eat regular, balanced meals.\n\n7.  **Monitor Other Symptoms:** Be vigilant about your other symptoms (dizziness, headaches, weight loss, decreased exercise tolerance) and report them to your doctor.\n\n8.  **Don't Downplay Your Concerns:** It's common to question yourself, but trust your gut. Your girlfriend's observations, your own experiences, and the patterns you've noticed are all valid.\n\n9.  **Ask for Support:** Lean on your girlfriend, friends, or family for support. Dealing with this uncertainty can be challenging.\n\n**Specific Questions to Consider and Discuss with Your Doctor**\n\n*   Could these events be focal seizures?\n*   Is bupropion potentially lowering my seizure threshold?\n*   Could my other medications be contributing?\n*   What specific tests do you recommend?\n*   What are the other possible causes for my symptoms?\n*   What should I do if I have another episode?\n\n**Important Note:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute medical advice. It's essential to see a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn summary, your symptoms warrant a thorough medical evaluation, particularly by a neurologist. The possibility of focal seizures needs to be investigated, and other potential causes need to be ruled out. Documenting your episodes and discussing your concerns openly with your doctor will be crucial in getting to the bottom of this. You're doing the right thing by seeking answers and advocating for your health. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with EA2 after an unexpected hospital stay. Of course I have been researching the condition, and came across 4-AP. I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won\u2019t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn\u2019t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're in a challenging situation. Being diagnosed with EA2 can be overwhelming, and it's frustrating when you feel your healthcare provider isn't fully addressing your concerns. It's completely valid to want to explore all available treatment options, especially when your current regimen has drawbacks. Let's break down the situation and consider some possible steps you could take:\n\n**Understanding Your Concerns:**\n\n*   **Limited Information from Neurologist:** It's concerning that your neurologist is hesitant to discuss 4-AP or explain their reasoning. Open communication is crucial for effective treatment.\n*   **Prednisone Dependence:** You're worried about the long-term effects of prednisone and the need to increase the dosage during episodes. It is well known that long term steroid use can lead to many dangerous side effects.\n*   **Desire for 4-AP:** You're interested in 4-AP (Ampyra or Fampyra) as a potential alternative or adjunct treatment, hoping to reduce or eliminate your prednisone use.\n*   **Movement Clinic Access:** The lack of affordable, accessible movement disorder specialists is a significant barrier.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns: Possible Steps You Can Take**\n\n1.  **Advocate for Open Communication with Your Neurologist:**\n\n    *   **Schedule a Dedicated Appointment:** Request an appointment specifically to discuss your treatment plan and your interest in 4-AP.

This is especially crucial with medications like prednisone and 4-AP.\n*   **Honesty and Transparency:** Be honest with your doctor about your concerns, research, and treatment goals. The more information you share, the better they can understand your needs.\n*   **Patient Advocacy Groups:** Connect with patient advocacy groups for EA2 or other cerebellar ataxias. They can provide valuable information, support, and resources. The National Ataxia Foundation (NAF) is a great resource.\n*   **Legal Considerations:** There are laws that help patients to get the medications they need.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *This information is for general guidance only and should not be considered medical advice. It is essential to consult with your doctor or other qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.*\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nDealing with a chronic condition like EA2 requires a proactive approach. It's important to be informed, advocate for yourself, and work collaboratively with your healthcare providers to find the most effective and sustainable treatment plan. Don't hesitate to seek second opinions or explore alternative options if you feel your current treatment isn't meeting your needs.\n"

    "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ? I feel flooded by these emotions, I cry.Then it took like 15 minutes to come back to normal, I am in a very confused state and go back to sleep.Any idea what was that ?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "That sounds like a terrifying and disorienting experience. Based on your description, here are a few possible explanations, keeping in mind that I am an AI and this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. **It is crucial to consult a doctor to discuss your experience.**\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n*   **Sleep Inertia:** This is a period of grogginess, disorientation, and impaired cognitive performance that can occur upon waking, especially after being woken up abruptly from deep sleep. While sleep inertia is common, your description of the intensity and specific symptoms (like the inability to form complex thoughts, the feeling of thoughts being erased, and the silent inner voice) is more pronounced than what is typically experienced.\n\n*   **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** These are hallucinations that occur while falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic). They can be visual, auditory, or even involve sensations of movement or touch. While hallucinations are often thought of as visual, the feeling of thoughts \"erasing\" or \"not being yours\" could be interpreted as a form of hallucination affecting your sense of self and cognition.\n\n*   **Panic Attack/Anxiety Episode:** While you mentioned feeling panic, it's possible that you were experiencing a severe panic attack that manifested in a unique way. Panic attacks can sometimes cause feelings of derealization (feeling detached from reality) and depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself), which could explain the feeling of thoughts not being your own.\n\n*   **Migraine Aura:** Some people experience auras before or during migraines. These auras can manifest in various ways, including visual disturbances, sensory changes, and even cognitive difficulties like trouble thinking or speaking clearly.\n\n*   **Dissociative Episode:** Dissociation is a mental process that can cause a person to feel disconnected from their thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity.  While often associated with trauma, dissociative episodes can sometimes occur in response to stress or anxiety. Your experience of feeling like your thoughts weren't your own and the sense of losing control of your thinking could indicate dissociation.\n\n*   **Neurological Event:** Although less likely, it's important to consider the possibility of a neurological event. Given the unusual nature of your symptoms, it is imperative to discuss it with your doctor.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Recurrence:** Has this happened before? If so, how often? Knowing the frequency and duration of these episodes will be helpful for diagnosis.\n*   **Triggers:** Can you identify any triggers that might have preceded this experience? Stress, lack of sleep, diet changes, medication changes, or other factors could be contributing.\n*   **Medical History:** Do you have any underlying medical conditions, particularly neurological or psychological conditions? Do you take any medications?\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor:** The most important step is to consult a doctor to discuss your experience. They can perform a physical exam, take your medical history, and order any necessary tests (e.g., blood work, neurological exam, brain imaging) to rule out underlying medical conditions.\n2.  **Keep a Sleep Diary:** Track your sleep patterns, including bedtime, wake-up time, sleep quality, and any unusual experiences you have during the night.\n3.  **Mental Health Professional:** A therapist or psychiatrist can assess your mental health and help you explore any potential anxiety, panic, or dissociative disorders.\n\nThe fact that you were able to regain your cognitive function and emotional regulation suggests that this may have been a transient episode. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause and prevent future occurrences. Do not hesitate to reach out to your doctor as soon as possible.\n"

    "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the likely scenario regarding your blood tests with the switch to Keppra and Topamax, and why the initial uncertainty.\n\n**Understanding the Shift in Monitoring**\n\n*   **Tegretol (Carbamazepine) Concerns:** Tegretol is primarily metabolized by the liver. That's why Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are crucial when on it. Elevated LFTs indicate potential liver damage or stress, a common concern with many AEDs. The fact that your LFTs were high was a significant factor in changing your medication.\n*   **Keppra (Levetiracetam) and Topamax (Topiramate) Concerns:** These medications are primarily cleared by the kidneys. Therefore, monitoring kidney function becomes more important than liver function.\n\n**Why the Initial Uncertainty?**\n\nThe lack of clarity from your specialists could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1.  **Titration Period:** Early on in the switch, the priority may have been stabilization on the new medications. Sometimes, doctors wait until the patient is on a stable dose before initiating regular bloodwork. They might have been waiting to see how you responded clinically.\n2.  **Protocol Differences:** Different clinics or neurologists have varying protocols for monitoring AEDs. Some are more conservative than others.\n3.  **Monitoring History:** Given your history of elevated LFTs with Tegretol, they *might* have considered continuing to monitor them initially to ensure no carryover effects. This is less likely in the long run.\n4.  **Unsure about baseline data:** They may not know if you have any other health conditions\n\n**Likely Blood Testing Scenario**\n\nHere's how it's likely to play out, based on typical practice:\n\n1.  **Renal Panel (Kidney Function Test) is Highly Likely:** This is the most crucial test given that Keppra and Topamax are cleared by the kidneys. A renal panel typically includes:\n    *   **Creatinine:** A waste product filtered by the kidneys. Elevated creatinine indicates impaired kidney function.\n    *   **eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):** Calculated from creatinine levels, this estimates how well your kidneys are filtering blood.\n    *   **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen):** Another waste product filtered by the kidneys. Elevated BUN can also indicate kidney problems.\n    *   **Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Bicarbonate, Calcium, Phosphate):** These are vital for many bodily functions, and the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating them. Kidney dysfunction can cause electrolyte imbalances.\n\n2.  **CBC (Complete Blood Count/FBC):** This is a fairly standard test that provides information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It may be done periodically, but it's less directly related to Keppra and Topamax monitoring than the renal panel. Some AEDs can affect blood cell production, so monitoring this is generally good practice.\n\n3.  **LFTs (Liver Function Tests):** While less crucial than with Tegretol, *some* monitoring of LFTs is possible, particularly if you have a history of liver issues. It's less likely to be as frequent as the renal panel. They might check it initially to make sure the transition is smooth. Some neurologists do annual LFTs regardless of the AED being used.\n\n4.  **Therapeutic Drug Level Monitoring (Keppra and Topamax):** This is *possible* but less common than with some other AEDs, *especially* early in the process. These drugs often aren't as tightly controlled by serum levels. However, it might be done:\n    *   If you are experiencing breakthrough seizures.\n    *   If there are concerns about adherence (taking your medication as prescribed).\n    *   If you are taking other medications that might interact with Keppra or Topamax.\n    *   If you have any other health conditions that may impact the drugs.\n\n**How it Might Play Out in Practice:**\n\n*   **Initial Monitoring:** They might order a renal panel, CBC, and LFTs to get a baseline assessment.\n*   **Frequency:** Renal panels might be done more frequently initially (e.g., every 3-6 months) and then less often once your kidney function is stable (e.g., annually).\n*   **Communication:** The most important thing is to *specifically ask* your neurologist *why* they are ordering each test and what they are looking for. This will help you understand the monitoring process and address any concerns you have.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Call the office:** Call your neurologist's office and ask for clarification on which tests will be ordered and the frequency of monitoring. You have a right to understand why these tests are being done.\n2.  **Document Your Questions:** Write down your questions before the appointment.\n3.  **Be Persistent:** If you are not satisfied with the answers you receive, politely but firmly reiterate your need for clarification.\n4.  **Get a Copy of Your Results:** Always ask for a copy of your blood test results. This will allow you to track your values over time and become more informed about your health.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Other Medications:** Be sure your neurologist is aware of *all* medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. These can potentially interact with Keppra and Topamax and affect kidney function.\n*   **Hydration:** Staying well-hydrated is generally good for kidney health, especially when taking medications that are cleared through the kidneys.\n*   **Report Symptoms:** Immediately report any new or worsening symptoms to your neurologist, such as changes in urination, swelling, fatigue, or confusion.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult with your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations regarding your specific medical condition and treatment plan.\n"

Should I see my neurologist or GP about this It\u2019s been happening for about 2 months now, I think I have Blepharospasm in my left eye, could this be related to my epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your complex medical history, which includes bipolar disorder, epilepsy (specifically partial seizures), OCD, ASD, and the medication regimen you are currently on, it's important to take this new symptom seriously. The sudden onset of your left eye sticking closed multiple times a day warrants medical attention.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you should seek medical advice and who to see:\n\n**Why you should seek medical advice:**\n\n*   **New Neurological Symptom:** This is a new symptom that you have noticed and that persists over time. Since you are already diagnosed with seizures and other neurological conditions, this symptom needs to be taken seriously as it could be related to your epilepsy.\n*   **Possible Epilepsy-Related Symptom:** Given your epilepsy diagnosis, it's possible this eye twitching could be related to seizure activity, even if it doesn't resemble your usual partial seizures. Epilepsy symptoms can change or evolve.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** Some of the medications you are taking can have neurological side effects. While less likely given the time frame, it is something that can be ruled out.\n*   **Possible Blepharospasm:** The possibility of blepharospasm is a reasonable consideration, but it's important to rule out other potential causes first.\n*   **Impact on Daily Life:** Even if benign, eye twitching can be disruptive and affect your quality of life.\n\n**Who you should see:**\n\n*   **Neurologist:** Your neurologist is the primary specialist to consult, especially since you have a history of epilepsy.\n*   They can assess whether this new symptom is related to your seizure disorder, medication, or a different neurological condition.\n*   Your neurologist can perform an examination to rule out potential causes, and/ or recommend additional testing such as an EEG to evaluate your brain activity.\n\n**Is Blepharospasm related to epilepsy?**\n\n*   It is possible that blepharospasm can be related to epilepsy or seizures, though this is less common and not necessarily always the cause. It is important to have this symptom investigated by your neurologist.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   Document the episodes: Start a log of when the eye twitching occurs, how long it lasts, and any triggers or associated symptoms (e.g., stress, fatigue, etc.). This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n*   Medication List: Bring a complete list of all your medications and dosages to your appointment.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nThis information should not replace the advice of a qualified physician. Please consult with your neurologist or primary care provider for advice.\n"

    "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a very stressful situation, and I understand your desire to act quickly and gather as much information as possible. Let's break down the information you're asking about:\n\n**1. 23andMe and Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC)**\n\n*   **Limited Coverage:** 23andMe (and similar direct-to-consumer genetic testing kits) **do NOT comprehensively test for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).** They are designed to identify common genetic variants linked to ancestry, some common diseases, and traits. They are *screening tools*, not diagnostic tools.\n\n*   **Why not?** TSC is caused by mutations in the *TSC1* and *TSC2* genes. There are *thousands* of different possible mutations in these genes that can lead to TSC. 23andMe tests typically look at a very limited number of specific SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), not full gene sequencing, so they won't catch most TSC-causing mutations.\n\n*   **Could a 23andMe report *hint* at something?** In extremely rare cases, a 23andMe report might coincidentally identify a variant in or near *TSC1* or *TSC2*. However, this would be an *extremely* unlikely scenario, and even if it did, it would **require follow-up confirmatory testing by a clinical genetics lab.** You can't rely on it for any kind of meaningful screening.\n\n*   **Bottom Line:**  **Do not use 23andMe as a way to screen for TSC.** It's not designed for that purpose and will likely give you a false sense of security (if negative) or unnecessary anxiety (if a vaguely related variant is found).\n\n**2. What you SHOULD do:**\n\n*   **Focus on the EEG:** Your primary concern should be getting the EEG done ASAP. You are right to be concerned about infantile spasms and West syndrome.  The EEG is the key diagnostic tool. You are making a very wise decision to try and expedite this.\n*   **Consult with a Pediatric Neurologist:** After the EEG, or even before, it is critical to consult with a pediatric neurologist who has experience with infantile spasms and West syndrome. They can interpret the EEG results, determine the correct course of treatment (if needed), and discuss the possibility of TSC.\n*   **Genetic Counseling and Testing (if indicated):** If your son is diagnosed with infantile spasms, especially if the cause is unclear after initial investigations, discuss genetic testing for TSC with the pediatric neurologist.  They can order the appropriate clinical-grade genetic tests from specialized labs.  This testing will involve sequencing the *TSC1* and *TSC2* genes (and possibly others) to look for disease-causing mutations.\n*   **Clinical Evaluation for TSC:**  Even before genetic testing, a thorough clinical evaluation for signs of TSC is important. This involves careful skin examination (looking for hypopigmented macules - \"ash leaf spots\"), eye examination (looking for retinal hamartomas), and monitoring for other potential signs (cardiac rhabdomyomas on echocardiogram, kidney angiomyolipomas on ultrasound/MRI, etc.). However, keep in mind that many of these signs may not be apparent in a 6-month-old, which is why ongoing monitoring is crucial.\n*   **Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of your son's development, any seizures or suspected spasms, doctor's appointments, test results, and any concerns you have.\n\n**3. Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Early Intervention:** You are absolutely correct that early diagnosis and treatment of infantile spasms are critical for improving long-term outcomes.\n*   **Not All Infantile Spasms = West Syndrome = TSC:** It's important to remember that infantile spasms have many potential causes. West syndrome is a specific *syndrome* characterized by infantile spasms, a specific EEG pattern called hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression. TSC is just one possible cause of West syndrome. Many cases of infantile spasms are idiopathic (no known cause).\n\n**In summary:** While your desire to get information about TSC is understandable, 23andMe is not the right tool for this. Focus on getting the EEG, consulting with a pediatric neurologist, and having a thorough clinical evaluation of your son. If indicated, the neurologist can order appropriate genetic testing from a clinical lab. I sincerely hope you get answers and effective treatment for your son soon.  This is a tough time, and I wish you all the best.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

    "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand you're experiencing a cluster of symptoms that seem to be linked to your menstrual cycle and are concerned it might be catamenial epilepsy.  It's important to remember I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  You NEED to discuss this with a doctor.  However, I can break down the information you've provided and explain why it's important to seek professional medical evaluation.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of your symptoms and potential concerns:**\n\n*   **Back Stiffness/Tightness:** This could be muscle tension related to hormonal changes, stress, or even referred pain from other issues.\n*   **Head \"Waves\":** This is a concerning symptom. Describing it as \"waves\" suggests a neurological component. It could be related to migraine aura, changes in blood pressure, or even a seizure.\n*   **Tingling in Arms and Legs:** This could be related to Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), nerve compression, anxiety, hyperventilation (leading to changes in blood pH), or, again, neurological issues.\n*   **Heart \"Weirdness\" and Breathing Difficulties:** This is concerning and needs immediate medical attention. The feeling of having to consciously force yourself to breathe, and the pauses in breathing, are signs of possible respiratory distress or neurological interference with breathing control.  The \"weird\" heart sensation needs investigation to rule out cardiac arrhythmias.\n*   **Passing Out:** This indicates a loss of consciousness, which could be related to a drop in blood pressure, a cardiac event, a seizure, or other serious conditions.\n*   **Confusion:** Confusion after passing out is common, but it's important to note the duration and severity.\n*   **Cycle-Related Pattern:** This is a KEY piece of information. The fact that these symptoms are linked to your menstrual cycle strongly suggests a hormonal influence.\n*   **Ibuprofen Relief:** The partial relief with ibuprofen might suggest that inflammation plays a role, but it doesn't rule out other underlying causes.\n*   **Ativan Relief:** Ativan (lorazepam) is a benzodiazepine, which has anti-anxiety, muscle-relaxant, and anti-seizure properties.  Its effectiveness suggests that anxiety, muscle tension, or even seizure activity could be contributing factors.\n*   **Esophageal Tear:** An esophageal tear (likely a Mallory-Weiss tear) from forceful vomiting is a serious complication.  This indicates the vomiting was very severe and prolonged.\n*   **Groaning/Mumbling:** This could be a sign of seizure activity, altered mental status, or a sleep disorder.\n\n**Could it be Catamenial Epilepsy?**\n\nCatamenial epilepsy refers to seizures that are triggered or exacerbated by hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle. While your symptoms have some overlap with possible seizure activity, it's essential to get a proper diagnosis from a doctor. Not all seizures involve convulsions or loss of consciousness. Some seizures can manifest as altered sensations, confusion, or automatisms (like mumbling or groaning).\n\n**Why you MUST see a doctor:**\n\n1.  **Rule out other conditions:** Your symptoms could be caused by a variety of medical conditions, including:\n    *   **Cardiovascular issues:** Arrhythmias, vasovagal syncope (fainting), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).\n    *   **Neurological issues:** Migraines (especially with aura), transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), other seizure disorders, or even functional neurological disorder (FND).\n    *   **Hormonal imbalances:** Beyond just epilepsy, other hormonal imbalances could be contributing.\n    *   **Anxiety disorders:** Panic attacks and anxiety can sometimes mimic other medical conditions.\n    *   **Sleep disorders:** Sleep apnea could explain the breathing pauses.\n2.  **Diagnosis:** Only a doctor can properly diagnose your condition based on your medical history, a physical exam, and appropriate tests.\n3.  **Treatment:** Once diagnosed, a doctor can recommend the most effective treatment plan. Catamenial epilepsy, if that's what it is, is often managed with hormonal therapies or anti-seizure medications.\n4.  **Safety:** Your breathing difficulties and loss of consciousness are potentially life-threatening. You need to understand the cause and receive appropriate treatment to prevent future episodes.\n\n**What to do NOW:**\n\n1.  **Schedule an appointment with your doctor IMMEDIATELY.**  Tell them about all of your symptoms and their relationship to your menstrual cycle.\n2.  **Keep a detailed symptom diary:**  Record the date, time, specific symptoms, duration, and anything that seemed to trigger or relieve them.  Note the timing in relation to your menstrual cycle.\n3.  **Consider seeing a neurologist:**  If your doctor suspects a neurological issue, they may refer you to a neurologist.\n4.  **Ask about testing:**  Your doctor may order tests such as:\n    *   **EEG (electroencephalogram):** To look for seizure activity in the brain. Ideally, this would be done around the time you typically experience symptoms.\n    *   **EKG/Holter monitor:** To monitor your heart rhythm.\n    *   **Blood tests:** To check hormone levels, electrolytes, and other factors.\n    *   **MRI of the brain:** To rule out structural abnormalities.\n5.  **If you experience severe symptoms again, go to the emergency room.** Don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if you feel your breathing is compromised or you lose consciousness.\n\nIt's understandable that you're concerned and seeking answers, but please prioritize seeing a doctor. They are the only ones who can give you a definitive diagnosis and guide you toward the right treatment. Good luck!\n"

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. Based on the information you've provided, here's a summary of the situation and some considerations for you:\n\n**Summary of Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Swollen, Painful Occipital Lymph Node:** Right side, tender to the touch.\n*   **Migraine:** Severe, 8/10 pain, returning after a period of remission.\n*   **Neck Pain:** Right side, limiting head movement.\n*   **Shoulder Pain:** Right side, related to lifting boxes, possibly aggravated.\n*   **Cystic Acne:** Right cheek.\n*   **Lethargy:** Feeling drained.\n*   **No Fever:**\n\n**Possible Considerations:**\n\n*   **Lymph Node Swelling:** The swollen and painful occipital lymph node is the most concerning symptom right now.\n    *   **Infection:** Lymph nodes often swell in response to a local infection. The acne on your right cheek could be a contributing factor, even without a fever. It is possible to have an infection with no fever\n    *   **Muscle Tension:** Lymph nodes can become inflamed due to the surrounding muscle tension in your neck.\n    *   **Medication Reaction:** Although less likely, lymph node swelling *can* be a rare side effect of some medications. It's less likely since you've been on your current regimen for a while, but Aptiom is relatively new.\n\n*   **Migraine:** The return of your migraine is significant, especially given you were doing well on Aimovig.\n    *   **Trigger:** Packing and lifting boxes could be a trigger due to the physical exertion and stress.\n    *   **Related to Lymph Node:** While less common, inflammation or irritation in the neck area can sometimes trigger or worsen headaches.\n\n*   **Muscle Pain:** The shoulder and neck pain could be related to muscle strain from packing. Muscle tension in the neck can definitely worsen headaches and contribute to overall discomfort.\n\n**Why You Should Be Concerned:**\n\nThe combination of the swollen lymph node, significant pain, headache, and the fact that this is affecting your ability to function warrants medical evaluation. While it could be something relatively benign, it's important to rule out more serious possibilities.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Doctor (Today!):**  Do not delay. Because you are on multiple medications and have underlying conditions (epilepsy, endometriosis, migraines), it's crucial to get professional medical advice. Explain your symptoms, especially the rapid onset of the lymph node swelling and pain. Mention the acne.\n2.  **Be Prepared to Answer Questions:** Your doctor will likely ask about:\n    *   The exact location of the pain and swelling.\n    *   When the symptoms started.\n    *   Any other symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, rash).\n    *   Any recent illnesses or exposures.\n    *   Your full medication list and any recent changes.\n\n**Possible Steps Your Doctor Might Take:**\n\n*   **Physical Exam:** To assess the lymph node, neck, and other relevant areas.\n*   **Blood Tests:** To look for signs of infection or inflammation.\n*   **Imaging (Possibly):** Depending on the exam and blood work, your doctor might consider imaging (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan) of the neck to evaluate the lymph node further.\n*   **Medication Review:** To assess if any of your medications could be contributing.\n*   **Pain Management:** To help manage your pain and headache.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Self-Treatment:**\n\n*   **Avoid Self-Diagnosis:** It's tempting to Google and try to self-diagnose, but it's best to leave that to a medical professional.\n*   **Don't Ignore Symptoms:**  Significant pain and swelling are signs that something is going on.\n*   **Don't Over-Palpate:** You mentioned palpating the lymph node a lot yesterday. Try to avoid touching it excessively, as this can further irritate it.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nIt is important to seek medical advice, preferably today or as soon as possible, given the pain and new symptoms. Early evaluation can lead to a more accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Let your doctor know about your current medications and medical history. Be clear and concise when describing your symptoms.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is definitely a complex and concerning situation, and I understand why you and your family are worried. Here's a breakdown of potential explanations, keeping in mind I'm not a doctor and this is not a diagnosis. It's crucial to rely on the neurologist's evaluation.\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n*   **Complicated Partial Seizures/Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus:**\n    *   This is a strong possibility given the history of epilepsy. Some types of seizures, especially complex partial seizures, can cause a wide range of symptoms including altered behavior, speech difficulties, emotional changes, and automatisms (repetitive, purposeless movements).\n    *   *Status epilepticus* is a prolonged seizure (usually defined as lasting 5 minutes or more, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness in between). *Non-convulsive status epilepticus* is when there's continuous seizure activity in the brain without the typical physical convulsions. This can manifest as confusion, altered mental status, and behavioral changes. The behavior you describe could be a manifestation of continuous seizure activity. The fact that she had multiple seizures close together, and continued altered behavior in between, makes this more likely.\n    *   The 3rd person speech, personality changes, child-like behavior, and incoherent writing could all be seizure-related manifestations.\n\n*   **Post-Ictal State:**\n    *   The *post-ictal state* is the period after a seizure. This can last from minutes to hours, even days. It's common to experience confusion, disorientation, memory loss, and fatigue. In rare cases, complex behaviors and even psychosis can occur in the post-ictal period. However, the duration and complexity of the symptoms might be more suggestive of the other possibilities.\n\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**\n    *   PNES are seizures that look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are a manifestation of psychological distress.\n    *   The history of depression, suspected eating disorder, and potential stressors in her life make this a possibility. PNES can present with bizarre behaviors and dramatic symptoms, including changes in speech and personality. *However, it is important to have a neurologist rule out other causes before considering PNES.*\n    *   The fact that she had actual epileptic seizures makes PNES less likely but not impossible, as people can have both.\n\n*   **Interaction of Medications:**\n    *   The combination of depression medication, sleeping tablets, and now anti-epileptic drugs (if she's started them) could be contributing to the altered mental state. Drug interactions can be complex and unpredictable.\n\n*   **Underlying Medical Conditions:**\n    *   While less likely given the recent epilepsy diagnosis, it's important to rule out other medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms, such as:\n        *   Brain tumor or lesion\n        *   Infection (encephalitis, meningitis)\n        *   Metabolic disturbances (electrolyte imbalances, liver or kidney problems)\n        *   Autoimmune disorders\n\n*   **Dissociative Disorder:**\n    *   While less likely in this acute presentation, a dissociative disorder could be considered, particularly if the symptoms persist and there is a history of trauma or significant psychological stress. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is a complex condition with distinct personality states. However, the recent onset and temporal relationship to seizures make this less likely as a primary diagnosis.\n\n**Why drug use is less likely (but not impossible):**\n\n*   The parents' observation of her being at home is a strong point against drug use. However, it's important to consider that some substances can have long-lasting effects or be ingested/administered in ways that are difficult to detect.\n*   If drug use is suspected, it's important for the hospital to perform a toxicology screen.\n\n**What the Hospital is Likely Doing:**\n\n*   **CT Scan:** To rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain (tumor, stroke, etc.).\n*   **Blood Tests:** To check for infection, metabolic problems, and drug levels.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This is the most important test to look for seizure activity in the brain. They ideally would perform one while she is exhibiting these symptoms.\n*   **Neurological Exam:** The neurologist will assess her mental status, reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n*   **Possibly an MRI:** If the CT scan is normal, an MRI might be needed to get a more detailed image of the brain.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n*   **Provide a Detailed History:** Give the neurologist as much information as possible about her symptoms, timeline, medications, past medical history, and any potential stressors in her life.\n*   **Be Honest:** If there's any possibility of drug use, it's important to be honest with the medical team.\n*   **Advocate for Her:** Make sure she is getting the necessary tests and evaluations.\n*   **Support the Family:** This is a stressful time for everyone. Offer emotional support to your sister-in-law and her parents.\n*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask the medical team questions about her diagnosis and treatment plan.\n*   **Follow Up:** Make sure she has appropriate follow-up care with a neurologist and possibly a psychiatrist.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Eating Disorder:** Her eating disorder may be impacting her overall health and potentially contributing to electrolyte imbalances, which can increase the risk of seizures. It's important to address this as part of her overall care.\n*   **Mental Health:** Her mental health is clearly a significant factor. Addressing her depression and any underlying psychological issues is crucial.\n\n**In conclusion, the first priority is to rule out or confirm ongoing seizure activity. The neurologist will likely focus on the possibility of complicated partial seizures, non-convulsive status epilepticus, or a combination of factors. However, other possibilities need to be considered. It's important to work closely with the medical team to get an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.**\n"

He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",

    "answer": "This is a truly complex and concerning situation. The constellation of symptoms you describe, especially the intolerance to stimuli exacerbated by standing, the intense headaches, nausea/vomiting, balance issues, confusion, and transient anisocoria, points to a few potential, overlapping categories of problems, and the lack of a definitive diagnosis after multiple specialists is frustrating and worrisome.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my thoughts, potential avenues to explore, and why certain tests might be more important than others, given the information you've provided:\n\n**Key Symptoms and Possible Interpretations:**\n\n*   **Intolerance to Stimuli (Light, Activity, Eating):**  This points strongly towards **central sensitization** or **neurological dysfunction/inflammation.**  Central sensitization is where the nervous system becomes hypersensitive, amplifying pain and other sensory input.\n*   **Orthostatic Exacerbation:**  Symptoms dramatically worsening upon standing suggests issues with:\n    *   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Leak:**  A CSF leak can cause orthostatic headaches, nausea, vomiting, and brain sag, leading to various neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** While POTS doesn't typically cause the specific headache described, it can contribute to nausea, lightheadedness, and fatigue, which can worsen overall tolerance.\n    *   **Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** While the MRI was normal, IIH can sometimes be missed early on. IIH can cause orthostatic issues due to its impact on cerebral blood flow regulation.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:** While he's stopped most medications, the nitroglycerin patches could be contributing to the orthostatic issues.\n*   **Stabbing Headache (Back of Head):**  This raises concern for:\n    *   **Occipital Neuralgia:** But wouldn't explain other symptoms.\n    *   **Cervicogenic Headache:** Related to neck issues, but less likely to cause all the described symptoms.\n    *   **CSF Leak** (mentioned above): The type of headache you described is more common in CSF leaks.\n*   **Nausea/Vomiting, Balance Issues, Confusion:** These indicate a problem affecting the brainstem or cerebellum, either directly or indirectly. This could be from:\n    *   **Increased Intracranial Pressure:** From any cause (including tumors, though the MRI was negative).\n    *   **Brainstem Dysfunction:**  Potentially inflammatory or metabolic.\n    *   **Drug Toxicity or Withdrawal:** Although he is off most meds, it needs consideration.\n    *   **Dehydration:** Can worsen all of the symptoms.\n*   **Anisocoria:**  This is a critical finding! Unequal pupil sizes can indicate:\n    *   **Neurological Issue:** Affecting the nerves that control pupil size (e.g., Horner's syndrome, compression of the oculomotor nerve).\n    *   **Brainstem Involvement:** In severe cases.\n    *   **Drug Effect:**  Less likely given that it is only occurring occasionally.\n*   **Liver Function Abnormalities (Elevated ALT/AST, Low Ceruloplasmin, Low Carnitine):**  These are important clues and suggest:\n    *   **Wilson's Disease:**  Testing for this is critical.\n    *   **Metabolic Disorder:**  The low carnitine needs further investigation.\n    *   **Drug-Induced Liver Injury:** This is always a possibility, even with medications that were stopped.\n    *   **Porphyria:** Also being investigated.\n*   **Narrow Bile Ducts:**  This finding on the CT scan, coupled with liver enzyme abnormalities, needs to be thoroughly evaluated with the MRCP results.\n\n**Urgent Actions and Further Investigations:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Wilson's Disease and Porphyria Testing:**  Get these blood and urine tests done as soon as physically possible.  These are potentially treatable conditions that can cause severe neurological and systemic symptoms. The sooner they're ruled out (or diagnosed), the better.\n2.  **CSF Leak Evaluation:** This is a HUGE consideration given the orthostatic headaches and other symptoms.\n    *   **Referral to a Neurologist specializing in CSF leaks:**  Not all neurologists have expertise in this area.  Look for someone familiar with diagnosing and treating CSF leaks (e.g., at a major academic medical center).\n    *   **Brain MRI with and without Gadolinium:**  Sometimes subtle findings can be missed on the initial MRI. Look for signs of brain sag, dural enhancement, or pituitary abnormalities.\n    *   **Spinal MRI with and without Gadolinium:** Look for signs of CSF leaks.\n    *   **CSF Pressure Measurement (Lumbar Puncture):**  Considered in some cases, but can be risky if there's a concern for IIH.\n    *   **CT Myelogram:**  This is the gold standard for identifying the location of a CSF leak, but it's invasive.\n3.  **Repeat Liver Function Tests and Ceruloplasmin/Carnitine Levels:**  Monitor these closely. Persistently abnormal liver function needs a cause identified.\n4.  **Complete Medication Review:** Although he stopped most medications, have a detailed discussion with a pharmacist or physician about potential withdrawal symptoms, delayed side effects, or drug interactions.\n5.  **Rule Out Infection:** Even though meningitis is less likely, consider other less common infections (e.g., Lyme disease, other tick-borne illnesses, atypical infections).\n6.  **Consider Autoimmune/Inflammatory Workup:** Sometimes, autoimmune conditions can present with neurological symptoms. Testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and other autoimmune markers may be helpful.\n7.  **Assess for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):** Given the diverse and fluctuating symptoms, MCAS could be considered. Discuss with his doctor whether testing for mast cell mediators (e.g., histamine, tryptase) would be appropriate.\n8.  **Address Dehydration:** Given that vomiting is a prominent symptom, it's important to hydrate the patient. If he cannot tolerate oral fluids, IV fluids may be necessary.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate for Your Partner:**  You are his voice, and your detailed observations are invaluable.  Be assertive with the doctors, emphasizing the severity of his symptoms and the impact on his life.\n*   **Second Opinions:** Don't hesitate to seek second (or even third) opinions from specialists at different medical centers.\n*   **Keep Detailed Records:**  Maintain a log of his symptoms, triggers, medications (past and present), test results, and doctor visits. This information can be extremely helpful in piecing together the puzzle.\n*   **Mental Health Support:**  This is an incredibly stressful situation for both of you.  Seek counseling or support groups to cope with the emotional challenges.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It is essential to consult with qualified healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment.

    "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

    "answer": "I am so incredibly sorry to hear what you're going through. Witnessing a loved one experience SRSE is a terrifying and heartbreaking ordeal. You're doing everything you can by seeking information and exploring all possibilities. I am an AI and cannot give medical advice, but I can offer some information and potential avenues to explore.\n\n**Understanding SRSE and Prognosis:**\n\n*   **SRSE (Super-Refractory Status Epilepticus):** This is a particularly challenging form of status epilepticus that continues despite multiple lines of treatment, including anesthetics. The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of brain damage and other complications.\n*   **Prognosis:** The prognosis for SRSE is complex and depends on many factors, including the underlying cause, the duration of seizures, the patient's age and overall health, and the response to treatment. Unfortunately, prolonged SRSE can lead to cognitive impairment, motor deficits, and even death. However, recovery is possible, and some patients regain significant function.\n*   **Brain Damage:** The extent of potential brain damage is a major concern with prolonged SRSE. Seizures can cause excitotoxicity (overstimulation of neurons), leading to cell death. The longer the seizures continue, the greater the risk of irreversible damage.\n\n**Possible Causes and Diagnostic Considerations:**\n\nGiven the negative lumbar punctures for common infectious causes, it's crucial to aggressively pursue other potential etiologies. Here are some things you should ask the doctors about:\n\n*   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** You mentioned autoimmune disorder labs are pending. This is critical. Autoimmune encephalitis occurs when the immune system attacks the brain, causing inflammation and seizures. There are many types of autoimmune encephalitis, and some can be difficult to diagnose.\n    *   **Antibody Testing:** Make sure they are testing for a *broad* panel of neuronal antibodies, including antibodies against NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, GABA-B receptors, LGI1, CASPR2, and others. Some antibodies are more common than others, but it's important to rule out as many as possible. Sometimes these tests can take a while.\n    *   **Repeat Lumbar Puncture with Specific Autoimmune Panel:** The first lumbar punctures may not have been focused on autoimmune causes. A repeat LP with a specific autoimmune encephalitis panel is warranted.\n    *   **Consider IVIG or Plasmapheresis:** If autoimmune encephalitis is suspected, even before definitive antibody results are available, consider asking about starting IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) or plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). These treatments can help remove harmful antibodies from the blood.\n*   **Toxic/Metabolic Causes:**\n    *   **Withdrawal:** Given the history of alcohol and marijuana use, withdrawal should be considered, although the timeframe may make it less likely. The switch from Buspirone to Prozac is a possible cause and should be investigated.\n    *   **Heavy Metal Toxicity:** While less common, consider heavy metal toxicity, especially if there was any potential exposure.\n*   **Genetic Causes:**\n    *   **Genetic Testing:** In some cases, SRSE can be caused by genetic mutations affecting ion channels or other brain functions. Genetic testing may be considered, although results can take time.\n*   **Rare Infections:**\n    *   **Consider less common viral or fungal infections:** While initial lumbar punctures were negative, it's important to consider the possibility of less common infections that may not be readily detected.\n*   **NCSE (Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus):** Even if the convulsive seizures are somewhat controlled, she may still be experiencing non-convulsive seizure activity detectable only on EEG. This can contribute to ongoing brain damage and needs to be addressed.\n*   **MRI:** You mentioned that the doctor said an MRI was unimportant until the seizures stop. While it's true that an MRI can be difficult to perform on an unstable patient, it can provide valuable information about the underlying cause of the SRSE (e.g., structural abnormalities, inflammation). If her condition stabilizes even briefly, push for an MRI.\n\n**Potential Treatment Strategies (Discuss with Doctors):**\n\n*   **Ketogenic Diet:** Some studies suggest that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet) can be helpful in treating refractory seizures. This is a metabolic therapy that can alter brain energy metabolism and potentially reduce seizure activity. It requires careful monitoring and management.\n*   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** VNS involves implanting a device that stimulates the vagus nerve. It has been used to treat epilepsy and may be helpful in some cases of SRSE.\n*   **Allopregnanolone:** You mentioned the study with allopregnanolone. While the evidence is limited, it is an option you could discuss with her doctors.\n*   **Hypothermia:** In some cases, induced hypothermia (cooling the body temperature) has been used to reduce brain metabolism and potentially protect against seizure-related damage.\n*   **Immunomodulatory Therapies:** If autoimmune encephalitis is suspected, in addition to IVIG and plasmapheresis, other immunomodulatory therapies like rituximab or cyclophosphamide may be considered.\n* **Clinical Trials:** Search for clinical trials regarding SRSE and see if she may qualify.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate for Aggressive Investigation:** Be a strong advocate for your fiance. Ask questions, push for further testing, and don't be afraid to get a second opinion from another neurologist or epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy).\n*   **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of all treatments, medications, and any changes in her condition. This can be helpful for the medical team.\n*   **Communicate with the Medical Team:** Maintain open and frequent communication with the doctors and nurses. Ask them to explain everything clearly and answer your questions.\n*   **Self-Care:** Remember to take care of yourself during this difficult time. Seek support from family, friends, or a therapist. You can't effectively advocate for your fiance if you're not taking care of your own well-being.\n\n**Regarding Recovery:**\n\n*   **Potential for Recovery:** It is impossible to predict the extent of recovery at this point. However, the brain has a remarkable capacity for healing and plasticity. Even with significant brain damage, some patients can regain function through rehabilitation and therapy.\n*   **Rehabilitation:** If she survives the SRSE, she will likely need extensive rehabilitation, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.\n*   **Cognitive Recovery:** Cognitive recovery can be a long and challenging process. She may experience difficulties with memory, attention, and executive function. However, with intensive rehabilitation and support, she may be able to improve her cognitive abilities.\n\n**The Hard Truth:**\n\nIt's important to be realistic about the potential outcomes of SRSE. The longer the seizures continue, the greater the risk of permanent brain damage and other complications. However, it's also important to remain hopeful and focus on doing everything possible to support your fiance.\n\n**Connecting with Others:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** The Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) is a valuable resource for information and support. They also have online forums where you can connect with other people who have experienced SRSE.\n*   **Support Groups:** Consider joining a support group for families of people with epilepsy or brain injuries. Sharing your experiences with others can be helpful and empowering.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou are facing an incredibly difficult situation, and I want to commend you for your strength and dedication to your fiance. Please remember that you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you. Keep advocating for her, stay informed, and never give up hope.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down those terms from your diagnosis and discuss their potential implications in the context of your temporal lobe epilepsy and right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis.\n\n**Understanding the Terms:**\n\n*   **Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone:**\n    *   \"Dilatation\" means widening or enlargement.\n    *   \"Ventricular trigone\" is a specific region of the brain's ventricles (fluid-filled spaces). It's where the occipital, temporal, and posterior horns of the lateral ventricle meet.\n    *   \"Ex-vacuo\" means \"from a vacuum\" or \"secondary to loss of surrounding tissue.\"  In this context, it means the widening of the ventricular trigone is likely due to a *loss of brain tissue* (atrophy) in the surrounding area.  The ventricles expand to fill the space left by the shrinking tissue. So, the expansion is a result of something else (the atrophy) rather than the cause of a problem itself.\n\n*   **T-weighted high-signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe:**\n    *   \"Gliosis\" is the formation of glial scar tissue in the brain. Glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia) are support cells in the brain. When brain tissue is damaged (e.g., by injury, inflammation, or long-term seizure activity), these glial cells proliferate and create a \"scar\" of sorts.\n    *   \"T-weighted\" refers to the type of MRI sequence used.  T2-weighted images are good at detecting areas of increased water content, which is often seen in gliosis.  The \"high signal\" indicates that the area is brighter than normal on the T2-weighted MRI, suggesting increased water content and thus, gliosis.\n    *   \"Periventricular white matter\" is the white matter *surrounding* the ventricles (those fluid-filled spaces).  White matter contains myelinated nerve fibers (axons) that connect different areas of the brain.\n    *   \"Parietal lobe\" is one of the four major lobes of the brain, located behind the frontal lobe and above the occipital lobe. It's involved in sensory processing (touch, temperature, pain, spatial awareness), and some language and cognitive functions.\n\n    *In summary, this means there's evidence of scar tissue formation (gliosis) in the white matter surrounding the ventricles in the right parietal lobe. This suggests some prior injury or inflammation in that area.*\n\n*   **Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus:**\n\n    *   This is a general term, but the context (your diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy and MTS) makes it much more specific.  The abnormalities are likely referring to the *structural* changes and functional impairments associated with MTS.\n    *   In MTS, the hippocampus shrinks (atrophies), becomes scarred, and its internal structure is disrupted. This disruption of the hippocampus's normal circuitry is a key factor in the development and propagation of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. This abnormal activity can spread out from the hippocampus and trigger seizures that affect your consciousness and/or trigger tonic-clonic seizures.\n\n*   **Associated regional atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus:**\n\n    *   \"Atrophy\" means shrinkage or wasting away of tissue.\n    *   \"Regional\" means it's localized to a specific area.\n    *   \"Thalamus\" is a key relay station in the brain. It receives sensory information and relays it to the cerebral cortex.  It also plays a role in motor control, sleep, and alertness.\n    *   \"Dorsal thalamus\" refers to the upper (dorsal) portion of the thalamus.\n\n    *In summary, this means that a portion of your thalamus on the right side has shrunk.  This is likely related to the hippocampal damage, as these structures are interconnected. Long-term seizure activity can lead to damage in connected regions.*\n\n*   **Periventricular white matter (general explanation):**\n    *   As mentioned above, the periventricular white matter is the white matter that surrounds the ventricles in the brain. It contains the nerve fibers (axons) that connect different brain regions. It's a normal part of the brain, but the presence of gliosis *within* it suggests damage or inflammation in that specific location.\n\n**Connecting the Dots and Potential Implications:**\n\nHere's how these findings might relate to each other and your epilepsy:\n\n*   **Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS) as the Primary Issue:** The MTS in the right hippocampus is the most likely driver of your seizures. The abnormal electrical activity originating in the hippocampus can spread to other brain regions.\n\n*   **Thalamic Atrophy:** The atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus is probably *secondary* to the hippocampal damage and/or long-term seizure activity. The hippocampus and thalamus are connected, and chronic seizure activity can disrupt these connections and lead to atrophy in the thalamus.\n\n*   **Gliosis in the Parietal Lobe:** The gliosis in the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe is the trickiest to interpret without more information. Potential explanations include:\n    *   **Seizure spread:** Seizures originating in the temporal lobe can spread to the parietal lobe, causing damage over time.\n    *   **Remote effects of hippocampal damage:** The hippocampus and parietal lobe are indirectly connected. Damage to the hippocampus might have led to changes in the parietal lobe.\n    *   **Previous ischemic or inflammatory event:** As your neurologist suggested, a past stroke (ischemic event) or inflammatory process could have damaged that area. This may have happened before your seizures began.\n\n*   **Ex-vacuo Dilatation:** It's very important to understand that the dilatation of the ventricular trigone is because of the loss of surrounding brain tissue in the hippocampus and is a secondary effect.\n\n**What does this mean for you?**\n\n*   **Seizure Control:** The findings help explain why your seizures might be difficult to control with medication. MTS often makes epilepsy more resistant to medication.\n*   **Cognitive Function:** The damage to the hippocampus and potentially the parietal lobe could contribute to cognitive difficulties, such as memory problems, spatial disorientation, or language issues. The specific symptoms depend on the extent and location of the damage.\n*   **Treatment Options:** Knowing the specific location and nature of the brain abnormalities is crucial for considering other treatment options like surgery (resection of the hippocampus) or responsive neurostimulation (RNS) if medication isn't fully effective.\n\n**What to discuss with your neurologist:**\n\n*   **Specifics of the gliosis:** Ask for more details about the gliosis in the parietal lobe.  Is there any way to determine when it occurred or what the cause might have been?\n*   **Impact on cognitive function:** Discuss your specific cognitive concerns and ask if the MRI findings correlate with those concerns. Neuropsychological testing might be helpful.\n*   **Further evaluation:** Are there other tests that might be useful, such as EEG monitoring or functional MRI (fMRI) to better understand how the brain is functioning?\n*   **Treatment options:** If your seizures are poorly controlled, discuss the possibility of surgical evaluation or other advanced therapies.\n\nIn summary, your MRI results paint a picture of temporal lobe epilepsy that is probably caused by abnormalities in the hippocampus. The other findings (thalamic atrophy and parietal lobe gliosis) might be secondary effects of the epilepsy or could represent other past events.\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes.

    "answer": "This is a complex and concerning situation. You're experiencing a constellation of symptoms that are significantly impacting your life, and it's understandable that you're seeking answers. It sounds like you're advocating for yourself, and it's important to continue doing so.\n\nLet's break down the key issues and potential next steps:\n\n**1. Lazy Eye (Strabismus/Diplopia) and Eye Muscle Weakness:**\n\n*   **Sudden Onset and Variability:** The rapid onset and fluctuating nature of your lazy eye (strabismus) is a crucial detail. The fact that your glasses correct it and that you can switch eye dominance is significant. The random eye closure episodes add to the complexity.\n*   **Myasthenia Gravis Workup:** Even with negative antibodies, Myasthenia Gravis (MG) cannot be completely ruled out. \"Seronegative MG\" exists. The rapid response and then withdrawal from Mestinon can complicate matters.\n*   **Neuro-Ophthalmology Consultation:** This is the *absolutely* correct next step. A neuro-ophthalmologist specializes in visual problems related to the nervous system. They can evaluate your eye movements, pupils, and visual fields in detail, and look for subtle signs that a general neurologist might miss.\n*   **Consider alternative diagnoses:** It would be pertinent to ask your neuro-opthalmologist about other possible causes of your symptoms, such as Miller-Fisher syndrome or a cranial nerve palsy.\n\n**2. Vertigo, Nystagmus, and Oscillopsia:**\n\n*   **Differentiation:** Vertigo, nystagmus, and oscillopsia are related but distinct. Vertigo is the sensation of spinning. Nystagmus is involuntary eye movements. Oscillopsia is the subjective experience of the world visually \"bouncing\" or oscillating.\n*   **PT's Oscillopsia Suggestion:** If your physical therapist suspects oscillopsia, this is important. It suggests a problem with gaze stabilization, likely originating in the brainstem or cerebellum.\n*   **MRI Normal:** A \"normal\" MRI doesn't always mean there's nothing wrong. Subtle lesions, inflammation, or microscopic changes might be missed. A *contrast-enhanced* MRI of the brainstem and cerebellum could be considered, if one hasn't been done.\n*   **Central vs. Peripheral:** Vestibular disorders can be peripheral (inner ear) or central (brain). Central causes are more concerning and often present with other neurological symptoms.\n*   **Migraine-Associated Vertigo (Vestibular Migraine):** Given your history of complex migraines, vestibular migraine is a possibility. However, the severity and associated symptoms like vomiting and oscillopsia warrant a thorough investigation beyond just migraine treatment.\n\n**3. Seizures and Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Seizure Type:** Clarify the type of seizures you are experiencing. Generalized, focal aware, focal impaired awareness? This information helps guide investigation.\n*   **Medication Levels:** Ensure your Trileptal and Lamictal levels are therapeutic.\n*   **EEG:** Repeat EEG to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus.\n\n**4. Tremor and Flushing:**\n\n*   **Tremor Type:** Is it a resting tremor, intention tremor, or postural tremor? This helps narrow down the possible causes.\n*   **Flushing:** Red palms and body flushing suggest possible causes such as histamine excess or even carcinoid syndrome.\n*   **Grayish-Purple Foot:** This points to a vascular issue in your foot (poor circulation, vasospasm). It needs to be evaluated to rule out arterial or venous problems.\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Taken together (flushing, breathing issues, potential vascular issues), these symptoms suggest possible autonomic dysfunction.\n\n**5. Other Neurological Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Muscle weakness:** The eye closure episodes could be indicative of more widespread muscle weakness.\n*   **Breathing Problems:** The shallow breathing episodes are concerning and need to be thoroughly investigated. Sleep apnea or neuromuscular respiratory weakness should be considered.\n\n**6. Hashimoto's/Hypothyroidism:**\n\n*   **TSH and Free T4:** Make sure your thyroid hormone levels are optimally managed. Even slight variations can affect neurological function.\n\n**Recommendations & Questions to Ask Your Doctors:**\n\n1.  **Neuro-Ophthalmology:**\n    *   \"What are the possible causes of my fluctuating strabismus, diplopia, and eye muscle weakness, especially considering the sudden onset and the fact that Mestinon seemed to help?\"\n    *   \"Could this be a form of seronegative Myasthenia Gravis or another neuromuscular disorder?\"\n    *   \"What specific eye movement tests will you perform to evaluate my vestibular system and eye muscle function?\"\n2.  **Neurologist:**\n    *   \"Given the new symptoms (tremor, flushing, foot discoloration, breathing problems), are you considering other diagnoses besides epilepsy and migraine? What other tests can be done?\"\n    *   \"Could this be related to autonomic dysfunction? If so, what testing is warranted?\"\n    *   \"Could this be a brainstem lesion or another cause of central vestibular dysfunction that was missed on the initial MRI? Should we repeat the MRI with contrast, focusing on the brainstem and cerebellum?\"\n    *   \"What other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions should be considered?\"\n    *   \"Is it possible that the seizures are somehow related to the other symptoms, even if the initial workup was negative?\"\n3.  **Consider Additional Consultations:**\n    *   **ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist):** To rule out any remaining peripheral vestibular issues, especially if the neuro-ophthalmologist isn't finding a clear cause.\n    *   **Rheumatologist:** To evaluate for autoimmune conditions that can affect the nervous system.\n    *   **Cardiologist:** To assess for potential heart conditions that could cause fainting or other symptoms.\n    *   **Sleep Specialist:** To evaluate the nocturnal breathing issues and rule out sleep apnea or other sleep disorders.\n    *   **Endocrinologist:** Given that you have Hashimoto's and you are having other issues that could be related to endocrine dysfunction (flushing).\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:** Record the timing, triggers, severity, and duration of all your symptoms. This will be invaluable to your doctors.\n*   **Bring a List of All Medications and Supplements:** Including dosages and frequency.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Seek a Second Opinion:** If you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed, seek another opinion from a neurologist with expertise in complex neurological disorders.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** You know your body best. Don't hesitate to ask questions, express concerns, and push for further investigation.\n\nThis is a complex diagnostic puzzle. Finding the answer may take time, persistence, and a collaborative effort between multiple specialists. Don't give up advocating for yourself. I hope you get answers and effective treatment soon.\n"

    "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, that's a complex situation, and your concerns are valid. It's understandable that you're seeking clarity and guidance. Let's break down the scenario and address your questions.\n\n**Does my theory make sense? Is it likely?**\n\nYes, your theory is plausible and aligns with what is understood about PNES and epilepsy. Here's why:\n\n*   **Co-occurrence:** The 10-25% statistic of PNES patients also having epilepsy is a significant detail. It suggests that in some individuals, both conditions can exist independently.\n\n*   **Masking/Unmasking:** The Keppra could have been suppressing underlying epileptic activity, which was causing the hallucinations. By controlling the epileptic component, it allowed the PNES to become more prominent and clearly diagnosed. However, now that the Keppra is gone, the epileptic component is no longer being controlled, causing the hallucinations to return.\n\n*   **PNES Complexity:** PNES can be influenced by stress, psychological factors, and even underlying neurological conditions. The initial psychiatric issues could be a predisposing factor, and the Keppra's impact on the neurological aspects might have been influencing the expression of the PNES symptoms.\n\n*   **Diagnostic Challenges:** It can be difficult to tease apart epileptic seizures and PNES, especially when they present with overlapping symptoms like altered awareness and behavioral changes. The fact that the initial EEG was cut short could also have impacted the findings. A longer EEG and closer monitoring may have been beneficial.\n\n**Why would the hallucinations come back only after stopping Keppra?**\n\nThis is the crucial question. If the Keppra was controlling underlying epileptic activity, then stopping it would logically lead to the return of the epileptic symptoms, in this case, the hallucinations. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n*   **Direct Antiepileptic Effect:** Keppra is an antiepileptic drug. If there was underlying epileptic activity contributing to the hallucinations (even if not causing the PNES), Keppra would suppress that activity. The hallucinations would subside because their neurological basis was being treated.\n\n*   **No Other Changes:** You clearly stated no other medications were added or removed. If it wasn't a change in medication or dosage of other medications, it strongly implies the Keppra withdrawal is the reason for the return of the hallucinations.\n\n**Next Steps and Recommendations:**\n\nGiven your situation, here's what I recommend doing:\n\n1.  **Urgent Contact with Neurologist:** Don't wait for a standard appointment. Contact the neurologist's office and explain the return of hallucinations since stopping Keppra. Emphasize that this is causing distress and disruption. They may be able to expedite an appointment or offer interim advice. It is very important to talk to your neurologist immediately to rule out seizures and/or epilepsy.\n2.  **Reconsider EEG:** Discuss with the neurologist the possibility of a longer, more comprehensive EEG. The previous one was cut short, which may have led to inaccurate findings.\n3.  **Psychiatrist Communication:** Keep the psychiatrist informed about the return of hallucinations and your concerns about underlying epilepsy. It will be important that both clinicians communicate with each other to ensure that a proper treatment plan is in place to address all of the symptoms your wife is experiencing.\n4.  **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizure (PNES) Treatment:** Start receiving treatment for the PNES. The gold standard for treating PNES is cognitive behavioral therapy or other forms of psychotherapy. Treatment can also consist of stress reduction techniques, mindfulness, and other alternative therapies.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** It's essential to consider the possibility of a misdiagnosis or the coexistence of both epilepsy and PNES. The symptoms are so similar that it can be difficult to distinguish the two. It is always best to err on the side of caution.\n*   **Medication Management:** Work closely with the healthcare providers to find a medication regimen that effectively addresses both the psychiatric symptoms and any potential epileptic components.\n*   **Support System:** Continue providing your wife with a supportive and understanding environment. PNES and epilepsy can be challenging to live with, and emotional support is crucial.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional.

    "question": " Hi, I bit of back story here I've been diagnostic with NF1 when I was 5 ever since I had to do 2 MRI every year. every time they put a needle in my arm I would faint.So today I just got my blood draw for a schedule MRI in 3 weeks. And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a stressful experience, and it's understandable that you're looking for information. What you're describing is likely a **vasovagal syncope** with some additional motor activity, which can sometimes be mistaken for a seizure but is usually not. Let's break down the components:\n\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope (Fainting):** This is the most likely underlying cause. It's a common reaction to triggers like blood draws, pain, or emotional distress. The vagus nerve is overstimulated, leading to a drop in heart rate and blood pressure. This reduces blood flow to the brain, causing you to faint. The history of fainting during blood draws strongly supports this.\n*   **Motor Activity (Uncontrollable Arm and Leg Movements):** This is where it gets a little more nuanced. When the brain is deprived of oxygen during syncope, it can sometimes cause brief, involuntary muscle movements. This is called **convulsive syncope** or **syncope with myoclonic jerks**. The \"myoclonic jerks\" are the brief, shock-like muscle contractions. This does *not* necessarily mean you had a seizure. It simply means your brain was reacting to the temporary lack of blood flow.\n\n**Why does this happen in Vasovagal Syncope?**\n\nWhen blood flow to the brain is severely reduced, the brain cells become hyper-excitable. This can lead to:\n\n*   **Myoclonic Jerks:** These are brief, involuntary muscle twitches or jerks.\n*   **Rigidity:** Sometimes, the body can become stiff or rigid.\n*   **Opisthotonos:** In rare and severe cases, the body can arch backward.\n\n**Important Considerations Given Your NF1 Diagnosis**\n\n*   **NF1 and Vasovagal Syncope:** Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) itself is not directly known to increase the risk of vasovagal syncope. The link is more likely through increased anxiety and stress related to medical procedures.\n*   **MRI and Anxiety:** Given that you have regular MRIs due to your NF1, the anxiety associated with these scans and blood draws can trigger vasovagal syncope.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Doctor:** It's **crucial** to discuss this episode with your doctor. They will want to rule out any other potential causes and make sure you're receiving the best care. Explain in detail exactly what happened to you, including:\n    *   What you felt before fainting (dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, visual changes)\n    *   The type of movements you experienced\n    *   How long the movements lasted\n    *   How you felt after regaining consciousness (confusion, headache, muscle soreness)\n2.  **Strategies for Managing Vasovagal Syncope:**\n    *   **Applied Tension:** Learn techniques where you tense your muscles when you feel the prodromal symptoms of fainting. This can help increase blood pressure.\n    *   **Hydration and Salt:** Ensure you are well-hydrated and have adequate salt intake (unless you have a medical condition that restricts this).\n    *   **Avoid Triggers:** Be aware of your triggers (e.g., seeing the needle).\n    *   **Communicate:** Tell the phlebotomist *before* the blood draw that you have a history of fainting.\n    *   **Have the Blood Draw Lying Down:** This can prevent the blood pressure drop that leads to fainting.\n3.  **Consider Psychological Support:** If anxiety surrounding the MRI and blood draws is significant, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques can be helpful.\n4.  **Preparation for future MRI** Talk to your doctor about the possibility of using numbing cream on the site before the needle injection. And ask if they can prescribe any medication such as diazepam or lorazepam to ease your stress before the injection.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and discussion only. Always consult with your healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.\n\nI hope this explanation is helpful. Please make sure to discuss this with your doctor for a proper evaluation and management plan.\n"

    "question": "49YO female with IBS like symptoms due to adhesions choking intestines, non-epileptic seizures due to migraines, deaf, in TCHP chemo for breast cancer, BMX August 1, 2018, no node involvement. 5'6, 220lbs. Effexor for seizure prevention. Bupropion for situational depression related to health challenges. I lost my hair to chemo, so for the first time I noticed I have ridges in my scalp. Googling that, only one thing comes up: Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG). My ridges, however, are very mild compared to most images. I can see them in the mirror, but can't find a way to accurately photograph them. They are very much like this in location and \"layout\", but not quite as deep. This is listed as something different though, related to mental retardation (article's words) from birth. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00105-007-1302-4 I do have a couple of the secondary issues listed, namely non-epileptic seizures and deafness. The former is blamed on migraines that left lesions on the brain and the latter is blamed on the seizures. Should I see an endocrinologist, or is this something else?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, given your complex medical history and the potential connection you've found, let's break down what to consider and who to see:\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n*   **Complex Presentation:** You have a constellation of health issues: breast cancer treatment (TCHP chemo, BMX), IBS-like symptoms, non-epileptic seizures, deafness, migraines, and depression. The chemo is current.\n*   **New Symptom (Scalp Ridges):** The scalp ridges are a new observation, likely noticed because of hair loss.\n*   **CVG Concern:** You are concerned about Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG) based on your Google search, but recognize that your ridges are mild.\n*   **Link to Other Conditions:** You've found an article linking CVG-like scalp ridges to intellectual disability, seizures, and deafness. While you don't have intellectual disability, you do have the other two.\n*   **Deafness and Seizures causes** Your seizures were blamed on migraines. Your deafness was blamed on your seizures.\n\n**Is it CVG?**\n\nCVG is a rare condition characterized by folds and ridges on the scalp, resembling the surface of the brain. It's classified into:\n\n*   **Primary Essential CVG:** Occurs without any other associated conditions.\n*   **Primary Non-Essential CVG:** Associated with neurological or psychiatric disorders, but not a specific cause.\n*   **Secondary CVG:** Occurs as a result of another underlying condition like endocrine disorders, inflammatory conditions, tumors, or skin disorders.\n\n**Why You're Right to Investigate**\n\n*   **New Symptom in the Context of Systemic Illness:** Any new symptom arising during or after cancer treatment warrants investigation, even if it seems minor. Chemo can have diverse and sometimes unexpected side effects.\n*   **Potential Connection to Neurological Issues:** Your history of seizures and deafness makes it reasonable to explore potential neurological connections.\n*   **Rule Out Underlying Cause:** It's important to rule out secondary causes of CVG, which can include endocrine problems.\n\n**Possible Explanations and Next Steps**\n\nHere's a breakdown of possible explanations for your scalp ridges and what to do next:\n\n1.  **Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG):** Although your ridges are mild, it's still a possibility. Your history of seizures and deafness raises the possibility of Primary Non-Essential CVG or Secondary CVG.\n\n2.  **Chemotherapy Side Effect:** Chemotherapy can affect skin and hair follicle development. It's possible that the ridges are a result of the chemotherapy affecting the scalp skin or hair follicles that you didn't notice until your hair fell out. These changes might be temporary or may resolve after treatment ends.\n\n3.  **Normal Scalp Anatomy:** Scalp anatomy can vary significantly between individuals. It's possible that the ridges are a normal variation that you only noticed after losing your hair.\n\n4.  **Other Skin Conditions:** Certain skin conditions can cause scalp thickening or ridging.\n\n5.  **Stress/Nutrient Deficiencies:** High stress and/or nutrient deficiencies can cause unexpected changes to your body.\n\n**Who to See and in What Order**\n\nHere's the recommended approach:\n\n1.  **Oncologist:**\n    *   **First and Foremost:** Discuss this with your oncologist *immediately*. Because you are in active treatment, they need to be informed of *any* new symptoms. They know your medical history best and can assess whether this is related to your cancer treatment or something else.\n    *   **Medication Interactions:** Because you are on several medications, they need to be involved in the process of determining who you should see next.\n\n2.  **Dermatologist:**\n    *   **Primary Evaluation:** A dermatologist is the most appropriate specialist to initially examine your scalp. They can perform a visual inspection, palpation, and potentially a skin biopsy if needed.\n    *   **Differential Diagnosis:** The dermatologist can help differentiate between CVG, chemotherapy-related skin changes, normal variations, and other skin conditions.\n\n3.  **Neurologist:**\n    * If the dermatologist suspects CVG or a neurological component, they may refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation.\n    * Given your history of seizures and deafness, a neurologist can assess whether these conditions are related to the scalp changes.\n\n4.  **Endocrinologist:**\n    *   **Based on Dermatologist/Neurologist Findings:** See an endocrinologist **only if** the dermatologist or neurologist suspects an endocrine-related cause. Your oncologist may weigh in here as well. An endocrinologist can evaluate for hormonal imbalances or other endocrine disorders that might be contributing to the scalp changes.\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctors**\n\n*   **Be Thorough:** Explain that you noticed the scalp ridges after hair loss due to chemo.\n*   **Mention the Article:** Share the information you found about the scalp ridges, seizures, and deafness (the SpringerLink article).\n*   **Express Your Concerns:** Explain that you're concerned about the potential link to other neurological issues.\n*   **List All Your Medications:** Provide a complete list of all medications you're currently taking, including Effexor and Bupropion.\n*   **Document Everything:** Keep a record of your symptoms, questions, and any advice you receive from your doctors.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Avoid Self-Diagnosing:** While it's good that you're being proactive and researching your symptoms, avoid self-diagnosing. Rely on your doctors' expertise for an accurate diagnosis.\n*   **Anxiety Management:** It's understandable to be anxious about new health concerns. Talk to your doctor about managing your anxiety.\n*   **Focus on Symptom Relief:** In the meantime, focus on managing your IBS-like symptoms, seizures, and depression as effectively as possible.\n*   **Communicate openly with your medical team** This situation underscores the importance of open communication and collaboration between your various specialists.\n\n**In summary, schedule an appointment with your oncologist and dermatologist and discuss your concerns. They can perform a thorough evaluation and determine the most appropriate course of action. Seeing a neurologist and endocrinologist can be considered after those appointments based on the findings.**\n"

    "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable to be cautious about increasing medication dosages, especially when you're seeing positive results already. You're right to ask questions and understand the rationale behind the neurologist's recommendation. Here's a breakdown of why your neurologist might be suggesting a dosage increase, and points to consider when discussing it further:\n\n**Possible Reasons for Increasing the Dosage Despite Improvement:**\n\n*   **Prophylactic Treatment/Targeting Complete Seizure Control:** While your son has shown improvement, the goal of epilepsy management isn't just to reduce seizures, but ideally to achieve *complete* seizure freedom. Even infrequent seizures can have an impact on development, safety, and overall quality of life. The neurologist might be aiming for a dosage that provides a higher level of seizure control to minimize the risk of future breakthrough seizures.\n*   **\"Therapeutic Range\" and Dosage Titer:** Keppra, like many anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), is often prescribed within a range of dosages. The neurologist may believe that your son isn't yet at a therapeutic level with the 2ml dosage. The initial dosage is often lower to assess tolerance and then increased gradually to find the optimal balance between efficacy and side effects. It is also very common to increase medication dosage according to weight. \n*   **Individual Variability:** People metabolize medications differently. The neurologist may be estimating that your son's body needs a slightly higher dose to maintain a consistent therapeutic level of Keppra in his system throughout the day. They may have taken his weight into consideration when determining this.\n*   **Long-Term Management Strategy:** Sometimes, doctors prefer to establish a solid baseline of seizure control early on, especially in newly diagnosed epilepsy cases. This can make it easier to manage the condition in the long run and prevent the epilepsy from progressing or becoming more difficult to treat later.\n*   **Predicting Future Needs:** Your son is still developing. As he grows, his metabolism and the way his body processes the medication will change. The neurologist might be anticipating this growth and adjusting the dosage proactively to maintain seizure control as he gets older.\n*   **Minor Symptoms (Auras) are still present:** The neurologist may also want to treat any auras that your son is experiencing.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Neurologist (To Gain More Clarity):**\n\n*   **What is the target therapeutic range for Keppra for my son's age and weight?** (Knowing this range helps you understand where your son's current dosage falls.)\n*   **What are the risks and benefits of increasing the dosage at this time?** (Specifically, ask about the potential side effects of the increased dosage and weigh them against the potential benefits of improved seizure control.)\n*   **What are the chances that increasing the dosage will eliminate the minor \"dizzy\" episodes?** (Understand the neurologist's expectations for the outcome of the dosage increase.)\n*   **Is there a monitoring plan in place to assess the effectiveness of the increased dosage and to monitor for side effects?** (Ask about how you'll know if the higher dosage is working and if it's causing any problems.)\n*   **If we don't increase the dosage now, what are the potential risks?** (This helps you understand the potential consequences of maintaining the current dosage.)\n*   **Can we stay on the current dosage and monitor the situation closely before increasing it?** (Sometimes a \"wait and see\" approach is reasonable, especially if you're concerned about side effects.)\n*   **Are there any blood tests or other monitoring tools that can help determine if the current dosage is adequate?**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Side Effects:** Be very vigilant about monitoring your son for any side effects of Keppra. Common side effects can include fatigue, irritability, mood changes, and appetite changes. Report any concerns to your neurologist promptly.\n*   **Open Communication:** The key is to have an open and honest conversation with your neurologist. Express your concerns and ask your questions until you feel comfortable with the treatment plan.\n*   **Second Opinion (Optional):** If you still feel uncertain after discussing it with your neurologist, you could consider getting a second opinion from another pediatric neurologist.\n\n**In summary,** it's wise to be cautious and ask questions. The neurologist's recommendation might be perfectly sound, but you have the right to understand the reasoning and to participate actively in your son's care. By having a thorough discussion with your neurologist, you can make an informed decision that you feel good about.\n"

Let's break down the situation and try to address your anxieties:\n\n**Likelihood of it being related to the tetanus shot:**\n\n*   **Highly plausible:** The location of the swelling (above the clavicle, presumably on the same side as the tetanus shot) strongly suggests it's a localized lymph node reaction to the vaccine. Lymph nodes in that area drain the arm where you received the injection.\n*   **Mechanism:** Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system. Lymph nodes are crucial for this process, as they're where immune cells encounter the vaccine antigens and mount a response. This response can cause the nodes to become temporarily enlarged and sometimes tender.\n*   **Timing:** The timing aligns perfectly. It's common for lymph node swelling to occur a few days to a week after vaccination.\n\n**Why Google can be misleading (and terrifying):**\n\n*   **Specificity vs. Sensitivity:** Google (and other search engines) prioritize sensitivity. They try to give you all possible answers, even rare ones. This means you'll see the worst-case scenarios listed alongside the more likely explanations.\n*   **Context is key:** Medical symptoms are rarely isolated events. Your overall health history, recent events (like the tetanus shot and cat scratch), and other symptoms provide crucial context that Google can't understand.\n*   **Lymph nodes are complex:** Swollen lymph nodes are common, and the vast majority are caused by benign or self-limiting conditions, especially infections or vaccinations.\n\n**Other factors to consider (besides the tetanus shot):**\n\n*   **Cat Scratch:** Even though you've finished antibiotics, the cat scratch itself could still be contributing to the lymph node swelling. Even with antibiotics, the body needs to clear the remaining inflammatory response.\n*   **Amoxicillin/Clavulanate:** While less likely, drug reactions can sometimes cause lymph node swelling. However, this is less common than a reaction to the tetanus vaccine or the infection itself.\n*   **Your Medical History:**\n    *   **Graves' Disease:** While your Graves' disease is currently in remission, autoimmune conditions can sometimes flare up or have lingering effects on the immune system.\n    *   **Low Lymphocyte Count:** This *could* indicate some degree of immune system impairment, although a level of 0.9 is only mildly low. However, low lymphocyte counts don't typically cause lymph node swelling; they are more often associated with an increased risk of infection.\n    *   **Elevated Liver Value:** This is something to monitor with your doctor, but it's unlikely to be directly related to the current lymph node swelling.\n\n**What to do in the meantime (before your appointment):**\n\n*   **Avoid poking or prodding the lymph node.** This can further irritate it.\n*   **Monitor for other symptoms:** Pay attention to any redness, warmth, or tenderness around the injection site or lymph node. Check for fever, chills, or night sweats (although these are less likely).\n*   **Take a deep breath and try to relax.** I know this is easier said than done, but try to avoid excessive Googling and focus on the likelihood that this is a benign reaction.\n*   **Note the size and consistency:** Gently palpate the lymph node each day and note any changes in size, tenderness, or consistency (hard, soft, mobile, fixed). This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n\n**At your doctor's appointment:**\n\n*   **Be sure to mention everything you've told me:** The timing of the tetanus shot, the cat scratch, the antibiotics, your history of Graves' disease and the blood results you mentioned.\n*   **Ask specific questions:**\n    *   \"Given the timing of the tetanus shot and the location of the swelling, how likely is it that this is a reaction to the vaccine?\"\n    *   \"What are the 'red flags' that would suggest this is something more serious that needs further investigation?\"\n    *   \"Would observation be a reasonable approach initially, or do you recommend any tests at this point?\"\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe most likely explanation for the lump is a reaction to the tetanus shot. It's also possible that the cat scratch is contributing. Given your medical history, it's wise to have it checked out by your doctor, but try to stay calm and remember that the vast majority of swollen lymph nodes are benign. Focus on providing your doctor with a clear and complete history, and ask them your specific questions to address your concerns.\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your concern. Missing a dose of anti-epileptic medication, especially when driving is involved, is definitely something to take seriously. Since you're waiting on your doctor's advice, here's a breakdown of factors and things to consider, remembering that this is *not* a replacement for your doctor's personalized medical guidance.\n\n**Things to Consider:**\n\n*   **Individual Sensitivity:** How sensitive are you to missed doses? Have you missed doses before? If so, what happened? Did you experience any aura symptoms?\n*   **Seizure Type & History:** What kind of seizures do you have? How well controlled are they *normally* on your current medication regimen? How long have you been seizure-free?\n*   **Phenobarbital's Half-Life:** Phenobarbital has a *very* long half-life (typically 48-96 hours). This is good, because it means a single missed dose will have less of an immediate impact compared to Vimpat.\n*   **Vimpat's Half-Life:** As you mentioned, Vimpat has a shorter half-life (around 12 hours). This means blood levels can drop more significantly with a missed dose.\n*   **Stress & Triggers:** Are you anticipating increased stress this week due to your important tasks? Stress is a common seizure trigger for many people. Are there any other known triggers you might encounter while driving or during your planned activities (e.g., flashing lights, sleep deprivation)?\n*   **Driving Restrictions:** Do you have any state-mandated driving restrictions related to your epilepsy (e.g., seizure-free period required before driving)?\n\n**Why You Might Be Okay:**\n\n*   **Phenobarbital's Buffer:** The long half-life of phenobarbital provides a more stable baseline level of seizure control. It acts as a buffer against fluctuations.\n*   **One-Time Missed Dose:** A single, isolated missed dose is often less problematic than consistently missing doses.\n*   **You Took It Eventually:** You didn't skip the dose entirely; you just took it late.\n*   **Individual Variation:** Some people are less sensitive to missed doses than others.\n\n**Why You Might Need to Be Extra Cautious:**\n\n*   **Driving:** Driving is inherently risky, and even a brief lapse in awareness due to seizure activity can have devastating consequences. This is the biggest concern here.\n*   **Vimpat Level Drop:** The significant drop in Vimpat level could increase seizure risk, especially if you are normally well-controlled.\n*   **Unpredictability:** Epilepsy is often unpredictable. Even if you've been stable for a long time, a breakthrough seizure is always a possibility.\n\n**What You Can Do (While Waiting for Your Doctor):**\n\n*   **Increased Awareness:** Pay *very* close attention to your body. Be hyper-aware of any pre-seizure symptoms (aura, unusual sensations, etc.).\n*   **Avoid Triggers:** Do your best to minimize any potential seizure triggers. Get enough sleep, eat regularly, manage stress.\n*   **Consider Alternate Transportation:** If possible, explore alternative transportation options for your important tasks this week. Can you carpool with someone? Use public transportation? Reschedule tasks that require driving?\n*   **Inform Others:** Tell someone close to you (family, friend, colleague) about the missed dose and your concerns. Ask them to be aware of you and your situation this week.\n*   **Document:** Keep a log of any unusual symptoms or feelings you experience. This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n*   **Do Not Drink Alcohol:** Absolutely avoid alcohol. It can lower your seizure threshold and interfere with your medications.\n*   **Be Extra Careful with Machinery:** Avoid operating heavy machinery or engaging in other potentially dangerous activities until you're confident that you're stable.\n\n**When Will You Know You're \"In the Clear\"?**\n\nThere's no definitive answer, but here's a general idea:\n\n*   **Next Dose:** Once you take your next scheduled dose of both medications, you'll start to replenish the Vimpat level.\n*   **Several Doses:** It may take a few doses (perhaps 1-2 days) for your Vimpat levels to stabilize back to their normal therapeutic range.\n*   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continue to be extra vigilant for the entire week, even after you've taken several doses.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\n*   **This is *not* medical advice.** This information is for general knowledge and discussion purposes only. It's essential to follow your doctor's specific instructions and recommendations. Your doctor has the best understanding of your medical history and current condition.\n*   **Err on the side of caution.** When it comes to driving and seizure risk, it's always better to be overly cautious.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nMissing a dose is always a concern, but the combination of Phenobarbital's long half-life and the fact that you took the dose eventually offers some reassurance. However, the potential drop in Vimpat levels, combined with the need to drive, warrants extra caution. Prioritize your safety and follow your doctor's advice. Good luck, and I hope you get a prompt response from your doctor!\n"

    "question": "28F. 5'8, 250lbs. White. History of epilepsy, asthma and vitamin D & B12 deficiency. Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a lot to unpack, and I understand your concern. A FSH of 122.2 mIU/mL, especially in someone your age, is very concerning and strongly suggests the possibility of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature menopause. Let's break down your questions:\n\n**1. Chances of Reproductive Organs Spontaneously Starting Again After 6 Months of Amenorrhea and High FSH:**\n\n*   **Lower Probability, but Not Impossible:** Unfortunately, with such a high FSH level and 6 months of amenorrhea, the chances of your ovaries spontaneously resuming normal function are relatively low. However, it is important to remember that things are never impossible.\n\n**2. What Could Cause This?**\n\n*   Several factors can cause premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), and sometimes the cause is unknown (idiopathic):\n    *   **Genetic Factors:** This is a common cause.\n        *   **Chromosome Abnormalities:** Such as Turner syndrome (though less likely, it can have mosaic forms) or Fragile X premutation.\n        *   **Gene Mutations:** Mutations in genes involved in ovarian development or function.\n    *   **Autoimmune Disorders:** Your immune system mistakenly attacks your ovaries. This is more likely if you have other autoimmune conditions (though you haven't mentioned any).\n    *   **Medical Treatments:**\n        *   **Chemotherapy:** Certain chemotherapy drugs can damage the ovaries.\n        *   **Radiation Therapy:** Radiation to the pelvic area can also cause POI.\n        *   **Ovarian Surgery:** Surgery that removes or damages the ovaries.\n    *   **Infections:** Rare, but some infections can affect ovarian function.\n    *   **Enzyme Deficiencies:** Like Galactosemia.\n    *   **Environmental Factors:** Exposure to toxins (e.g., smoking, pesticides) has been linked to earlier menopause.\n    *   **Idiopathic:** In many cases, the cause of POI remains unknown.\n\n**3. What Should You Be Worried About?**\n\n*   **Confirmation of Diagnosis:** It's good that your doctor is retesting. FSH levels can fluctuate, so repeat testing is essential. Also, estrogen level testing will help provide more insight.\n*   **Long-Term Health Risks:** POI is not just about fertility. The lack of estrogen can lead to several long-term health risks:\n    *   **Bone Loss (Osteoporosis):** Estrogen is crucial for bone health.\n    *   **Cardiovascular Disease:** Estrogen has a protective effect on the heart.\n    *   **Cognitive Function:** There is some evidence suggesting estrogen plays a role in cognitive health, and POI may increase the risk of cognitive decline.\n    *   **Mood Changes:** Depression, anxiety, and irritability are common due to hormonal changes.\n    *   **Vaginal Dryness and Atrophy:** This can lead to painful intercourse and urinary problems.\n*   **Fertility:** If you desire future pregnancies, this is a major concern. Unfortunately, natural conception is rare with POI. Options to discuss with a fertility specialist include:\n    *   **Egg Donation:** Using eggs from a donor.\n    *   **Adoption:**\n*   **Psychological Impact:** POI can be emotionally devastating, especially at a young age. It's important to acknowledge your feelings and seek support.\n\n**4. Does This Just Happen Sometimes?**\n\n*   While it's true that POI can occur spontaneously, it's not considered \"just something that happens sometimes\" without investigation. It is an uncommon condition.\n*   **Idiopathic POI:** In cases where no specific cause is identified, it is labeled idiopathic, but that doesn't mean it's without consequence.\n\n**Next Steps & Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Follow Up with Your PCP:** Make sure you get those repeat blood tests done as scheduled. Discuss the results thoroughly.\n2.  **Referral to a Reproductive Endocrinologist:** This is crucial. A reproductive endocrinologist specializes in hormonal and reproductive issues and can provide expert guidance on diagnosis, management, and fertility options.\n3.  **Consider a Genetic Evaluation:** Given your age, it would be beneficial to undergo genetic testing to look for chromosomal abnormalities or gene mutations associated with POI.\n4.  **Bone Density Scan (DEXA Scan):** To assess bone health.\n5.  **Cardiovascular Risk Assessment:** Your doctor should assess your cardiovascular risk factors and recommend appropriate management strategies.\n6.  **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** This is often recommended to manage symptoms and reduce long-term health risks associated with estrogen deficiency. Discuss the risks and benefits of HRT with your doctor.\n7.  **Mental Health Support:** Consider seeking counseling or therapy to cope with the emotional impact of POI. Support groups can also be helpful.\n8.  **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Healthy Diet:** Focus on calcium and vitamin D-rich foods.\n    *   **Regular Exercise:** Weight-bearing exercise is important for bone health.\n    *   **Avoid Smoking:** Smoking can worsen bone loss and cardiovascular risk.\n    *   **Manage Stress:**\n\n**Important Considerations in Light of Your Medical History:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy and Lamotrigine:** It's important to discuss HRT with your neurologist, as some hormone therapies can potentially interact with Lamotrigine or affect seizure threshold.\n*   **Asthma:** Estrogen can sometimes affect asthma symptoms. Your doctor will need to monitor your asthma closely if you start HRT.\n*   **Vitamin Deficiencies:** Continue taking your vitamin D and B12 supplements as prescribed.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe high FSH level and lack of menstruation strongly suggest POI. While spontaneous resumption of ovarian function is unlikely, it's essential to confirm the diagnosis, investigate potential causes, and manage the long-term health risks. A reproductive endocrinologist is your best resource for navigating this complex situation. Don't hesitate to advocate for your health and seek the best possible care.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

    "question": "A few years back while In the military I had a freak accident until it stopped being that and continued to occur day after day. After some months I was diagnosed with epilepsy.In the beginning I was having 1-3 seizures a day while 2-4 of those were grand mal seizures a month. Medications didn\u2019t work and just seemed to make everything worse so my neurologist made the decision to not give me medications after having tried 5 of them.It\u2019s been a few years now and nowadays I get anywhere from 2-5? Every 4months and about 2 or 3 of those are grand mal seizures. A significant decrease but still ongoing. We never found a cause for the seizures.Well I\u2019m asking because a few months back I started noticing a few things that started worrying me. For example,    a few years back and at the beginning of this I used to be \u201csmart\u201d as in I could write any word no matter how big or small but in recent months I\u2019ve noticed I have a really hard time writing, as in spelling out words. I used to full on turn on autocorrect on my phone but nowadays I find myself almost completely depending on my phones autocorrect and looking up word spellings when even my phone can\u2019t tell what I\u2019m trying to say.    with writing again, for some reason I find myself forgetting or I don\u2019t know, not using simple words such as \u201cthe\u201d \u201cof\u201d \u201cto\u201d \u201cand\u201d \u201cfrom\u201d etc. or sometimes mistaking one word for another when there\u2019s no connection between the two    same thing as above but with speech. I never had any speed impediment or any speech disorder prior but now I find myself getting \u201cstuck\u201d while trying to say a word. It\u2019s to the point where it\u2019ll happen at least once with every full sentence I try to speak. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ll see it happening and I\u2019ll try to say the word again and I won\u2019t be able to, I\u2019ll need to dramatically slow down my speech and literally say it in segments    dramatic increase in repeatedly forgetting. I\u2019ll forget my keys, go back and get them, get there and forget what I was going to get or sometimes I\u2019ll forget I forgot. So I\u2019ll go back, then head back out and be like \u201cI went back for my keys and came back without my keys\u201d Male 23 5\u201911 185lbs first diagnosed at 20.

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is definitely concerning, and it's important to discuss these new developments with a doctor, preferably a neurologist. Here's a breakdown of why and what you should consider:\n\n**Why This Is Concerning:**\n\n*   **Cognitive Decline:** The issues you're describing (spelling difficulties, forgetting common words, speech impediments, memory problems) strongly suggest a cognitive decline. While some cognitive fluctuations can be normal, these appear to be a significant change for you and warrant investigation.\n*   **Epilepsy and Cognitive Function:** Epilepsy can sometimes cause cognitive problems, even in the absence of frequent seizures. This can be due to the seizures themselves, the underlying cause of the epilepsy (if there is one), or even from repeated subclinical seizure activity.\n*   **Brain Damage:** Given the frequency and severity of your seizures, especially those where you stopped breathing, there is a risk of brain damage. Brain damage can manifest in a wide variety of ways, including the cognitive changes you are experiencing.\n*   **Medication Effects (Past or Present):** Even though you aren't currently on medication, past medications could have lingering effects, or they might have interacted with your brain in ways that are contributing to your current issues.\n*   **Progressive Condition:** The fact that these problems are *new* and *worsening* is a red flag. It suggests that whatever is causing them is potentially progressive.\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Neurological Evaluation:** This is the most important step. You need to see a neurologist *as soon as possible*. Explain to the scheduling staff the urgency of your situation and the cognitive changes you're experiencing.\n2.  **Comprehensive Medical History:** Be prepared to provide the neurologist with a detailed medical history, including:\n    *   All of your seizure history (frequency, types, duration, any known triggers, any warning signs).\n    *   All medications you've taken, including dosages and durations.\n    *   Any other medical conditions you have.\n    *   Family history of epilepsy, neurological disorders, or cognitive decline.\n    *   History of head trauma or injuries (especially related to the military).\n3.  **Bring Detailed Notes:** Keep a daily log of your cognitive symptoms:\n    *   Examples of words you struggle to spell.\n    *   Specific instances of forgetting words in speech.\n    *   Memory lapses (what you forgot, when, and what the context was).\n    *   Anything else that seems unusual or different from your previous cognitive function.\n4.  **Potential Diagnostic Tests:** Be prepared for the neurologist to order a range of diagnostic tests, including:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This monitors brain activity and can help detect seizure activity, even if you're not actively having a seizure at the time of the test.\n    *   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of the Brain:** This provides detailed images of the brain and can help identify structural abnormalities that might be causing seizures or cognitive problems.\n    *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** This is a comprehensive assessment of your cognitive function, including memory, attention, language, and executive functions. It can help pinpoint specific areas of cognitive impairment.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, infections, or thyroid problems.\n5.  **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you are not satisfied with the evaluation or treatment plan you receive from the first neurologist, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist.\n6.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Be proactive in your care. Don't hesitate to ask questions, express your concerns, and advocate for the tests and treatments you think you need. Bring a family member or friend to appointments to help you remember details and advocate for you.\n7.  **Safety Precautions:** Given the memory issues and potential for seizures, take steps to ensure your safety:\n    *   Don't drive until your seizures are under better control and you have clearance from your neurologist.\n    *   Avoid activities that could be dangerous if you had a seizure (e.g., swimming alone, working at heights).\n    *   Let friends and family know about your condition and what to do if you have a seizure.\n8.  **Support Systems:** Find support groups for people with epilepsy and/or cognitive impairment. Sharing your experiences with others who understand can be incredibly helpful.\n\n**Possible Considerations During Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Encephalitis:** Though less common, it's important to rule out any potential inflammatory or infectious causes in the brain.\n*   **Tumors:** Although less likely, structural brain abnormalities such as a tumor could cause this.\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** It's important to differentiate the seizures that occur from PNES to see if this could be any underlying cause.\n\nThe changes you are describing warrant a comprehensive neurological evaluation to identify the cause and determine the best course of treatment. Don't delay in seeking medical attention. Your health is the priority.\n"

    "question": "Age/Sex: 20M Height: 5' 10\" Weight: 175 lbs About a month ago I swallowed roughly 42 grams of keppra. I eventually vomited, fell asleep, and woke up feeling pretty normal. I'm curious if there should be any hidden Long-term Health effects caused by my consumption of that much keppra that may not be obvious such as kidney, liver, or brain problems. Additionally, I am curious how likely it is I would have died from consuming that much Keppra and if a death from keppra would be painful.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're concerned about the potential long-term health effects and the immediate dangers of ingesting a large amount of Keppra (levetiracetam).  It's important to address this carefully:\n\n**I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.**\n\n**Here's what I can tell you based on general medical knowledge, but please, please see a doctor:**\n\n*   **High Dose Keppra Overdose - What Could Have Happened and Potential Long-Term Effects:**\n    *   **Likelihood of Death:** Levetiracetam (Keppra) is generally considered to have a relatively high safety profile, even in overdose situations. Deaths directly attributed to Keppra overdose alone are rare, but they *can* occur, especially if there are underlying health conditions or if the overdose is combined with other substances (alcohol, other drugs, etc.). The fact that you vomited likely reduced the amount of the drug absorbed into your system, which likely played a role in you not experiencing more severe effects.\n    *   **Symptoms of Overdose:** Common symptoms of Keppra overdose include:\n        *   Drowsiness, lethargy, and confusion\n        *   Agitation or aggression\n        *   Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing)\n        *   Seizures (paradoxically, Keppra is an anti-seizure medication, but overdose can trigger them)\n        *   Coma\n    *   **Potential Long-Term Effects:** While you feel okay now, it's crucial to be aware of potential delayed effects. Even though you felt okay after vomiting and sleeping, potential long-term effects could include:\n        *   **Kidney Problems:** Keppra is primarily cleared by the kidneys. A large dose could potentially strain the kidneys. Although significant permanent damage is unlikely in a single incident with no underlying kidney disease, it's worth checking kidney function.\n        *   **Liver Problems:** Although Keppra is not primarily metabolized by the liver, any medication overdose can put stress on the liver. Liver function tests are a good idea.\n        *   **Neurological Effects:** While less common, high doses of Keppra can potentially lead to prolonged neurological effects like cognitive impairment, mood changes, or motor coordination issues. These are usually temporary, but a neurological assessment could be helpful to check for subtle issues.\n\n*   **Painfulness of Death from Keppra Overdose (Hypothetical):**\n    *   If death were to occur from Keppra overdose (again, rare on its own), the cause would likely be related to respiratory depression or seizures leading to complications. Respiratory depression could lead to a feeling of suffocation. Seizures can be physically exhausting and potentially lead to injury. The experience would likely be distressing.\n\n**What You MUST Do:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor Immediately:**  Explain the situation to a doctor or go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room.  They need to evaluate your kidney and liver function with blood tests, assess your neurological status, and monitor you for any delayed effects.\n2.  **Be Honest:** It is important to be honest with your doctor about the amount of medication you ingested. This will help them provide the best care.\n3.  **Mental Health Evaluation:**  Ingesting a large amount of medication like this raises concerns about your mental health. Your doctor should also assess your mental state and provide resources for mental health support if needed.\n4.  **Avoid Self-Treating:** Do not try to manage any potential symptoms on your own.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The severity of an overdose depends on many factors, including your individual health, any other medications or substances you may have taken, and the time elapsed since ingestion.\n*   Even if you feel fine now, delayed complications can occur.\n*   **If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out for help immediately. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or text HOME to 741741.**\n\nIn summary, while a single Keppra overdose is often not fatal, it's critical to get checked out by a doctor to rule out any potential long-term health effects and to address any underlying mental health concerns. Please prioritize your health and seek professional medical attention immediately.\n"

    "answer": "Based on the information and the image you provided, the most likely explanation for the recurrent red patches on your tongue is **Geographic Tongue (Benign Migratory Glossitis)**.\n\nHere's why, and what you should do next:\n\n**Why Geographic Tongue is Likely:**\n\n*   **Appearance:** The description of red patches with white \"rings\" that change location over time is classic for geographic tongue.  The images confirm this visual pattern.\n*   **Recurrent Nature:**  The pattern of appearing and disappearing patches aligns with the migratory nature of the condition.\n*   **Pain:** The pain, especially with contact and a burning sensation, is common.\n*   **Duration:** The several-month duration is also consistent.\n*   **Association:** While not directly causal, geographic tongue can sometimes be associated with other inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune diseases, although the link is not definitively established.  Stress can also be a contributing factor.\n\n**While less likely, other considerations include:**\n\n*   **Aphthous Ulcers (Canker Sores):**  While these are painful and recurrent, they usually have a more distinct, ulcerated center and are less migratory in nature.\n*   **Oral Candidiasis (Thrush):**  While thrush can cause white patches, it's usually more widespread and easily wiped off, and the underlying tissue is often raw and bleeding. This doesn't seem to fit your description as the white \"ring\" only forms after a period of inflammation.\n*   **Drug-Induced Stomatitis:** Some medications can cause oral inflammation. While less likely to be the cause since it started about half a year ago, consider possible changes in dosage or new medications around this time.\n*   **Lupus-Related Oral Manifestations:** While SLE can cause oral ulcers, they typically present differently than what you describe. Neurologic involvement is rare.\n\n**Concerning your medication list and underlying conditions:**\n\n*   Your medication list is extensive and complex. Any new medication could theoretically be contributing but, as stated above, this is less likely to be the cause.\n*   The combination of autoimmune disease (SLE, Crohn's) and immune-modulating medications (Hydroxychloroquine, Methylprednisolone, Rituximab) could potentially influence the oral microbiome and increase susceptibility to inflammatory conditions.\n*   Stress and anxiety (which can be heightened by chronic illness) can sometimes exacerbate geographic tongue.\n\n**What to Do Next:**\n\n1.  **Confirm the Diagnosis:** *See a dentist first.* The dentist can clinically assess your tongue and rule out other potential causes. If the dentist is unsure, or if you want additional specialist confirmation:\n    *   *Oral Medicine Specialist:* This is the ideal specialist. They are experts in oral mucosal diseases. They can best diagnose and manage the condition.\n    *   *Oral Pathologist:* An oral pathologist could perform a biopsy if the diagnosis is uncertain.\n    *   *Dermatologist:* While a dermatologist *can* diagnose oral conditions, an oral medicine specialist is preferred if available. A dermatologist experienced with oral diseases would be an appropriate alternative.\n\n2.  **Manage Symptoms (while awaiting appointment):**\n\n    *   **Dietary Modifications:**\n        *   Avoid spicy, acidic (citrus fruits, tomatoes), and salty foods, as these can irritate the tongue.\n        *   Avoid very hot or very cold foods/drinks.\n        *   Avoid hard or crunchy foods that could cause friction.\n    *   **Oral Hygiene:**\n        *   Continue good oral hygiene with gentle brushing.\n        *   Avoid harsh mouthwashes (especially those containing alcohol).\n        *   Consider a bland, non-alcoholic mouthwash (e.g., baking soda rinse \u2013 1/2 teaspoon in 1 cup of warm water).\n    *   **Pain Relief:**\n        *   *Topical Anesthetics:*  Benzocaine-containing products (e.g., Orajel) can provide temporary pain relief.\n        *   *Topical Corticosteroids:*  Your doctor might prescribe a topical corticosteroid gel or mouthwash (e.g., fluocinonide) to reduce inflammation.  Use with caution and as directed, due to potential side effects.\n        *   *Lidocaine Viscous:* Your doctor might prescribe lidocaine viscous to numb the area.\n        *   *Over-the-counter pain relievers*:  Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with pain, but avoid long-term use.\n        *   *Avoid trigger foods*: Pay attention to which foods make it worse and avoid them.\n    *   **Stress Management:** If stress is a trigger, consider relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, meditation, yoga).\n\n3.  **Medication Review:** Discuss all your medications with the dentist or specialist. While less likely, they can assess if any are contributing to the problem. *Do not stop any medication without consulting your prescribing doctor.*\n\n4.  **Underlying Conditions:** Discuss with your rheumatologist (or the doctor managing your SLE) if the geographic tongue could be related to your underlying autoimmune conditions. It is important that your autoimmune diseases are well managed.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Biopsy:** If the diagnosis is uncertain, or if the lesions are atypical, a biopsy might be necessary to rule out other conditions.\n*   **Follow-Up:** Even if the diagnosis is geographic tongue, follow up with your dentist/specialist to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as needed.\n\nGeographic tongue is typically a benign condition, but the pain can be bothersome. A proper diagnosis and management plan can help improve your comfort and quality of life. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",

    "answer": "It's incredibly distressing to hear about what Fiona and your family are going through.  The fact that she's experiencing such severe episodes, and doctors haven't been able to pinpoint a cause, is understandably frustrating and concerning. While I absolutely cannot diagnose her, I can offer some potential avenues for exploration based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Important Considerations and Potential Avenues to Explore:**\n\n*   **Neurological Investigation is Key:** Despite the doctors saying it's \"not seizures,\" the symptoms you describe are very concerning and warrant a deeper neurological investigation. Here's what I would pursue:\n    *   **Repeat/Prolonged EEG Monitoring:**  A standard, short EEG may miss abnormalities.  Consider:\n        *   **Ambulatory EEG (AEEG):** This involves wearing an EEG device at home for 24-72 hours, capturing activity during her typical episode times.\n        *   **Video EEG Monitoring (VEEG):** Inpatient monitoring with continuous EEG and video recording can capture events and correlate brain activity with her symptoms.  This is often the best way to differentiate between epileptic seizures and other types of events.\n\n    *   **Neurological Consult with a Specialist:** This is critical. They need a specialist with expertise in:\n        *   **Epilepsy:** Even if initial EEGs are normal, a skilled epileptologist can review her case and consider other less common seizure types.\n        *   **Functional Neurological Disorders (FND):** If seizures are ruled out, FNDs, in which neurological symptoms are caused by changes in brain function rather than structural damage, can be considered.\n        *   **Headache Disorders in Children:** A pediatric headache specialist can assess if her episodes involve complex migraine variants.\n\n    *   **Advanced Brain Imaging:** If not already done, consider:\n        *   **High-Resolution MRI:**  To look for subtle structural abnormalities.\n        *   **Functional MRI (fMRI):** Might be helpful, especially if FND is being considered, to assess brain activity during different states.\n\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Migraines can present with unusual symptoms, especially in children. Some migraine variants to explore include:\n\n    *   **Hemiplegic Migraine:** This can cause temporary weakness on one side of the body, numbness, or speech difficulties, mimicking a stroke or seizure.\n    *   **Basilar Migraine:**  Can involve symptoms like dizziness, double vision, loss of coordination, and altered consciousness.\n    *   **Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome:**  Can sometimes be associated with migraines.\n    *   **Abdominal Migraine:** Often presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but can sometimes be accompanied by other neurological symptoms.\n\n*   **Consider Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** If neurological testing is repeatedly negative, FND needs to be considered. FND involves real symptoms caused by changes in how the brain functions, rather than structural damage. It's important to note:\n\n    *   **FND is NOT \"all in their head\":**  It's a legitimate neurological condition.\n    *   **Diagnosis requires a specialist:**  A neurologist with experience in FND is crucial.\n    *   **Treatment involves specialized therapies:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and physical therapy are often used.\n\n*   **Medication History - Detailed Review:** Even if Fiona is only taking Tylenol now, a meticulous review of *all* past medications is essential.  Some medications, even those taken in the past, can have long-term effects or withdrawal symptoms.\n\n*   **Rule Out Metabolic Disorders:** Some rare metabolic disorders can manifest with neurological symptoms. A geneticist or metabolic specialist may need to be consulted.\n\n*   **Toxicology Screening:** Especially if the cause is unclear, a comprehensive toxicology screen can rule out exposure to environmental toxins.\n\n*   **PANDAS/PANS:**  If the onset of symptoms was sudden and is associated with behavioral changes, consider PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections) or PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome).  These conditions involve immune responses that affect the brain.\n\n**What to Do Next (Actionable Steps):**\n\n1.  **Demand a Comprehensive Review:**  Schedule a meeting with the current medical team and demand a comprehensive review of Fiona's case. Ask for the specific reasons why they rule out seizures and other potential diagnoses.\n2.  **Seek a Second (or Third) Opinion:**  If you are not satisfied with the current medical care, seek a second or third opinion from specialists at different medical centers. Major pediatric hospitals are often a good place to start.\n3.  **Keep Detailed Records:** Maintain a detailed log of Fiona's episodes, including:\n\n    *   Date and time\n    *   Duration\n    *   Specific symptoms (shaking, twitching, numbness, pain, etc.)\n    *   Potential triggers (light, stress, food, etc.)\n    *   Any medications given and their effects\n    *   Video recordings of the episodes (if possible)\n4.  **Document EVERYTHING:** Keep records of all doctor's visits, test results, and medical advice. This will be invaluable for future consultations.\n5.  **Advocate for Fiona:** You are her advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and push for the necessary testing and referrals.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",

    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and want to get a head start on understanding the MRI results. It's good that you're going to see his neurologist soon, as they can provide the most tailored advice. However, I can offer some general information to help you in the meantime.\n\n**Understanding the MRI Report**\n\n*   **Interval Surgical Repair of Right Tegmen Mastoideum Encephalocele:** This confirms the prior surgery to fix the encephalocele in the tegmen mastoideum region (part of the temporal bone near the ear).\n*   **New Small Region of Encephalomalacia and Gliosis in the Adjacent Right Inferior Temporal and Parahippocampal Gyri:** This is the key finding.\n    *   **Encephalomalacia:** This refers to a softening or loss of brain tissue. It is often the result of injury, inflammation, or a lack of blood flow (ischemia). After a surgery, it essentially represents scar tissue where the brain tissue used to be.\n    *   **Gliosis:** This is the brain's response to injury. Glial cells (the support cells in the brain) proliferate to try and repair the damaged area. Gliosis is essentially a \"scar\" made of brain cells.\n\n*   **Amygdala and Hippocampi are Otherwise Relatively Symmetric with Normal Signal and Configuration:** This is reassuring, as these structures are important for memory and emotion, and the report suggests they appear normal.\n*   **No Evidence of Mass, Suspicious Enhancement, or Epileptogenic Focus Elsewhere in the Brain:** This means they didn't find any new tumors, areas of active inflammation, or other areas that might be causing seizures outside of the previously operated area.\n\n**Is Encephalomalacia/Gliosis Expected After a Lesionectomy?**\n\nYes, some degree of encephalomalacia and gliosis *is* expected after brain surgery, including a lesionectomy. The process of removing the encephalocele inevitably causes some damage to the surrounding tissue. It's essentially the brain's way of healing. The surgery itself can cause some trauma, and the brain's natural response to that trauma involves these processes.\n\n**What Does This Mean for Seizures?**\n\nThe appearance of new encephalomalacia and gliosis *could* potentially be related to the recurrence of seizures. Here's why:\n\n*   **Scar Tissue Can Be Epileptogenic:** Scar tissue, including gliosis, can sometimes become a focus for seizures. The abnormal electrical activity in the scar tissue can disrupt normal brain function and trigger a seizure. This is why seizures can sometimes recur even after successful surgery.\n*   **It Could Be Unrelated:** It is also possible that the encephalomalacia and gliosis are simply a result of the surgery, and something else is the cause.\n\n**Possible Courses of Treatment**\n\nHere's what to consider, understanding that your neurologist will have the best perspective:\n\n1.  **Medication Adjustment:** Given that the seizure recurrence is recent, the first line of treatment is likely to be adjusting or adding anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Increasing the dose of his current medication (Vimpat) or adding another ASM may be sufficient to control the seizures. This is often the preferred approach, especially if the seizures are infrequent or well-controlled with medication. He is currently on Vimpat, which may need to be adjusted, or other ASMs may be considered.\n2.  **Further Investigation:** It's possible the neurologist might want to get more detailed EEG studies (including prolonged or inpatient EEG monitoring) to better characterize the seizure activity and pinpoint its origin.\n3.  **Repeat Imaging:** It is possible that repeat MRI imaging will be requested to monitor how the lesion is changing over time.\n4.  **Surgery (Less Likely, But Possible):** It's less likely that repeat surgery would be immediately considered, especially if the seizures respond well to medication. However, surgery *could* be an option if:\n    *   The seizures are frequent and debilitating, and don't respond to multiple medications.\n    *   Further testing pinpoints a very specific area of epileptogenic activity within the encephalomalacia/gliosis that could be surgically targeted.\n    *   The risks of surgery are deemed to be acceptable given the potential benefits.\n    Even if another surgery were considered, it would likely be a very carefully considered decision after all other options have been explored.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Neurologist**\n\nHere are some questions to consider asking your neurologist:\n\n*   \"Is the encephalomalacia/gliosis the likely cause of the recurrent seizure?\"\n*   \"What is the plan for medication management, and what are the potential side effects?\"\n*   \"Do you recommend any further testing, such as a prolonged EEG?\"\n*   \"What are the long-term implications of the encephalomalacia/gliosis?\"\n*   \"What are the signs that the seizures are not being adequately controlled?\"\n*   \"What are the criteria that would lead us to consider further surgery?\"\n*   \"What lifestyle adjustments might help manage the epilepsy?\"\n\n**Important Points to Remember**\n\n*   **Don't Panic:** A single seizure doesn't necessarily mean that all the progress from the initial surgery has been undone.\n*   **Seizure Management is Often a Process:** Finding the right medication and dosage can take time.\n*   **Be Open and Honest with Your Neurologist:** Share all your concerns and observations about your husband's symptoms.\n*   **Advocate for Your Husband:** Be active in the decision-making process.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. I know this is a stressful time. Focus on gathering information, working closely with your neurologist, and supporting your husband.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n"

I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation.

    "answer": "It's understandable that you're curious and a little concerned about the new sensations you're experiencing, especially given your history and the recent epilepsy diagnosis. Let's break down your questions about synesthesia and its possible connection to your situation.\n\n**Synesthesia: Science or Pseudoscience?**\n\nSynesthesia is absolutely a real, documented neurological phenomenon, and definitely *not* pseudoscience. It's a condition where stimulation of one sense triggers experiences in another sense. Researchers have used various brain imaging techniques (fMRI, EEG) to observe differences in the brains of synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes. These studies have shown:\n\n*   **Increased connectivity:** Synesthetes often have more connections between brain areas that process different senses.\n*   **Increased activation:** When a synesthete experiences a triggering stimulus (e.g., seeing a color), the brain areas associated with the secondary sense (e.g., taste) also become active.\n\nThe existence of synesthesia is well-established within the scientific community. However, the specific mechanisms and reasons why it occurs in some people and not others are still being researched.\n\n**Could This Be Synesthesia?**\n\nBased on your description, what you're experiencing *could* be a form of synesthesia. Specifically, it sounds like you might be experiencing:\n\n*   **Tactile-emotional synesthesia:** Feeling sensations related to emotions or experiences depicted on screen (hugs, pain). This aligns with the \"feeling things you see.\"\n*   **Spatial-sensory synesthesia:** Experiencing smells and tactile sensations associated with environments you see (National Geographic).\n\nIt's important to note that there are many different types of synesthesia, and its presentation can vary widely from person to person.\n\n**Potential Causes & Concerns**\n\nGiven your medical history and the timing of these sensations, here are some possible explanations to consider and discuss with your doctors:\n\n1.  **Epilepsy and Anti-Epileptic Medication (Lamictal):** While your neurologist doesn't think it's a seizure, it's important to remember that the brain is complex. Here's why this is still relevant:\n\n    *   **Subclinical Seizures:** Sometimes seizures don't cause obvious convulsions but can manifest as unusual sensory experiences or alterations in perception. These are called subclinical seizures.\n    *   **Medication-Induced Changes:** While less common, medications can sometimes alter brain function in unexpected ways. Lamotrigine (Lamictal) has been associated with some neurological and psychiatric side effects in rare cases.\n    *   **Brain Plasticity:** Controlling seizures can allow the brain to reorganize itself. This reorganization, though beneficial in controlling seizures, could potentially unmask or trigger pre-existing synesthetic tendencies or even create new connections.\n2.  **Mental Health:** Your history of postpartum psychosis and depression should be considered. While you're not actively experiencing a mental health crisis, changes in sensory perception can sometimes be associated with underlying anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions.\n3.  **Medication Interactions:** Cymbalta and Lamictal can sometimes have interactions that influence neurological function. It's worth reviewing your medication list with your doctor or pharmacist.\n4.  **Unrelated Synesthesia:** It's possible that you always had a mild form of synesthesia that went unnoticed or unacknowledged until recently. Perhaps the changes in your brain activity due to the epilepsy and medication have made it more prominent.\n5.  **Thoracic Aneurysm**: Though this is unlikely, it is important to mention as a possibility. Rarely aneurysms can put pressure on nerves causing odd sensations.\n\n**Is This a Sign of a Downward Turn?**\n\nIt's difficult to say. Many people with synesthesia live normal, healthy lives, and it doesn't necessarily indicate a deteriorating mental state. The fact that you find these sensations pleasant is a good sign. *However*, given your history, it's prudent to monitor these experiences and report any significant changes to your doctor.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Detailed Discussion with Your Neurologist:** Schedule a follow-up appointment to specifically discuss your concerns about synesthesia. Explain the sensations in detail, including the triggers and the specific experiences you have. Ask about the possibility of further neurological testing (e.g., EEG) to rule out subclinical seizure activity.\n2.  **Consultation with a Psychiatrist/Psychologist:** Consider discussing these sensations with a mental health professional, especially given your history. They can help determine if these experiences are related to underlying anxiety or depression.\n3.  **Medication Review:** Review your medications with your doctor or pharmacist to check for potential interactions or side effects. Don't change any dosages without professional guidance.\n4.  **Keep a Journal:** Document your experiences, including triggers, sensations, intensity, and any accompanying emotions. This will provide valuable information for your healthcare providers.\n5.  **Address Nicotine Use:** While you've made great strides in quitting cigarettes, continuing to use nicotine through vaping can have negative impacts on both your physical and mental health. Nicotine can affect seizure threshold and anxiety levels, which could indirectly influence your sensory experiences. Talk to your doctor about resources to help you quit vaping.\n6.  **Research:** Learn more about synesthesia. There are many resources available online and in libraries. Understanding the phenomenon better may help alleviate some of your anxiety.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nSynesthesia is a real and fascinating neurological phenomenon. While it's possible that what you're experiencing is a form of synesthesia, it's important to rule out other potential causes, especially given your medical history. Open and honest communication with your healthcare providers is key to determining the best course of action and ensuring your overall well-being. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek further evaluation if you remain concerned.\n"

    "answer": "Okay, I understand you're concerned about the new findings on your MRI and want a clearer explanation to alleviate your anxiety. I'll break down the \"Brain\" and \"Impression\" sections of the report in a way that's easy to understand.\n\n**Understanding the Terms**\n\n*   **T2/FLAIR:** These are specific types of MRI sequences (ways the MRI scanner takes pictures). They are very sensitive to fluid and can highlight areas of abnormality in the brain tissue.\n*   **White Matter:** This is the tissue in the brain that contains nerve fibers, which are insulated by a fatty substance called myelin. White matter is responsible for transmitting signals between different areas of the brain.\n*   **Signal Abnormality:** This means that an area on the MRI scan looks different from the surrounding tissue. It lights up brighter on the T2/FLAIR sequences. This can be caused by various things, including inflammation, damage, or changes in the tissue structure.\n*   **Punctate Foci:** These are small, dot-like spots or areas.\n*   **Microvascular Ischemic Change:** This refers to small areas of damage caused by a lack of blood flow to tiny blood vessels in the brain. This can happen over time due to high blood pressure, diabetes, or other factors that affect blood vessel health.\n*   **Demyelinating Disease:** This refers to conditions that damage the myelin sheath, the protective covering around nerve fibers. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known demyelinating disease, but there are others.\n\n**Explanation of the \"Brain\" Section**\n\n*   **\"No mass effect or edema.\"** This is good news. It means there's no tumor (mass) pressing on other parts of the brain, and there's no swelling (edema).\n*   **\"No significant atrophy or chronic microvascular ischemic changes.\"** This also is reassuring. It means there is no significant shrinking (atrophy) of brain tissue and no significant evidence of long-standing damage from impaired blood flow.\n*   **\"Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right.\"** This is the key new finding. It means there are a few small, bright spots on the MRI in the white matter of the right side of your brain. These spots are being detected by the T2 and FLAIR sequences, indicating something is different in those specific areas.\n\n**Explanation of the \"Impression\" Section**\n\n*   **\"Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right which may be related to microvascular ischemic change with demyelinating disease not excluded.\"** This is where the radiologist (the doctor who reads the MRI) gives their interpretation of what those bright spots *might* be. They are saying that these spots *could* be caused by:\n    *   **Microvascular ischemic change:** As explained above, small areas of damage due to reduced blood flow in tiny vessels. Given your age, this is a fairly common finding and often related to risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or smoking history.\n    *   **Demyelinating disease not excluded:** This means that while it's *possible* the spots are related to a demyelinating disease like MS, the MRI findings aren't definitive enough to confirm it. \"Not excluded\" simply means it's a possibility that needs to be considered, but it's far from a diagnosis.\n\n**What Does This All Mean for You?**\n\n1.  **The findings are not necessarily alarming:** The radiologist is simply noting the presence of these spots and suggesting possible causes. The fact that they are \"few\" and \"punctate\" suggests they are not extensive.\n2.  **Correlation with Clinical Picture is Key:** These MRI findings need to be interpreted in the context of your overall health, symptoms (migraines and headaches), and neurological examination.\n3.  **Further Evaluation May Be Needed:** Your doctor will likely want to discuss these findings with you in more detail and may recommend further evaluation. This might include:\n    *   **Neurological Exam:** To assess your neurological function (strength, reflexes, coordination, sensation, etc.).\n    *   **Review of Medical History:** To identify any risk factors for microvascular disease (high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, etc.).\n    *   **Possibly, Further Imaging:** In some cases, another MRI with contrast (a special dye injected into your bloodstream) might be recommended to better characterize the spots and rule out other possibilities. This might be done after a period of time.\n    *   **Consideration of Other Causes:** Depending on your symptoms and medical history, your doctor may also consider other potential causes of white matter abnormalities, such as migraine-related changes, inflammation, or even normal variations.\n\n**Why You Shouldn't Panic**\n\n*   **White matter abnormalities are relatively common, especially as we age.** Many people have these spots on their MRI, and they don't always indicate a serious problem.\n*   **Your epilepsy likely isn't the primary cause for these changes.** While epilepsy can sometimes have associated brain changes, the report specifically mentions possibilities like microvascular ischemic change and demyelinating disease.\n*   **\"Not excluded\" doesn't mean \"confirmed.\"** The radiologist is simply being thorough in considering all possibilities.\n\n**What to Do Now**\n\n1.  **Schedule an Appointment:** The most important thing is to schedule an appointment with your neurologist to discuss the MRI report. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual situation.\n2.  **Prepare Questions:** Write down any questions you have about the MRI findings and bring them to your appointment.\n3.  **Be Open and Honest:** Share all your symptoms and concerns with your doctor. The more information you provide, the better they can help you.\n\nI hope this explanation has helped alleviate some of your anxiety. Remember, I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. It is essential to discuss these findings with your doctor for proper evaluation and management.\n"

    "question": "23M, 6\u20195 and wondering if liquid nytol is okay to use with a very mild form of epilepsy (no seizures) that is triggered by light.On no other medications but have ADHD and anxiety and can\u2019t sleep anymore",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. I am an AI and cannot give medical advice, so it is important to consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional before starting any new medication, including over-the-counter options like Nytol.\n\nHere's a summary of the considerations and things to discuss with your doctor:\n\n**Key Concerns & Why You Need to Talk to a Doctor:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy & Light Sensitivity:** Even if you're not having seizures, the fact that you have light-triggered epilepsy (photosensitivity) means certain medications can potentially affect your neurological activity.  Some antihistamines (like the one in Nytol) can, in rare cases, lower the seizure threshold. This is a serious consideration, and your doctor needs to assess the risk in your specific case.\n\n*   **ADHD & Anxiety:** These conditions often have complex relationships with sleep.  Some medications used for ADHD can disrupt sleep. Anxiety itself is a major cause of insomnia.  It's important to address the underlying causes of your sleep problems, not just mask them with a sleep aid.  Also, it's crucial to consider how any sleep aid might interact with your ADHD and anxiety, even if you're not currently taking medication for them.\n\n*   **Nytol Ingredients:** Liquid Nytol typically contains Diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties. While it can induce sleep, it can also have side effects, including:\n\n    *   **Next-day drowsiness:** This can impact your alertness and cognitive function.\n    *   **Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention:** These are common anticholinergic side effects.\n    *   **Cognitive impairment, especially in older adults:** While you're young, long-term use could potentially have effects.\n    *   **Paradoxical Excitement:** In some people, especially children, diphenhydramine can cause the opposite effect \u2013 hyperactivity and agitation.\n    *   **Interaction with other medications/conditions:** This is where the epilepsy is particularly important.\n\n*   **Long-Term Use & Tolerance:** Over-the-counter sleep aids like Nytol are generally *not* recommended for long-term use. Your body can develop a tolerance, meaning you'll need higher doses to get the same effect, and this can exacerbate side effects. Also, relying on medication can prevent you from addressing the underlying causes of your insomnia.\n\n*   **Height and Weight:** While not usually a major factor with Diphenhydramine, it's always good to tell your doctor your height and weight so that they can assess risks for your specific body type.\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Doctor:**\n\n1.  **Your Epilepsy:**  Explain the type of epilepsy you have (photosensitivity) and that it's currently well-managed (no seizures). Provide details about any past neurological evaluations or recommendations.\n2.  **Your Insomnia:** Describe how long you've been experiencing insomnia, how it affects your daily life, and any potential triggers you've identified (stress, screen time, etc.).\n3.  **Your ADHD and Anxiety:** Discuss these conditions, even if you're not currently medicated. They are important pieces of the puzzle.\n4.  **Your Medication History:**  List any medications you've taken in the past, including any for ADHD, anxiety, or sleep. Also, mention any allergies or sensitivities you have.\n5.  **Nytol (Diphenhydramine):** Ask specifically about the safety of using liquid Nytol (diphenhydramine) given your epilepsy and other conditions.  Ask about the potential for it to lower your seizure threshold.\n6.  **Alternative Solutions:** Ask your doctor about alternative approaches to managing your insomnia, such as:\n    *   **Sleep hygiene:**  Establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, optimizing your sleep environment (dark, quiet, cool), and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):** This is a highly effective, non-medication treatment for insomnia.\n    *   **Melatonin:**  A natural hormone that can help regulate sleep-wake cycles.  Discuss appropriate dosage with your doctor.\n    *   **Prescription Sleep Medications:** If other approaches are not effective, your doctor may consider prescribing a sleep medication.  They will carefully weigh the risks and benefits in your case.\n    *   **Anxiety Management:** Addressing your anxiety through therapy, medication, or other techniques can also improve your sleep.\n\n**In summary: Do not take liquid Nytol without first discussing it with your doctor. Your medical history, especially your epilepsy, requires professional evaluation before using any medication that could potentially affect your neurological system. They can provide personalized advice and explore safer, more effective long-term solutions for your insomnia.**\n"

    "question": " 50F in Australia, on carbimazole and levetiracetam for Graves\u2019 and epilepsy, respectively. FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, given your situation, let's break down the factors and consider the best course of action:\n\n**Factors to Consider:**\n\n*   **Mechanism of Injury (FOOSH):** A \"Fall On OutStretched Hand\" is a common mechanism for wrist fractures, especially scaphoid fractures, distal radius fractures (Colles' fracture), and other carpal bone injuries.\n*   **Pain Location:** Pain at the base of the thumb, particularly with gripping and radiating down the inside of the wrist, is concerning for a scaphoid fracture, or possibly a fracture/sprain of the thumb itself (Bennett's or Rolando's fracture).  It could also be a ligament injury around the thumb (e.g., skier's thumb - UCL injury).\n*   **Pain Intensity & Disruption:** The pain disrupted your sleep and causes shooting pain with specific movements (like using the toothbrush). This suggests more than a minor sprain.\n*   **Persistent Numbness (Initial):** While the numbness resolved, the initial numbness is worth noting, as it *could* indicate nerve compression at the time of the injury.\n*   **Underlying Medical Conditions:**\n    *   **Graves' Disease and Carbimazole:** While Graves' disease itself doesn't directly increase fracture risk, long-term carbimazole use *can* potentially affect bone density in some individuals (though not always).\n    *   **Epilepsy and Levetiracetam:** Levetiracetam itself doesn't typically impact bone health. However, the *cause* of your epilepsy (if it's related to an underlying condition) and the possibility of seizures (which *can* lead to falls) are relevant considerations.\n*   **Availability of Medical Care:** The radiology office is closed for the weekend, and the medical center suggested the ED if you want immediate imaging.\n\n**Why the Concern for Scaphoid Fracture?**\n\n*   **Mechanism of injury.**\n*   **Pain location:** Pain at the base of your thumb and inside your wrist is a classic presentation of a scaphoid fracture. This bone is critical for wrist stability and function.\n*   **Delayed Presentation/Subtle Symptoms:** Scaphoid fractures can sometimes be subtle at first. The pain might not be excruciating, and swelling may be minimal.\n*   **Risk of Non-Union:** Scaphoid fractures have a high risk of *non-union* (failure to heal properly) if not diagnosed and treated promptly. This can lead to chronic pain, weakness, arthritis, and the need for surgery.\n*   **Disrupted blood supply:** The blood supply to the scaphoid comes from the distal end of the bone, meaning that a fracture through the midsection can potentially compromise blood supply to the proximal section and lead to necrosis and/or non-union.\n\n**Arguments for Waiting Until Monday:**\n\n*   **Not Excruciating Pain:** If the pain is manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers (paracetamol/acetaminophen is generally preferred with your medications, consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific advice), and you can avoid using the wrist, you *might* be able to wait.\n*   **ED Wait Times:** Emergency Departments can be very busy, and you might face a long wait for an X-ray.\n*   **Potential for Conservative Management:** A minor sprain *could* improve with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) over the weekend.\n\n**Arguments for Going to the ED (or Urgent Care) Sooner:**\n\n*   **Suspicion of Scaphoid Fracture:** Due to the pain location and mechanism, it is likely.\n*   **Risk of Non-Union:** The potential consequences of a missed scaphoid fracture are significant. Early diagnosis and treatment (immobilization with a splint or cast) greatly improve the chances of proper healing.\n*   **Pain Disruption:** The fact that the pain is interfering with your sleep suggests it's not a minor injury.\n*   **To Rule Out Other Fractures/Ligament Injuries:** An X-ray can help rule out other carpal bone fractures or dislocations, as well as distal radius fractures.\n*   **Pain Control:** The ED can provide stronger pain relief if needed.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nGiven all of the above, *I lean towards advising you to seek medical attention sooner rather than later.* It's difficult to give definitive advice without examining you, but the concern for a scaphoid fracture is high enough that it warrants prompt investigation.\n\nHere's what I would suggest:\n\n1.  **Consider an Urgent Care Clinic (if available):** If you have an urgent care clinic with X-ray capabilities open on weekends in your area, this might be a good middle ground. You'll likely have a shorter wait time than an ED.\n2.  **Go to the ED If:**\n    *   Your pain is worsening despite home care.\n    *   You are unable to tolerate the pain.\n    *   You develop increasing swelling, bruising, or deformity.\n    *   You experience new or worsening numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers.\n    *   You are very worried about the possibility of a fracture.\n3.  **If You Decide to Wait Until Monday:**\n    *   Strictly follow the RICE protocol (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation).\n    *   Avoid using the injured wrist as much as possible.\n    *   Take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed (again, paracetamol/acetaminophen is usually preferred, but consult your doctor or pharmacist).\n    *   Be prepared to go to the doctor first thing Monday morning.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Tell the Doctor Everything:** Be sure to inform the doctor about your Graves' disease, carbimazole use, epilepsy, and levetiracetam.\n*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask the doctor about the possible diagnoses, the risks and benefits of treatment options, and the expected recovery time.\n*   **Get a Splint/Cast:** If a fracture is suspected but not immediately visible on X-ray, the doctor may recommend a thumb spica splint/cast and follow-up X-rays in 1-2 weeks (because scaphoid fractures can be difficult to see immediately after the injury).\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and address your concerns regarding your Lamictal XR, your seizures, and potential medication efficacy.\n\n**Regarding Lamictal Expiration and Effectiveness:**\n\n*   **General Guidelines:** Most medications retain their effectiveness up to their expiration date when stored properly. However, the efficacy *can* gradually decrease over time after that date. The manufacturer guarantees potency until the expiration date, not necessarily beyond.\n*   **Your Neurologist's Perspective:** Your neurologist's experience, observing that switching to newer bottles (even before the expiration date) seemed to improve your levels and symptoms, is crucial. It suggests that, *for you specifically*, there might be a sensitivity to even a slight decrease in potency as the medication ages.\n*   **Your Specific Situation:** The fact that you experienced a cluster of seizures in 2019 that coincided with lower-than-usual Lamictal levels, and then improved after switching to newer bottles, provides evidence suggesting that the medication might have been less potent.\n*   **Recommendation:** While the manufacturer states that it is good to the expiry date for you in your situation it might be causing a slight drop of level. Since this has happened before. I'd advise talking to your doctor but with your history he would probably say to throw those pills out.\n\n**Regarding Your Seizures and Stress:**\n\n*   **Stress as a Trigger:** Stress, sleep deprivation, and hormonal changes are well-known seizure triggers in people with epilepsy. It sounds like these factors likely contributed to your seizures in October 2020 and June 2021.\n*   **Importance of Lifestyle:** Managing stress, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and practicing good sleep hygiene are extremely important for seizure control.\n*   **Headaches as a Warning Sign?** The return of your morning headaches *could* be a sign that your Lamictal level is not optimal, or it could be related to stress, sleep, or other factors. It's important to investigate this.\n\n**Switching from 200mg to 300mg XR Tablets:**\n\n*   **XR Formulation:** The \"XR\" (extended-release) part is crucial. XR formulations release the medication gradually over time.\n*   **Bioequivalence:** If your doctor prescribed the 300mg XR tablets, they should be bioequivalent to the 200mg XR tablets (meaning the same amount of drug is absorbed at the same rate).  However, subtle differences in manufacturing *can* sometimes affect individual patients.\n*   **Potential for Differences:** While unlikely, it's *possible* that the different manufacturing of 300mg XR tablets *could* lead to slight changes in the drug release profile and absorption compared to the 200mg XR tablets.\n*   **Monitor Closely:** When you switch to the 300mg XR tablets, pay close attention to any changes in your seizure control, side effects (including the headaches), or overall well-being.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Neurologist Immediately:** Describe your symptoms and how they might relate to the older medications. Specifically mention you are concerned about using pills that are expiring in one year given what happened in the past. Ask for recommendations on how to deal with your headaches.\n\n2.  **Blood Level Check:** Discuss with your neurologist if a blood level check is warranted now, even if it is difficult to get one quickly. This will provide an objective measurement of your Lamictal level. Be sure to take your medication as prescribed until you speak to your doctor.\n\n3.  **Consider throwing the pills out:** Given your history and how sensitive you might be it might be best to throw those pills out that are expiring next year.\n\n4.  **Document and Monitor:** If you switch to the 300mg XR tablets, keep a detailed log of any changes in your headaches, seizure frequency, side effects, sleep patterns, stress levels, etc. This information will be very valuable to your neurologist.\n\n5.  **Lifestyle Modifications:** Prioritize stress management techniques (e.g., meditation, yoga, deep breathing), maintain a consistent sleep schedule, and create a relaxing bedtime routine. Consider couples counseling to help manage marital stress.\n\n6.  **Seizure Action Plan:** Discuss with your neurologist what to do if you experience a seizure, including when to call emergency services.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Always consult with your neurologist before making any changes to your medication regimen.**\n*   **Do not abruptly stop taking Lamictal, as this can increase the risk of seizures.**\n*   **Store your medication properly (away from heat and moisture).**  You're already doing this in your dresser.\n*   **Communicate openly with your neurologist about any concerns you have.**  Your doctor is your best resource for managing your epilepsy.\n\nI understand this can be frustrating. You are taking the right steps by being proactive and seeking information.\n"

    "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "You are right to be concerned and skeptical. The neurologist's explanation sounds highly improbable and dismissive, especially given the sequence of events: a seizure at the hospital before discharge followed by multiple seizures at home. While I'm not a medical professional, I can tell you why your concerns are valid and what alternative explanations should be considered.\n\n**Why the Neurologist's Explanation is Highly Unlikely:**\n\n*   **Timing:** The fact that the seizures started *after* discharge and days after birth makes the \"shakiness\" explanation incredibly weak. If maternal anxiety during labor caused it, the seizures would be expected much sooner and likely while still in the hospital.\n*   **Mechanism:** There is no credible medical mechanism for maternal shaking or anxiety to cause seizures in a baby days later. This explanation lacks scientific basis.\n*   **Dismissal:** A good neurologist would thoroughly investigate any new-onset seizures in a newborn, rather than offering a flimsy and unsubstantiated explanation. The fact that the neurologist provided this explanation without further investigation is concerning.\n\n**Possible (More Likely) Causes of Neonatal Seizures:**\n\nHere are some of the things that should have been tested or at least be taken into consideration:\n\n*   **Metabolic Imbalances:** Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), low calcium (hypocalcemia), or other electrolyte imbalances can cause seizures.\n*   **Infections:** Meningitis or other infections (even those acquired *in utero*) can trigger seizures.\n*   **Brain Injury:** Although you mentioned the brain scan was good, subtle brain injuries during delivery (even with a seemingly normal delivery) can sometimes cause seizures. These might not always be immediately apparent on initial scans.\n*   **Genetic Conditions:** Some rare genetic conditions can predispose newborns to seizures.\n*   **Drug Withdrawal:** While less likely given the details, if the mother was taking certain medications during pregnancy, the baby could be experiencing withdrawal.\n*   **Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE):** Even with a \"good\" pregnancy, subtle oxygen deprivation around the time of birth can sometimes occur, leading to brain injury and seizures. It can happen.\n*   **Pyridoxine Dependency:** This is a rare metabolic disorder that needs to be ruled out in babies with seizures.\n*   **Idiopathic:** Sometimes, despite thorough investigation, the cause of seizures remains unknown.\n\n**What Your Friend Should Do (Advocate for the Baby):**\n\n1.  **Get a Second Opinion:** This is crucial. Your friend should seek a second opinion from another *neonatal neurologist* at a different hospital or practice. Emphasize the multiple seizures, the timing, and their unease with the initial explanation.\n2.  **Demand Thorough Testing:** Ensure that all possible causes listed above (and anything else the second neurologist recommends) are thoroughly investigated. This includes blood tests, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to rule out infection, more advanced brain imaging (like an MRI, if appropriate), and genetic testing if indicated.\n3.  **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of all seizures (time, duration, appearance), all interactions with medical staff, test results, and any other relevant information.\n4.  **Be Assertive:** Your friend needs to be a strong advocate for her niece. Don't be afraid to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and insist on thorough investigations.\n5.  **Consider Legal Consultation:** While it's too early to jump to legal action, it's wise to consult with a medical malpractice attorney. If there *was* negligence that caused harm, early consultation can help protect their options.\n6.  **Trust Your Instincts:** Your friend and her family need to trust their gut feeling. If something doesn't feel right, they need to push for answers.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Early Intervention:** Early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal seizures are critical for minimizing potential long-term complications.\n*   **Continuous Monitoring:** The baby should be closely monitored for further seizures, ideally with EEG monitoring.\n\n**In summary, while seemingly healthy at birth, the sequence of events points to something more than maternal anxiety. The family needs to push for a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified team of specialists.**\n"

    "question": "So I'm an 18 yr old Caucasian male (62kg,180cm). Since some months ago, I have constant depersonalization/dereaalization and periods of confusion that really bother me. I went to a neurologist and had an MRI scan(which turned out fine, except for some normal anatomical variants) and I was wondering if my confusion and dpdr can be the result of epilepsy ?(non-convulsive seizures). Thanks!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the situation and address your concerns about epilepsy, depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and confusion.  It's important to state upfront that I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. You *must* discuss these concerns with your doctor for definitive answers and personalized medical advice.\n\nHere's a reasoned approach to your question, considering the information you've provided:\n\n**1. Understanding Depersonalization/Derealization (DPDR) and Confusion:**\n\n*   **Depersonalization:** Feeling detached from your own body, thoughts, feelings, or actions.  Like you're observing yourself from the outside.\n*   **Derealization:** Feeling detached from your surroundings. Things may seem unreal, distorted, or dreamlike.\n*   **Confusion:** Difficulty thinking clearly, remembering things, or understanding your surroundings.\n\n**2. Epilepsy and Non-Convulsive Seizures (Absence Seizures or Complex Partial Seizures):**\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** A neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.\n*   **Non-Convulsive Seizures (Absence and Complex Partial):** These seizures don't involve the dramatic convulsions (jerking movements) that are often associated with epilepsy. They can manifest in other ways, including:\n    *   **Absence Seizures (Typical and Atypical):**  Brief periods of staring, unresponsiveness, and sometimes subtle movements (e.g., eye blinking, lip smacking).  The person is usually unaware of the seizure and quickly returns to normal afterward. Atypical absence seizures tend to be longer and may have more gradual onset and offset.\n    *   **Complex Partial Seizures:** Impaired awareness or consciousness, often accompanied by automatisms (repetitive, purposeless behaviors like lip smacking, picking at clothes, or wandering).  DPDR-like experiences and confusion can occur during or after the seizure.\n\n**3. The Link Between DPDR, Confusion, and Epilepsy (Potential, but Not Definitive):**\n\n*   **Possible:** Yes, it's *possible* that your DPDR and confusion could be related to non-convulsive seizures.  Certain types of seizures, particularly complex partial seizures originating in the temporal lobe, can manifest with these symptoms. These seizures can disrupt normal brain activity, leading to altered perceptions and cognitive difficulties.\n*   **However:** Many other conditions can cause DPDR and confusion. It is crucial to rule out these other possibilities before considering epilepsy.\n\n**4. Other Potential Causes of DPDR and Confusion (Besides Epilepsy):**\n\n*   **Mental Health Conditions:**\n    *   **Anxiety Disorders:** Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety can trigger DPDR.\n    *   **Depressive Disorders:** Depression can sometimes be accompanied by DPDR.\n    *   **Dissociative Disorders:** DPDR is a core symptom of dissociative disorders, such as depersonalization/derealization disorder, dissociative identity disorder (DID), and dissociative amnesia.\n    *   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Trauma can lead to DPDR as a coping mechanism.\n*   **Substance Use:**  Drug and alcohol use (including withdrawal) can cause DPDR and confusion.\n*   **Migraines:** Some types of migraines, especially those with aura, can cause neurological symptoms including confusion and altered perceptions.\n*   **Sleep Deprivation:** Chronic lack of sleep can contribute to DPDR and cognitive problems.\n*   **Medical Conditions (Less Likely, but Important to Consider):**\n    *   **Vitamin Deficiencies (e.g., B12):** Can affect neurological function.\n    *   **Thyroid Disorders:** Can cause cognitive and emotional changes.\n    *   **Autoimmune Diseases (e.g., Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis):** In rare cases, can affect the brain and cause neurological symptoms.\n*   **Stress:** High levels of stress can trigger DPDR.\n\n**5. The MRI Results:**\n\n*   **Normal MRI (with Anatomical Variants):**  A normal MRI is reassuring, but it doesn't completely rule out epilepsy.  Some types of epilepsy, particularly those with subtle or focal seizure activity, may not show abnormalities on a standard MRI.  \"Anatomical variants\" are normal differences in brain structure that are not related to any disease.\n\n**6. What You Should Do (Most Important Steps):**\n\n*   **Follow Up with Your Neurologist:**  Schedule a follow-up appointment with the neurologist who ordered the MRI. Discuss your ongoing symptoms, your concerns about epilepsy, and the other potential causes mentioned above.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  Ask your neurologist if an EEG is warranted. An EEG measures brainwave activity and can help detect abnormal electrical patterns that are characteristic of seizures.  It's important to note that a single EEG may not always capture seizure activity, especially if seizures are infrequent.  Sometimes, longer-term EEG monitoring (e.g., ambulatory EEG or video EEG) is needed.  A sleep-deprived EEG can also sometimes increase the likelihood of capturing abnormalities.\n*   **Neuropsychological Testing:** This type of testing can assess cognitive functions like memory, attention, and executive function. The results can provide valuable information about the nature and extent of any cognitive impairments.\n*   **Consider a Psychiatric Evaluation:**  If your neurologist rules out neurological causes (or after they have completed the necessary tests), consider seeking an evaluation from a psychiatrist or psychologist. They can assess for mental health conditions that might be contributing to your DPDR and confusion.\n*   **Keep a Symptom Diary:**  Record the frequency, duration, and intensity of your DPDR and confusion episodes. Note any triggers or associated symptoms (e.g., anxiety, stress, fatigue, sleep disturbances). This information can be helpful for your doctor.\n*   **Be Patient:**  Finding the cause of DPDR and confusion can sometimes be a process of elimination. It may take time and multiple tests to reach a diagnosis.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhile epilepsy (specifically non-convulsive seizures) is a *possible* cause of your DPDR and confusion, it is not the *only* possible cause.  A thorough medical and psychological evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.  It is good that you have already had an MRI, and you need to discuss further testing (like an EEG) with your neurologist. It is also important to explore mental health and other medical causes with appropriate medical professionals. Do not self-diagnose or self-treat.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find answers and relief soon.  Remember to consult with your doctor for any medical advice.\n"

    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex case with a constellation of symptoms that points to a systemic issue. Given the information provided, here's a breakdown of potential considerations, keeping in mind that **I am not a medical professional, and this is not a diagnosis. This information is for educational purposes only and requires evaluation by a qualified physician.**\n\n**Key Considerations & Potential Diagnostic Paths:**\n\n*   **Autoimmune Disease:** This remains a high suspicion, despite initial negative lupus workup.\n    *   **Why Lupus is Still a Consideration:** Lupus can be seronegative (negative ANA or other antibodies). The fluctuating GFR, Raynaud's, anemia, positive ANA (even at 1:320), seizures, and potential small blood clots all align with potential lupus manifestations.  The fact that C3 and C4 were normal initially doesn't rule it out, as these can fluctuate.\n        *   **Next Steps:**  A more comprehensive lupus workup is *essential*. This should include:\n            *   **Repeat ANA with reflex to specific antibodies:**  Specifically, anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, anti-phospholipid antibodies (including lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I).  Consider testing for atypical ANAs as well.\n            *   **Complement levels (C3, C4, CH50):** Should be checked during flares or when other symptoms are prominent.\n            *   **Kidney Biopsy:** If the fluctuating GFR continues and other causes are ruled out, a kidney biopsy may be necessary to assess for lupus nephritis or other renal pathology.\n    *   **Other Autoimmune Possibilities:** If lupus remains unlikely, consider:\n        *   **Vasculitis:**  The blood clots, bruising, Raynaud's, neuropathy, and kidney involvement could suggest vasculitis.  This requires a thorough workup including:\n            *   **ANCA testing (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies):**  To look for specific vasculitides like granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).\n            *   **Complement levels.**\n            *   **Cryoglobulins:** Especially with Raynaud's and potential kidney involvement.\n            *   **Imaging (angiography or CT angiography):**  To assess for vessel inflammation.\n            *   **Biopsy of affected tissue (skin, kidney, nerve):**  If vasculitis is suspected, a biopsy is often needed for definitive diagnosis.\n        *   **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):**  Given the history of post-partum hemorrhage, blood clots, and potential Raynaud's, APS should be thoroughly investigated, even if initial testing was negative.  It can be seronegative, and testing should be repeated at least 12 weeks apart.\n        *   **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):** This can present with overlapping features of lupus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Anti-RNP antibody testing is important.\n\n*   **Mitochondrial Disorder:** The fluctuating symptoms, seizures, fatigue, GI issues, and potential neuropathy could align with a mitochondrial disorder.\n    *   **Next Steps:**\n        *   **Lactate and pyruvate levels:**  Elevated levels, especially after exercise, can be suggestive.\n        *   **Creatine kinase (CK) levels:**  May be elevated.\n        *   **Genetic testing:**  To identify specific mitochondrial mutations.\n        *   **Muscle biopsy:**  Can be helpful in diagnosing certain mitochondrial disorders.\n\n*   **Porphyria:** Though less likely, some forms of porphyria can cause neurological symptoms, abdominal pain, and psychiatric disturbances.\n    *   **Next Steps:**\n        *   **Urine porphyrins:**  To screen for porphyria.\n        *   **Plasma porphyrins:**  If urine porphyrins are abnormal.\n\n*   **Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):** Given the history of TBI, seizures, and potential stroke-like symptoms, CAA could be considered, especially with the presence of bruising and potential blood clots.\n    * **Next Steps:**\n        *   **MRI of the brain with specific sequences:** To look for evidence of microhemorrhages or amyloid deposition in the brain.\n\n*   **Other Considerations:**\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:**  A thorough review of all medications and supplements is essential.\n    *   **Infections:**  Ruling out chronic infections is important.\n    *   **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Evaluate for vitamin deficiencies (B12, D, etc.) that could contribute to anemia, neuropathy, and fatigue.\n    *   **Paroxysmal disorders:** It is worth considering if all episodes of symptoms are seizures.\n\n**Addressing Specific Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Seizures:** Continue working closely with a neurologist to optimize seizure control.\n*   **Chronic Low Potassium (Hypokalemia):** The cause of the hypokalemia needs to be identified. Consider:\n    *   **Renal causes:**  Renal tubular acidosis (RTA).\n    *   **Gastrointestinal losses:**  Malabsorption.\n    *   **Medications:**  Diuretics.\n*   **Anemia and High MCH:** Investigate the type of anemia. Is it iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, or another cause? High MCH suggests macrocytic anemia, pointing towards B12 or folate deficiency, or less commonly, liver disease or thyroid issues.\n*   **Fluctuating GFR:** Requires close monitoring by a nephrologist. Repeat urine analysis with protein creatinine ratio is important.\n*   **Low Glucose Issues:** Further investigation is needed. Consider:\n    *   **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM):** To capture hypoglycemic episodes.\n    *   **Mixed meal tolerance test:** To assess insulin response and rule out reactive hypoglycemia.\n*   **Raynaud's:** Management includes avoiding cold exposure and potentially medications to improve circulation.\n*   **Tachycardia/PVCs:**  Requires evaluation by a cardiologist. Consider a Holter monitor to assess the frequency and type of arrhythmias.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach Summary:**\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Autoimmune Workup:** Repeat and expand testing for lupus, APS, vasculitis, and other connective tissue diseases.\n2.  **Renal Evaluation:**  Nephrology consultation is crucial to investigate the fluctuating GFR and potential kidney involvement.\n3.  **Neurological Evaluation:** Continue to monitor seizures, consider repeat MRI if symptoms change, and evaluate for CAA.\n4.  **Metabolic/Mitochondrial Evaluation:**  Consider testing for mitochondrial disorders.\n5.  **Hypokalemia Investigation:** Determine the underlying cause of chronic low potassium.\n6.  **Anemia/MCH Investigation:** Identify the type and cause of the anemia.\n7.  **Cardiology Evaluation:** Address the tachycardia and PVCs.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Timeline:**  Documenting the onset and progression of each symptom is critical.\n*   **Triggers:**  Identifying any triggers for symptom flares is helpful.\n*   **Family History:**  Gather more detailed family history of autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, and other relevant conditions.\n\nIt is imperative that this individual be evaluated by a team of specialists, including a rheumatologist, nephrologist, neurologist, and potentially a hematologist and geneticist, to determine the underlying cause of these complex symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n"

    "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable you're concerned and looking for ways to help your mum. It sounds like you're already taking positive steps, but here's a more structured approach to consider, along with potential avenues to explore:\n\n**1. Review Medications and Recent Changes:**\n\n*   **Medication Adherence:**  This is *crucial*.  Did your mum consistently take her medication as prescribed while in India? Differences in brands (generic vs. brand name) can also sometimes lead to changes in effectiveness, although this is less common.\n*   **Drug Interactions:** Were any new medications (prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal) started in India?  Some medications can interact with Keppra and Trileptal, affecting their blood levels and effectiveness. Even seemingly innocuous remedies can have unexpected consequences.\n*   **Dosage and Blood Levels:** Have your mum's blood levels of Keppra and Trileptal been checked recently?  Even if she's been on the same dose for years, changes in body weight, kidney function, or other medications can alter the levels in her system.\n*   **Generics:** Be sure the current prescription are for the brand name or the same generic she has been taking previously. There are many different brands of Keppra and Trileptal and they may not contain the same excipients and/or be manufactured differently which can affect the release of the medication.\n*   **Consider a Medication Review:**  Schedule an appointment with her doctor (ideally, the neurologist) to review *all* her medications, including those for high blood pressure and cholesterol. A pharmacist can also do a medication review to identify potential interactions.\n\n**2. Neurological Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Re-evaluation by Neurologist:** A thorough re-evaluation by her neurologist is essential.  This should include:\n    *   **Detailed Seizure History:** The neurologist needs a very detailed account of the seizures \u2013 frequency, duration, triggers, and any changes in the type of seizure activity since her last evaluation. Specifically, a description of what she did during the absent seizure.\n    *   **EEG:** A new EEG is critical.  Ideally, a prolonged EEG (even ambulatory) to try and capture seizure activity during an event. The EEG can help determine the seizure type and location in the brain.\n    *   **Neuroimaging:** Consider if another MRI of the brain is necessary, especially if there has been a significant change in seizure frequency or type. This is to rule out any structural changes.\n*   **Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the current neurologist's approach, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist, especially one with expertise in epilepsy.  Look for an epileptologist \u2013 a neurologist with specialized training in epilepsy.\n\n**3. Differential Diagnosis (What Else Could It Be?)**\n\n*   **Pseudo-seizures (Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures - PNES):** It's wise that the doctor is considering a psychological component. PNES can mimic epileptic seizures but are caused by psychological distress, not abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The lip smacking and chewing is highly suggestive of PNES. Sometimes, people can have both epileptic seizures *and* PNES.\n*   **Other Medical Conditions:** Sometimes other medical conditions can mimic or trigger seizures.  These need to be ruled out:\n    *   **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Check blood levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.\n    *   **Vitamin Deficiencies:**  Certain vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12, D) can affect neurological function.\n    *   **Thyroid Problems:**  Thyroid disorders can sometimes contribute to seizures.\n    *   **Sleep Apnea:**  Disrupted sleep can worsen seizure control. Consider a sleep study if there are any signs of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime sleepiness).\n*   **Migraines:** Certain types of migraines, especially those with aura, can sometimes present with similar symptoms to absent seizures (confusion, altered awareness).\n\n**4. Addressing Psychological and Social Factors:**\n\n*   **Psychologist/Psychiatrist:**  Seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist experienced in working with epilepsy patients is an excellent step. They can help identify and address any underlying anxiety, depression, trauma, or other psychological factors that may be contributing to the seizures.\n*   **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy):**  CBT is a type of therapy that can help people manage stress, anxiety, and other psychological issues. It can also help individuals develop coping mechanisms for dealing with seizures and their impact on their lives.\n*   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, and other relaxation techniques can help reduce stress and anxiety, potentially improving seizure control.\n*   **Social Support:** Addressing your mum's feelings of isolation is crucial. Encourage her to:\n    *   **Connect with the Indian community in Australia.**\n    *   **Join epilepsy support groups (online or in person).** Sharing experiences with others who understand can be incredibly helpful. Epilepsy Action Australia might be a good place to start.\n    *   **Engage in hobbies and activities she enjoys.**\n    *   **Maintain contact with family and friends in India through video calls and other means.**\n\n**5. Safety Measures:**\n\n*   **Seizure Action Plan:**  Develop a written seizure action plan with her doctor and share it with family members, caregivers, and close friends. This plan should outline what to do during a seizure, when to call emergency services, and any specific instructions for her care.\n*   **Home Safety:**\n    *   **Assess the home for potential hazards:**  Remove sharp objects, pad sharp corners, and install grab bars in the bathroom.\n    *   **Consider a medical alert bracelet or necklace** that identifies her epilepsy and provides emergency contact information.\n*   **Driving:**  Driving restrictions will likely be in place given the increased seizure frequency.  Be sure to discuss this with her neurologist and understand the legal requirements in Australia.\n\n**6. Lifestyle Modifications:**\n\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Ensure she gets adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night) and maintains a regular sleep schedule.\n*   **Stress Management:**  Help her identify and manage stressors in her life.  Encourage her to practice relaxation techniques or engage in activities that help her de-stress.\n*   **Diet:**  While there's no specific \"epilepsy diet\" for everyone, a healthy, balanced diet is important.  Some people with epilepsy find that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, very low-carbohydrate) helps to reduce seizures, but this should only be considered under the guidance of a doctor and dietitian.\n*   **Avoid Alcohol and Illicit Drugs:** While your mum doesn't drink, it's worth mentioning that alcohol and illicit drugs can trigger seizures and interfere with epilepsy medications.\n*   **Regular Exercise:**  Regular physical activity can improve overall health and well-being, which may indirectly benefit seizure control.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate:**  You play a critical role as your mum's advocate. Attend medical appointments with her, take notes, ask questions, and ensure her concerns are addressed.\n*   **Patience:**  Finding the right combination of treatments and lifestyle modifications to control seizures can take time and effort. Be patient and supportive throughout the process.\n*   **Emergency Preparedness:**  Always have a plan in place in case of a prolonged or severe seizure. Know when to call emergency services and how to administer rescue medication (if prescribed).\n*   **Documentation:** Keep a detailed seizure diary. Document the date, time, duration, and characteristics of each seizure, as well as any potential triggers or contributing factors. This information can be invaluable to her doctor.\n\nThis is a multifaceted problem, and addressing it requires a comprehensive approach. Don't hesitate to seek help from multiple specialists and explore different treatment options. It may take time and effort, but with the right support and care, your mum can improve her quality of life. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing. Could that be something that is going on? I was just curious! This doesn\u2019t really negatively impact my life, it just causes me to get some weird looks sometimes.Details: 23F, 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs, Caucasian, acid cravings, existing medical issues (Migraines, IST, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation), medications (verapamil and singulair), no drugs, sparingly drink, no smoking.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's definitely interesting that you've had these intense vinegar and acidic cravings since childhood! While it's impossible to diagnose anything online, and it's important to consult with your doctor, let's explore some possibilities based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Potential Biological/Nutritional Factors:**\n\n*   **Iron Deficiency:** This is often the first thing that comes to mind with unusual cravings (pica). Although you eat a varied diet, iron absorption can be affected by various factors. Vinegar can sometimes *enhance* iron absorption, which might explain why you crave it. While you're not craving non-food items, it's still worth exploring, especially if you haven't had your iron levels checked recently.\n\n*   **Gut Microbiome Imbalance:** Emerging research suggests that gut bacteria can influence cravings. Certain bacteria thrive in acidic environments. A specific imbalance could potentially drive cravings for vinegar and other acidic foods. This is a complex area, and more research is needed, but it's a possibility.\n\n*   **Calcium Deficiency:** Although less directly related to vinegar, low calcium can sometimes manifest in unusual cravings. The connection here is weaker, but it's still something to consider as part of a broader nutritional assessment.\n\n*   **Digestive Issues:** Acidity can sometimes play a role in digestive processes. Your body *might* be craving vinegar in an attempt to regulate stomach acid, especially if you have occasional indigestion or reflux (even mild). However, this is more speculative and requires a medical evaluation.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n*   **Learned Behavior/Habit:** Since these cravings started in childhood, there's a component of learned behavior or habit formation. You might have unconsciously associated the taste and sensation of vinegar with comfort or satisfaction.\n\n*   **Sensory Seeking:** Some people are highly sensitive to certain tastes and textures and actively seek them out for sensory stimulation. The strong, sharp taste of vinegar could be appealing in this way.\n\n*   **Stress/Emotional Connection:** While you haven't identified stress as a direct trigger, emotional factors can sometimes be linked to cravings. Pay attention to your emotional state in the days leading up to and during these cravings.\n\n*   **Dehydration:** Although vinegar cravings are not commonly associated with dehydration, sometimes a desire for something sharp and intense can be a misguided attempt to quench thirst or replace electrolytes.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Doctor:** This is the most important step. Describe your cravings in detail, including the frequency, intensity, and specific types of acidic foods you crave. Mention your low white blood cell count and current medications. Ask for a comprehensive blood panel, including:\n    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential (to assess white blood cells in more detail)\n    *   Iron studies (serum iron, ferritin, TIBC, transferrin saturation)\n    *   Vitamin D levels\n    *   Electrolytes\n    *   Calcium levels\n    *   Possibly a comprehensive metabolic panel\n\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Food/Craving Journal:** For a few weeks, meticulously track everything you eat and drink, including the timing and intensity of your cravings. Note any potential triggers (stress, sleep patterns, menstrual cycle, etc.).\n\n3.  **Experiment with Alternatives (With Caution):** If you suspect a nutritional deficiency, *discuss this with your doctor* before starting any supplements. Do not excessively consume potentially harmful substances like vinegar without medical guidance.\n\n4.  **Mindfulness:** When a craving hits, try to pause and observe it without judgment. Ask yourself: What am I feeling? Is there an emotional component? Am I truly hungry? Can I satisfy the craving with a healthier alternative (e.g., a small amount of fermented food like sauerkraut or kimchi)?\n\n5.  **Gut Health:**  Consider discussing your cravings with a registered dietician. While more research is needed, addressing gut health through diet (probiotic-rich foods) might be worth exploring under professional guidance.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Vinegar Consumption:**\n\n*   **Tooth Enamel Erosion:** Vinegar is highly acidic and can erode tooth enamel over time, leading to sensitivity and cavities. Rinse your mouth with water after consuming vinegar.\n*   **Esophageal Irritation:** Excessive vinegar consumption can irritate the esophagus, especially if you have reflux or other digestive issues.\n*   **Potassium Levels:** Vinegar can potentially affect potassium levels in some individuals, especially those taking certain medications. This is why bloodwork is so important.\n\nIn conclusion, your vinegar cravings are unusual and warrant further investigation. The most important step is to consult with your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions or nutritional deficiencies. Keeping a detailed journal and being mindful of potential triggers can also be helpful. Do not self-treat or excessively consume vinegar without medical guidance. Good luck!\n"

    "question": " I\u2019m 19F about 5\u20193\u201d not sure about my weight but quite small from the UK.So, in the past, I\u2019ve had what I believe to be 3 tonic-clonic seizures. I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don\u2019t feel quite normal at the moment and I\u2019m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it\u2019s my first ever post on Reddit and I\u2019m just very confused about what\u2019s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",

    "answer": "Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really unsettling and confusing time. It's completely understandable that you're reaching out for advice. Here's a breakdown of what you've described and some suggestions on what you could do:\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms**\n\n*   **Possible Tonic-Clonic Seizures:** While you suspect these were seizures, it's important to remember that without a medical evaluation, it's difficult to be certain. The circumstances (weed use, nose piercing) could have contributed, but they don't automatically rule out other possibilities.\n*   **Focal Seizure (Possible):** The recent episode with sudden panic, dizziness, feeling disconnected, etc., could potentially be a focal seizure. Focal seizures can manifest in various ways, including emotional changes, sensory disturbances, and altered awareness.\n*   **Post-Event Behavior:** Your continued feeling of being \"not normal,\" staring, rocking, and generally feeling off could be a postictal state. This is the period after a seizure when the brain is recovering, and symptoms can vary significantly.\n*   **Mental Health:** You have a history of depression and anxiety, and occasional worries about schizophrenia. Anxiety, in particular, can cause symptoms that mimic some aspects of seizures (e.g., panic, dizziness, feeling disconnected). However, it's important to differentiate between mental health symptoms and potential seizure activity.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Medical Evaluation is Crucial:** Given your history and the recent episode, **you absolutely need to see a doctor.** This is the most important piece of advice I can give. Self-diagnosing is never a good idea, and accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for your well-being.\n*   **Seizure Triggers:** Weed use can lower the seizure threshold in some people, meaning it can make them more susceptible to seizures. The nose piercing itself might have triggered a vasovagal response (fainting), but it's less likely to directly cause a seizure unless there were complications.\n*   **Mental Health and Seizures:** There is a complex relationship between mental health and seizures. Anxiety and depression can sometimes be comorbid (co-occurring) with epilepsy, and certain seizure types can even have psychiatric manifestations. A thorough evaluation is needed to tease apart these factors.\n*   **Don't Minimize Symptoms:** It's easy to dismiss symptoms, especially when you're worried about what others might think or find out. However, your health is paramount, and being honest with a doctor is critical.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Doctor's Appointment:** Make an appointment with your GP (General Practitioner) as soon as possible. Be honest and upfront about your history, including the possible seizures, weed use, and your mental health concerns.\n2.  **Describe Your Symptoms in Detail:** When you see the doctor, provide a clear and detailed description of all your symptoms, including:\n    *   What you experience before, during, and after the episodes.\n    *   The duration of each symptom.\n    *   Any triggers or patterns you've noticed.\n    *   Any medications or substances you're using (including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and recreational drugs).\n3.  **Diagnostic Tests:** Your doctor may recommend various diagnostic tests, such as:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To measure brain activity and look for seizure patterns.\n    *   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of the Brain:** To rule out any structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for underlying medical conditions.\n4.  **Mental Health Evaluation:** If mental health issues are suspected to be contributing to your symptoms, your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist for further evaluation and treatment.\n5.  **Consider a Support System:** Having a support system can be incredibly helpful. Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about what you're going through.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns About Parents and the Past**\n\n*   **Confidentiality:** Remember that doctors are bound by patient confidentiality. They cannot disclose your medical information to your parents (or anyone else) without your explicit consent unless there are specific legal exceptions (e.g., if you are an immediate danger to yourself or others).\n*   **Focus on Your Health:** Your health and well-being are the most important thing. Try to shift your focus away from worrying about what your parents might think and prioritize getting the medical attention you need.\n*   **If You Choose to Tell Them:** If you decide to tell your parents, consider practicing what you want to say beforehand. Frame it as a health concern and emphasize that you need their support in getting medical help. You could start by saying something like, \"I need to talk to you about something important related to my health. I've been having some concerning symptoms, and I need to see a doctor.\"\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\n*   I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "Age 33 Sex M Height 5\u2019 9\u201d Weight 170 Race Caucasian Duration of complaint 3 Weeks Location Distal Tibia/Ankle Any existing relevant medical issues Epilepsy Current medications KeppraI\u2019m about 3 weeks post skateboarding injury and I have this lump on my distal tibia. Seems like it\u2019s off the bone on the medial side. As a skateboarder it\u2019s common to take repetitive shots to the ankle, so I\u2019m not overly concerned. The lump happened to appear after the injury. It wasn\u2019t super painful so I kept on skating after a few more incidents to the same area I decided to take a break. I\u2019m about a week removed from skating and haven\u2019t seen a noticeable improvement. No pain. Just sensitive to the touch. Thanks in advance",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thanks for providing that detailed information. Based on your description, here's a breakdown of what might be going on and what steps you should consider:\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\n*   **Hematoma:** A collection of blood outside of blood vessels, often caused by trauma. This is a likely possibility given the injury and the appearance of the lump after the injury. They can be sensitive to the touch, and sometimes take weeks to fully resolve.\n*   **Bursitis:** Inflammation of a bursa (a fluid-filled sac that cushions joints). Repetitive impact or pressure, common in skateboarding, can irritate the bursa around the ankle.\n*   **Periostitis:** Inflammation of the periosteum (the membrane covering the bone). Again, trauma can cause this.\n*   **Soft Tissue Injury (Muscle/Ligament):** A strain or sprain can cause swelling and a palpable lump, especially if there's some associated bleeding.\n*   **Ganglion Cyst:** Although less likely in this specific scenario, ganglion cysts can sometimes occur near the ankle. They are typically filled with synovial fluid.\n*   **Bone Spur/Exostosis:** While these usually develop over longer periods, repeated trauma *could* theoretically contribute to their development. However, this is less likely to appear so quickly.\n*   **Less Likely, But Still to Consider:** While less likely given your history, rule out more concerning causes, such as a soft tissue tumor or bone tumor (benign or malignant).\n\n**Why It's Important to Get it Checked Out:**\n\nEven though you're not experiencing significant pain, and it's likely something benign, a persistent lump that hasn't improved after a week of rest *does* warrant medical evaluation. Here's why:\n\n*   **To Rule Out Anything Serious:** It's crucial to exclude less common but more serious possibilities like bone spurs, ganglion cysts, tumors, or infections.\n*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Getting the correct diagnosis allows for appropriate management and prevents potential complications.\n*   **Preventing Chronic Issues:** Addressing the problem now can prevent it from becoming a chronic issue that limits your skateboarding in the future.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Doctor:** *The best course of action is to schedule an appointment with a doctor.* Ideally, see a sports medicine doctor or an orthopedic surgeon. They can examine your ankle, assess the lump, and determine the underlying cause. Describe the incident, the location, and the lack of improvement.\n2.  **Imaging:** The doctor will likely order imaging studies. X-rays are often the first step to evaluate the bone structure and rule out fractures or bone spurs. An MRI might be needed to visualize soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles, bursae) and to further characterize the lump.\n3.  **Continue Rest:** Continue to avoid skateboarding or activities that aggravate the area.\n4.  **R.I.C.E. (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation):** Continue to apply ice packs (wrapped in a towel) to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Compression with an elastic bandage can help reduce swelling. Elevate your leg whenever possible.\n5.  **Over-the-Counter Pain Relief:** If you have mild discomfort, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve), following the recommended dosage. *However, check with your doctor or pharmacist to ensure these are safe to take with your epilepsy medication (Keppra).* Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an alternative but doesn't have anti-inflammatory properties.\n6.  **Carefully follow the medication instructions and speak to your physician if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\n**What to Expect at the Doctor's Appointment:**\n\n*   **Physical Examination:** The doctor will examine your ankle, palpate the lump, assess your range of motion, and test for any instability.\n*   **History:** The doctor will ask detailed questions about the injury, your symptoms, and your medical history (including your epilepsy and Keppra use).\n*   **Discussion of Imaging:** The doctor will explain the results of any imaging studies and discuss treatment options.\n\n**Important Considerations with Keppra:**\n\n*   Always inform your doctor about all the medications you're taking, including Keppra. Some medications can interact with Keppra, so it's important to ensure that any treatment plan is safe and doesn't affect your seizure control.\n*   Do not stop or change your Keppra dosage without consulting your neurologist or epilepsy specialist.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.\n"

    "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand your deep concern for your relative. This sounds like a very frustrating and frightening situation, with the uncertainty and lack of a clear diagnosis significantly impacting her life. It's good that you're seeking information and exploring potential avenues.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential steps and considerations, given the information you've provided:\n\n**1. Revisit Epilepsy Diagnosis & Treatment:**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Epilepsy Evaluation:** While she's been diagnosed with epilepsy, it's crucial to ensure the diagnosis is absolutely certain and that the type of epilepsy is properly identified. Consider seeking a consultation with an *epileptologist*, a neurologist specializing in epilepsy. They can re-evaluate the EEG results, clinical presentation, and medication response.  This is especially important considering the inconsistent response to medication and the unusual fainting patterns.\n*   **EEG Monitoring:**\n    *   **Ambulatory EEG:** If routine EEGs are not capturing events, ask about *ambulatory EEG monitoring*. This allows for continuous EEG recording over 24-72 hours, increasing the chance of capturing an event during a period when she is more likely to have a syncopal episode.\n    *   **Video EEG Monitoring:**  This involves video recording alongside EEG, which is crucial to correlate EEG changes with her clinical symptoms.  This is often done in a hospital setting.\n*   **Medication Review:**  The current medication regimen needs to be carefully reviewed.\n    *   **Dosage adjustments:**  Are the dosages of her anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) optimal based on her weight and other factors?\n    *   **Drug interactions:**  Could there be interactions with other medications (including over-the-counter) or supplements that might be affecting AED effectiveness or causing side effects that mimic other conditions?\n    *   **Side effects:** Some AEDs have side effects that may contribute to dizziness, fatigue, or cognitive problems, exacerbating her symptoms.\n    *   **Adherence:**  Is she consistently taking the medication as prescribed?\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:**  Even with an epilepsy diagnosis, other causes for the fainting spells need to be explored.  It's possible she has *both* epilepsy and another condition.\n\n**2. Consider Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES):**\n\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) / Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** It's important to consider that some events that look like seizures are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, but rather are a manifestation of psychological distress or underlying functional neurological disorder. This is a complex area, but often involves a disconnect between the brain and body, leading to physical symptoms that are not explained by structural damage or disease.\n    *   **Video EEG Monitoring:** PNES are typically diagnosed during video EEG monitoring when clinical events can be distinguished as non-epileptic.\n    *   **Referral to a Neuropsychiatrist/Psychiatrist with experience in FND:** If PNES are suspected, referral to a psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist experienced in diagnosing and treating FND is crucial.  Treatment often involves therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) and potentially medication management.\n*   **Physiological NES:**  These are non-epileptic events caused by a physical condition *other* than epilepsy, such as orthostatic hypotension (see below).\n\n**3. Explore Cardiac Causes of Fainting (Syncope):**\n\n*   **Cardiologist Referral:**  A thorough cardiac evaluation is *essential* to rule out heart-related causes of fainting. This should include:\n    *   **EKG (Electrocardiogram):** To detect heart rhythm abnormalities.\n    *   **Echocardiogram:** An ultrasound of the heart to assess its structure and function.\n    *   **Holter Monitor or Event Recorder:**  If EKGs are normal, longer-term monitoring (24 hours to several weeks) might be needed to capture intermittent arrhythmias.\n    *   **Tilt Table Test:**  This test helps to evaluate if changes in body position trigger fainting due to blood pressure or heart rate irregularities (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope).\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope:**  This is a common cause of fainting triggered by stress, pain, or prolonged standing.  It involves a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure.\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  A drop in blood pressure upon standing.  Can be caused by dehydration, medications, or underlying medical conditions.  Simple measures like increasing fluid intake and wearing compression stockings can sometimes help.\n\n**4. Investigate Hormonal Influence:**\n\n*   **Menstrual Cycle Correlation:** The patient's observation of fainting episodes around her period is very important.\n    *   **Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Keep a detailed diary of her symptoms, including the timing of fainting spells, any preceding symptoms (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea), the specific day of her menstrual cycle, and any potential triggers (stress, fatigue, etc.).\n    *   **Hormone Testing:**  Discuss hormone level testing with her doctor, especially estrogen and progesterone.  Fluctuations in these hormones can influence seizure threshold in some women with epilepsy (catamenial epilepsy), and they can also contribute to other conditions causing fainting.\n    *   **Gynecological Consultation:** A gynecologist can evaluate for any underlying gynecological conditions that might be contributing to her symptoms.\n\n**5. Consider Other Neurological Conditions:**\n\n*   **Migraine with Aura:**  Some types of migraine can cause neurological symptoms, including temporary memory loss or confusion, that might resemble the \"autopilot\" episodes she described.\n*   **Transient Global Amnesia (TGA):**  This is a rare condition causing sudden, temporary memory loss.  It's usually benign, but needs to be ruled out.\n*   **Cerebrovascular Issues:** While less likely in a young person, it's important to rule out any abnormalities in blood vessels in the brain.  This is often done with an MRI or CT angiogram.\n\n**6. MS Re-Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Second Opinion from an MS Specialist:** Since the MS diagnosis was uncertain and withdrawn, it's worth getting a second opinion from a neurologist who specializes in multiple sclerosis.  They can review the previous MRIs and clinical findings to determine if MS is still a possibility.\n*   **Further MS Testing:** If MS is still suspected, additional tests might be needed, such as:\n    *   **Spinal Tap (Lumbar Puncture):**  To analyze cerebrospinal fluid for signs of MS.\n    *   **Repeat MRI with Gadolinium:**  Gadolinium is a contrast dye that can highlight areas of active inflammation in the brain and spinal cord.\n\n**7. Key Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Detailed Medical History:** Be prepared to provide a comprehensive medical history, including all medications, supplements, past medical conditions, family history of seizures or fainting, and lifestyle factors (sleep, stress, diet).\n*   **Video Recordings:** If possible, try to record her fainting episodes or \"autopilot\" moments on video. This can be invaluable for doctors to see exactly what is happening.\n*   **Advocate for Your Relative:**  Be an active advocate for her, asking questions, expressing concerns, and ensuring that her voice is heard by the medical team.\n*   **Seek Mental Health Support:**  Living with chronic, undiagnosed symptoms can take a significant toll on mental health. Encourage your relative to seek counseling or therapy to cope with the stress, anxiety, and frustration she is experiencing.\n*   **Safety Precautions:**  While waiting for a diagnosis, prioritize her safety:\n    *   **Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery.**\n    *   **Take precautions to prevent falls (e.g., remove tripping hazards, use assistive devices).**\n    *   **Consider wearing a medical alert bracelet.**\n    *   **Inform close friends and family about her condition and how to help if she has an episode.**\n*   **Genetic Testing:** If other testing is inconclusive, genetic testing may be helpful to identify rare genetic causes of epilepsy or other neurological conditions.\n\n**Where to seek help:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Center:** Look for a Level 4 Epilepsy Center. These centers have the expertise and resources to diagnose and manage complex epilepsy cases.\n*   **Major University Hospital:** University hospitals often have specialized neurology and cardiology departments with experts in diagnosing and treating rare or unusual conditions.\n*   **National Organizations:** The Epilepsy Foundation and the National MS Society can provide information, support, and resources.\n\nThe process of diagnosis can be lengthy and complex. The key is to be persistent, advocate for your relative, and work closely with a team of experienced healthcare professionals. The more information you can gather and provide, the better equipped the doctors will be to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan.  Good luck!\n"

    "question": "25F white JME keppra 1gMy epilepsy seems very well controlled with keppra. No complaints.Lately I've been feeling really tired, but I'm getting good sleep. I don't have any signs of seizures when I wake up. It's always been hard to wake up in the mornings, but lately it's been awful. It feels like I didn't sleep at all.I was working today. I closed my eyes to blink, and everything was kinda dizzy, but it went away quick. It's hard to describe, it's kinda like dizziness, but also like everything's... dropping? Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the new symptoms you're experiencing, especially given your history of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and being on Keppra for several years. Here's a breakdown of possible explanations and what you should do:\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n*   **Keppra and Fatigue:** While Keppra is generally well-tolerated, fatigue is a known side effect. It's possible the fatigue is becoming more pronounced after several years, even if you haven't experienced it significantly before. Sometimes, side effects can fluctuate in intensity.\n\n*   **Keppra \"Wearing Off\" (Reduced Efficacy):** While not technically \"wearing off\" in the sense of becoming resistant, it is possible that your epilepsy is changing over time or that other factors are influencing your seizure threshold. This is less common with JME, but it's something to consider.\n\n*   **Breakthrough Seizures/Subclinical Seizures:** The \"dizzy, dropping/melting\" sensation you describe *could* potentially be a form of subtle seizure activity, even if it's not a full-blown myoclonic jerk. These are sometimes called \"auras\" or \"focal aware seizures.\" Because JME includes absences, this is a real concern.\n\n*   **Sleep Issues:** Even if you *think* you're getting good sleep, there could be an underlying sleep disorder affecting the quality of your rest. Examples include:\n\n    *   *Sleep Apnea:* This can disrupt sleep and cause daytime fatigue.\n    *   *Restless Legs Syndrome:* This can cause discomfort and difficulty staying asleep.\n    *   *Insomnia:* Even if you fall asleep, you may not be staying asleep.\n    *   *Circadian Rhythm Disorders:* If your sleep schedule is inconsistent, this can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n*   **Other Medical Conditions:** Fatigue and dizziness can be symptoms of many other underlying medical conditions, such as:\n\n    *   *Anemia (Iron Deficiency):* Very common in women.\n    *   *Thyroid Problems (Hypothyroidism):* Can cause fatigue, weight gain, and other symptoms.\n    *   *Vitamin Deficiencies (e.g., Vitamin D, B12):*\n    *   *Mental Health Conditions (Depression, Anxiety):* These can significantly impact sleep and energy levels.\n    *   *Migraines:* Some migraine variants can cause dizziness without headache.\n    *   *Low Blood Pressure:* Especially if the dizziness occurs when you stand up.\n\n*   **Lifestyle Factors:**\n\n    *   *Stress:* High stress levels can affect sleep and energy.\n    *   *Diet:* Poor nutrition can contribute to fatigue.\n    *   *Dehydration:* Can cause dizziness and fatigue.\n    *   *Lack of Exercise:*\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Neurologist IMMEDIATELY:** This is the most important step. Describe *all* of your symptoms \u2013 the fatigue, the dizziness/dropping sensation, and how they relate to your Keppra use. Don't try to \"shake it off.\" They need to know about these changes.\n2.  **Be Prepared for Questions:** Your neurologist will likely ask questions such as:\n    *   When did these symptoms start?\n    *   How often are you experiencing the dizziness/dropping sensation?\n    *   What makes the symptoms better or worse?\n    *   Are you taking any other medications or supplements?\n    *   Have there been any changes in your life (stress, diet, sleep schedule)?\n3.  **Possible Tests:** Your neurologist may order tests such as:\n    *   *EEG (Electroencephalogram):* To look for any seizure activity.\n    *   *Blood Tests:* To check Keppra levels, thyroid function, iron levels, vitamin levels, and other general health markers.\n    *   *Sleep Study (Polysomnography):* If a sleep disorder is suspected.\n4.  **Do NOT Change Your Keppra Dose Without Talking to Your Doctor:** Abruptly changing your medication dose can be dangerous and could trigger seizures.\n5.  **Keep a Symptom Diary:** Track when you experience the dizziness/dropping sensation, how long it lasts, and any potential triggers. This information can be helpful for your neurologist.\n6.  **Review Medications and Supplements:** Make a list of *everything* you are taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. Some substances can interact with Keppra.\n7.  **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene:**\n    *   Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends.\n    *   Create a relaxing bedtime routine.\n    *   Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n    *   Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n    *   Get regular exercise, but not too close to bedtime.\n\n**Why This is Important:**\n\n*   **Seizure Control:** Any change in seizure symptoms needs to be evaluated to ensure your epilepsy is still well-controlled.\n*   **Safety:** Dizziness can increase the risk of falls or accidents.\n*   **Quality of Life:** Fatigue can significantly impact your daily life. Addressing the underlying cause can improve your energy levels and overall well-being.\n\n**In summary, please contact your neurologist promptly. Describe your symptoms thoroughly and follow their recommendations for testing and treatment.** Don't wait \u2013 it's always best to be proactive when it comes to your health, especially with epilepsy.\n"

    "answer": "I understand how incredibly stressful and frustrating this situation must be for both your relative and your entire family. To have a young person experiencing these episodes, coupled with diagnostic uncertainty, is a difficult burden to bear.  I am an AI assistant and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical consultation or treatment. Here\u2019s a breakdown of possible avenues to explore, and questions to consider, to help guide your next steps:\n\n**1. Detailed Seizure/Episode Characterization:**\n\n*   **Documentation is key:**  Start a very detailed log.  For *every* episode, record:\n    *   **Date and Time:** Precisely when it occurred.\n    *   **Preceding Events:** What was she doing immediately before?  Was she stressed, tired, hungry, dehydrated, or experiencing any specific emotions? What was the environment like (temperature, noise, lighting)?\n    *   **Witness Account:**  What did others observe? This is crucial, as she may not remember details. Specifically:\n        *   Did her eyes roll back?  Did she lose color in her face?\n        *   Was there any muscle stiffening (tonic phase) or jerking/shaking (clonic phase)?  If so, where on the body?\n        *   Did she bite her tongue or lose bowel/bladder control?\n        *   How long did the episode last?  Be precise.\n        *   What was her state *immediately* after?  Confused, drowsy, headache, muscle soreness, etc.\n    *   **Her Recollection:**  What does *she* remember feeling or experiencing before, during, and after? Even if it's just a \"feeling\" or a vague sensation, record it.  Did she have an aura (a specific sensory experience that precedes a seizure)?\n    *   **Menstrual Cycle Correlation:**  Document her periods meticulously.  Note the days when she's premenstrual, menstruating, and in other phases of her cycle.  Is there a consistent pattern?\n*   **Video Recording:** If possible (and ethical in the environment), try to discreetly video-record an episode. This can be invaluable for neurologists to see what's happening.\n\n**2. Re-Evaluation of the Epilepsy Diagnosis:**\n\n*   **Seizure Type:**  There are many different types of seizures. The description suggests a possible generalized tonic-clonic seizure (the \"shaking\" type), but it's important to determine *exactly* what kind of seizures she's experiencing.  The \"losing memory\" episodes might be a different type of seizure altogether (e.g., absence seizures or focal seizures with impaired awareness).\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  Has she had an EEG done recently?  A standard EEG only captures brain activity for a short period.  Consider asking about:\n    *   **Ambulatory EEG:**  This involves wearing an EEG monitor for 24-72 hours (or even longer) to capture brain activity over a longer period, increasing the chance of detecting abnormalities.\n    *   **Video-EEG Monitoring:**  This combines EEG with video recording, allowing doctors to correlate brain activity with her physical symptoms.  This is often done in a hospital setting.\n*   **Review of EEG Results:**  Ask the neurologist to thoroughly explain the EEG results and what they indicate (or don't indicate).  If you have copies of the EEG reports, get a second opinion from a different neurologist.\n*   **Medication Review:**\n    *   **Specific Medications:** What specific anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) has she tried?  What were the dosages?\n    *   **Side Effects:**  What side effects did she experience? Sometimes, side effects can mimic or exacerbate other conditions.\n    *   **Compliance:**  Is she taking the medication exactly as prescribed?  Missed doses can significantly impact seizure control.\n    *   **Drug Interactions:**  Is she taking any other medications (including over-the-counter drugs or supplements) that could interact with the AEDs?\n    *   **Genetic Testing:** It is worth doing a genetic epilepsy panel to rule out genetic mutations that are leading to seizures and to guide medication choices.\n\n**3.  Exploring Alternative Diagnoses (Given the Diagnostic Uncertainty):**\n\n*   **Cardiac Issues:**\n    *   **Syncope (Fainting):**  Since she's losing consciousness, it's crucial to rule out cardiac causes.  Ask for a referral to a cardiologist.\n    *   **EKG (Electrocardiogram):**  This measures the electrical activity of the heart and can detect arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).\n    *   **Holter Monitor:**  Similar to an ambulatory EEG, this is a portable EKG monitor worn for 24-48 hours (or longer) to detect intermittent heart problems.\n    *   **Echocardiogram:**  This ultrasound of the heart can identify structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Tilt Table Test:** This tests for vasovagal syncope or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).\n*   **Neurological Issues (Besides Epilepsy & MS):**\n    *   **Migraine with Aura:** Some types of migraine can cause neurological symptoms that mimic seizures.\n    *   **Narcolepsy:**  This sleep disorder can cause excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), which could be mistaken for a seizure.\n    *   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a condition where there are neurological symptoms (like seizures, weakness, or sensory changes) that are not caused by structural damage to the brain or nervous system, but rather by problems with how the brain functions. FND is often triggered by stress or emotional factors.\n*   **Endocrine/Metabolic Issues:**\n    *   **Blood Sugar:** Check for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), especially if episodes occur after skipping meals.\n    *   **Electrolytes:**  Imbalances in electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) can sometimes cause neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Hormone Levels:**  Given the possible link to her menstrual cycle, hormone testing (estrogen, progesterone, etc.) might be helpful, especially if a gynecologist suspects perimenstrual epilepsy.\n*   **Psychiatric Conditions:**\n    *   **Panic Attacks:** Severe panic attacks can sometimes cause physical symptoms that resemble seizures.\n    *   **Dissociative Disorders:**  These disorders can cause episodes of detachment from reality or a sense of being outside one's body.\n\n**4.  Seeking Expert Opinions and Collaboration:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Specialist (Epileptologist):**  If possible, seek out an epileptologist. They have specialized expertise in diagnosing and treating epilepsy.  Ask for a referral to a Level 4 Epilepsy Center (these centers have the most advanced diagnostic and treatment options).\n*   **Multidisciplinary Approach:**  This situation may require a team approach involving a neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, psychiatrist, and potentially other specialists.  Encourage communication and collaboration among the doctors.\n*   **Second Opinions:** Don't hesitate to get second opinions from other specialists, especially if you're feeling uncertain about the diagnosis or treatment plan.\n\n**5.  Lifestyle Modifications and Safety Precautions:**\n\n*   **Safety:**\n    *   **Avoid Driving:**  She should not drive until her seizures are well-controlled and her doctor gives her clearance.\n    *   **Supervision:**  Consider having someone with her during activities that could be dangerous if she were to have a seizure (e.g., cooking, bathing).\n    *   **Protective Gear:**  If she's prone to falls, consider wearing a helmet to protect her head.\n*   **Lifestyle:**\n    *   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Ensure she gets adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night). Sleep deprivation can trigger seizures.\n    *   **Stress Management:**  Teach her relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, meditation, yoga) to manage stress.\n    *   **Diet:**  A healthy, balanced diet is important.  Some people with epilepsy find that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, very low-carbohydrate) can help control seizures, but this should only be done under the supervision of a doctor and dietitian.\n    *   **Avoid Triggers:**  If any specific triggers are identified (e.g., flashing lights, alcohol, certain foods), she should avoid them.\n\n**6. Perimenstrual Epilepsy**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Perimenstrual epilepsy is a form of catamenial epilepsy in which seizures tend to cluster around the time of menstruation. If seizures tend to cluster in the perimenstrual phase, the diagnosis should be considered.\n*   **Treatment:** Additional medication may be considered during the perimenstrual phase. Clobazam has been studied and found effective.\n*   **Additional treatment options:** Hormonal treatment using progestin or progesterone has been shown to be effective.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask the Doctors:**\n\n*   \"What are all the possible diagnoses we need to consider?\"\n*   \"What specific tests are needed to rule out each of those diagnoses?\"\n*   \"What are the potential risks and benefits of each test and treatment?\"\n*   \"What is the long-term prognosis?\"\n*   \"What are the resources available to help us cope with this situation?\"\n*   \"How can we best communicate with you and the other members of the medical team?\"\n\n**Supporting Your Relative:**\n\n*   **Empathy and Understanding:**  Acknowledge how difficult this is for her.  Listen to her concerns and fears without judgment.\n*   **Advocacy:**  Help her advocate for herself with the doctors.  Attend appointments with her to take notes and ask questions.\n*   **Practical Support:**  Offer practical help with daily tasks, such as cooking, cleaning, and transportation.\n*   **Emotional Support:**  Encourage her to seek counseling or join a support group.  Living with a chronic illness can be emotionally challenging.\n*   **Patience:**  Finding the right diagnosis and treatment can take time.  Be patient and supportive throughout the process.\n\nIt's essential to be proactive, persistent, and informed. Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek second opinions, and advocate for your relative's health. The more information you gather and the more perspectives you get, the better equipped you'll be to navigate this challenging situation. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious about coming off Keppra, especially given your experience with postpartum eclampsia and the responsibility of caring for your newborn. Let's break down your concerns and what you can discuss with your neurologist.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation:**\n\n*   **Postpartum Eclampsia and Seizures:** You are correct that the seizures were triggered by the high blood pressure associated with postpartum eclampsia. This is different from epilepsy, where seizures are recurrent and unprovoked. Eclamptic seizures are usually a one-time event related to the pregnancy complication.\n*   **Keppra for Prophylaxis:** The neurologist prescribed Keppra as a preventative measure (prophylaxis) to reduce the risk of further seizures while your body recovered from the eclampsia. This is a common practice in such cases.\n*   **Blood Pressure Control:** The fact that your blood pressure is now well-controlled is a very positive sign and significantly reduces the likelihood of another seizure related to eclampsia.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns:**\n\n1.  **Risk of Seizure After Stopping Keppra:**\n    *   Your biggest fear is understandably having another seizure when alone with your baby. **It's crucial to discuss this fear explicitly with your neurologist.**\n    *   Given that your seizures were directly linked to high blood pressure from eclampsia, and your blood pressure is now normalized, the risk of a seizure *solely* due to stopping Keppra is likely very low.\n    *   *However*, sudden discontinuation of any anti-seizure medication, even in someone without epilepsy, can theoretically lower the seizure threshold. This is why a gradual taper is often preferred.\n    *   Ask the neurologist to quantify the risk as best as they can based on your specific case. Get a clear explanation of why they believe the risk is low.\n    *   Consider asking for a second opinion from another neurologist if you remain unconvinced.\n\n2.  **Keppra Withdrawal Side Effects:**\n    *   Keppra can cause side effects during withdrawal, although the severity varies greatly from person to person. Common side effects include:\n        *   Mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression)\n        *   Sleep disturbances (insomnia, fatigue)\n        *   Headaches\n        *   Dizziness\n        *   Nausea\n    *   These side effects are more common with abrupt discontinuation, so a slow taper is usually recommended.\n    *   **The fact that you've only been on Keppra for a short time (less than a month) *may* reduce the risk of significant withdrawal symptoms**, but it's not a guarantee. Everyone reacts differently.\n\n3.  **Tapering vs. Abrupt Discontinuation:**\n    *   **Advocate for a gradual taper.** A slow, controlled reduction in dosage gives your body time to adjust and minimizes the potential for withdrawal symptoms.\n    *   Discuss the tapering schedule with your neurologist. A typical taper might involve reducing the dose by 250mg or 500mg every few days or every week, depending on how you feel.\n    *   **Emphasize your need for a conservative approach.** Tell the neurologist that you would prefer a very slow taper to minimize the risk of any adverse effects that could impact your ability to care for your newborn.\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Neurologist (and Possible Second Opinion):**\n\n*   **Quantify the risk:** Ask the neurologist to estimate the likelihood of having another seizure after stopping Keppra, given your specific circumstances (postpartum eclampsia, controlled blood pressure, short duration of Keppra use).\n*   **Tapering schedule:** Discuss a detailed tapering schedule. Ask what the recommended dose reductions are and over what time frame. Make sure you both agree on a schedule that you are comfortable with.\n*   **Monitoring and support:** Ask what to watch out for in terms of withdrawal symptoms. Ask how to reach them if you experience problems during the tapering process.\n*   **Alternative options:** Ask if there are any alternative approaches, such as a very slow taper over a longer period.\n*   **Impact on newborn care:** Specifically emphasize your concerns about being able to safely care for your newborn during the tapering process. Explain that you need to be in a stable condition.\n*   **Second opinion:** If you are still not comfortable with the neurologist's recommendations, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist. This can provide you with additional reassurance and different perspectives.\n\n**Practical Steps:**\n\n*   **Keep a journal:** Track your Keppra dosage and any symptoms you experience during the tapering process. This will help you and your neurologist adjust the schedule if needed.\n*   **Enlist support:** If possible, arrange for extra help with your newborn during the tapering period. This could be from your partner, family, or friends.\n*   **Safety plan:** Have a plan in place in case you experience any concerning symptoms. Know who to call and where to go for help.\n\n**In summary, while the risk of a seizure specifically caused by stopping Keppra is likely low given your history, a gradual taper is the safest approach to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms. Advocate for a detailed discussion with your neurologist, and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you're not completely satisfied with the answers you receive.**\n"

    "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, that's a lot to unpack, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling anxious and confused. Let's break down your questions and the potential implications of what you've described, remembering that I am an AI and this is not medical advice, but rather information to help you better understand your situation and ask informed questions to your medical team.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\nYou've presented a complex picture with multiple possible contributing factors, complicated by your pre-existing conditions. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n*   **Initial Event:** Loss of consciousness, convulsions, and temporary cessation of breathing. This is strongly suggestive of a seizure.\n*   **Brain Lesion:** An 8mm lesion detected on imaging, initially suspected to be cancerous, now considered vascular in nature.\n*   **Carotid Artery Narrowing:** Identified via CTA, potentially a dissection.\n*   **Neurological Symptoms:** \"Electric shock\" sensation in the hand and head prior to the initial event. Recurring \"pit of my stomach\" sensation similar to the feeling before the initial event.\n*   **Medication Intolerance:** Negative reaction to Keppra. Currently on Vimpat.\n*   **Comorbidities:** Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. These conditions significantly increase your risk of vascular issues.\n\n**Addressing Your Questions**\n\n1.  **\"Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature?\"**\n\n    *   **Potentially Both:** This is the crux of the issue, and why you are seeing both neurologists and neurosurgeons. The symptoms you describe (loss of consciousness, convulsions) are highly suggestive of a seizure. However, the vascular lesion and carotid artery narrowing could be playing a significant role, either independently or in combination. It is possible that the vascular issues *triggered* the initial seizure, and the recurring \"pit of the stomach\" feelings could be either:\n        *   **Auras:** The initial phase of a seizure, acting as a warning sign.\n        *   **TIAs (Transient Ischemic Attacks):** Mini-strokes caused by temporary disruptions in blood flow to the brain. These can sometimes be mistaken for seizures, and the feeling you have might be a warning.\n        *   **Anxiety Related:** The anxiety caused by the fear of another seizure can cause real physical symptoms.\n    *   **Important:** The cerebral angiogram will be crucial to determine the nature and severity of the vascular issue. It will give the neurosurgeon a much clearer picture of the carotid artery narrowing and the lesion itself.\n\n2.  **\"Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner.\"**\n\n    *   **Yes, both a dissection and a TIA can potentially cause seizures:** While TIAs are more typically associated with focal neurological deficits (weakness on one side, speech difficulties), they can sometimes trigger seizures, especially if they affect certain areas of the brain.\n    *   **Dissection:** A carotid artery dissection, where the layers of the artery wall separate, can cause a stroke or TIA. The disruption of blood flow can irritate the brain and lead to seizures.\n    *   **Your Initial Attack:** The initial attack could have been a seizure *caused by* a TIA or the initial stages of the carotid dissection. This would explain the convulsive activity and loss of consciousness.\n    *   **Why TIAs present differently online:** Online resources often provide general descriptions, but the presentation of a TIA can vary greatly depending on the location and extent of the blood flow disruption. Seizures are less common presentations of a TIA, so are not at the forefront of the general list.\n\n3.  **\"Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)?\"**\n\n    *   **Not necessarily:** The duration of your seizure medication will depend on the underlying cause and your response to treatment.\n        *   **If the seizures are directly linked to the vascular issue:** If the carotid artery problem is corrected or managed, and the seizures stop, your doctor might consider gradually weaning you off the medication *under close supervision*.\n        *   **If you are diagnosed with epilepsy:** You may require long-term medication. However, even in this case, there may be opportunities to adjust the dosage or try different medications to minimize side effects.\n        *   **Communicate with your doctor:** It is crucial to communicate your side effects from Vimpat. There are other anti-seizure medications available, and your doctor can work with you to find one that provides better control with fewer side effects.\n        *   **Lifestyle Factors:** Addressing your comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension) through diet, exercise, and medication can significantly improve your overall health and potentially reduce the need for medication in the long term.\n\n4.  **\"Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?\"**\n\n    *   **Possibly, but it's not a definitive diagnosis yet:** Epilepsy is defined as having two or more unprovoked seizures. A single seizure, especially if triggered by a specific event like a TIA or dissection, doesn't automatically mean you have epilepsy. Your doctors need to determine if the seizures are likely to recur without a clear, identifiable trigger. This is still being determined, especially as the angiogram tomorrow may shed more light on the situation.\n\n**What to Do Now**\n\n*   **Attend your cerebral angiogram:** This is the most important next step. It will provide critical information about the carotid artery narrowing and the vascular lesion.\n*   **Prepare Questions for Your Doctors:** Write down all your questions and concerns before your appointments with both the neurologist and neurosurgeon.\n*   **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Keep a detailed record of any symptoms you experience, including the \"pit of my stomach\" feeling, any other unusual sensations, and the time of day they occur. This will help your doctors identify patterns and make a more accurate diagnosis.\n*   **Communicate Openly:** Be honest with your doctors about your side effects from the medication. Don't suffer in silence!\n*   **Focus on Lifestyle:** While waiting for the angiogram results and further evaluation, focus on managing your weight, blood sugar, and blood pressure through diet, exercise, and medication. This will improve your overall health and reduce your risk of future vascular events.\n*   **Seek Support:** Talk to your wife, family, or a therapist about your anxieties and concerns. Dealing with these issues can be overwhelming, and having a strong support system is essential.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   Your situation is complex and requires careful evaluation by a multidisciplinary team.\n*   The cerebral angiogram is a crucial diagnostic test.\n*   Open communication with your doctors about your symptoms and concerns is vital.\n*   Managing your comorbidities is essential for long-term health.\n*   It is very possible you may have had a seizure triggered by a vascular event (dissection or TIA). It is also possible that you have developed epilepsy. Both are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThis information is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please discuss your concerns with your medical team. I wish you the best of luck with your angiogram and your ongoing treatment.\n"

    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and try to provide some clarity. It's understandable that you're concerned, especially with a history of epilepsy and new neurological symptoms. I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice, please see a doctor.\n\n**Summary of Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Head Shaking Sensation:** Perceived shaking when pressing your forehead against a pillow or other surface.\n*   **Limb Twitching:** Visible but not necessarily *felt* twitching in your left arm and right leg, starting approximately 5 days ago.\n*   **Possible Night Shaking:** Unsure about a shaking feeling during sleep.\n*   **Epilepsy History:** Absence seizures only.\n*   **Medication:** Epilim (valproic acid) - 6 tablets daily.\n\n**Possible Causes & Considerations:**\n\nGiven the information you've provided, here's a breakdown of possibilities, keeping in mind I'm an AI and can't diagnose you.\n\n1.  **Medication Side Effects:**\n\n    *   **Epilim (Valproic Acid):** While generally well-tolerated, valproic acid *can* have neurological side effects. Tremors, muscle twitching (myoclonus), and other movement-related problems are known possibilities. The timing of the symptoms appearing after being on the medication for a longer period doesn't rule it out; side effects can sometimes develop later.\n\n2.  **Stress and Anxiety:**\n\n    *   Doctors have suggested stress. Anxiety and stress *can* definitely manifest physically. Muscle fasciculations (the small, local muscle twitches) are very commonly associated with stress. This is especially true if you're hyper-focused on your body and noticing every little sensation.\n    *   However, it's important not to dismiss your symptoms as *only* stress, especially given your epilepsy history.\n\n3.  **Epilepsy-Related Issues:**\n\n    *   **Subtle Seizures:** Although you've only had absence seizures, it's important to consider if these new symptoms could be related to subtle, partial seizures or other seizure activity that you're not consciously aware of.\n    *   **Medication Adjustment Needed:** Perhaps your current medication dosage isn't fully controlling your seizures, or you've developed a tolerance to it.\n\n4.  **Other Neurological Conditions:**\n\n    *   While less likely given your age and history, other conditions that cause tremors or muscle twitching (e.g., essential tremor, dystonia) could potentially be considered.\n\n**What to Do in the Meantime (While Waiting for the Neurologist):**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**\n\n    *   **Time of Day:** When do the twitching and head shaking sensation occur?\n    *   **Triggers:** Anything that seems to make them worse (stress, specific positions, etc.)?\n    *   **Duration:** How long do the episodes last?\n    *   **Severity:** Rate the intensity of the sensations.\n    *   **Other Symptoms:** Note anything else you experience at the same time (e.g., anxiety, lightheadedness, confusion).\n\n*   **Review Your Epilim Dosage:**\n\n    *   Talk to your pharmacist or GP (General Practitioner) about your current Epilim dosage. Are you taking it correctly? Are there any potential interactions with other medications or supplements?\n\n*   **Manage Stress:**\n\n    *   While stress may not be the *sole* cause, reducing stress is always beneficial. Try relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation), regular exercise (if appropriate), and ensuring adequate sleep.\n\n*   **Avoid Potential Triggers:**\n\n    *   Identify if certain postures, movements, or activities trigger the head shaking sensation or twitching, and try to avoid them.\n\n*   **Record Videos:**\n\n    *   If you can, try to record the twitching with your phone. This can be very helpful for the neurologist to see what's happening.\n\n*   **Contact Your GP or Neurologist if Symptoms Worsen:**\n\n    *   If the twitching becomes more frequent, severe, or spreads to other parts of your body, or if you develop new symptoms (e.g., weakness, numbness, vision changes), don't wait for the appointment. Contact your doctor immediately.\n\n**Why Seeing a Neurologist is Important:**\n\nThe neurologist will be able to:\n\n*   **Conduct a Thorough Neurological Examination:** This will help assess your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, and sensation.\n*   **Order Appropriate Tests:** An EEG (electroencephalogram) can help detect abnormal brain activity, and an MRI of the brain might be necessary to rule out structural problems. Blood tests can assess your Epilim levels and rule out other medical conditions.\n*   **Review Your Medication:** The neurologist can determine if your Epilim dosage needs adjusting or if a different medication is more appropriate.\n*   **Provide a Diagnosis:** Based on the examination and test results, the neurologist can provide an accurate diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Valproic Acid and Pregnancy:**  Since you're a male, this isn't directly relevant to you, but it's always worth knowing that valproic acid can cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. It's not a concern *for you*, but it is important information to keep in mind if you are ever planning to have children with a partner, as it can affect the health of a developing fetus if the *mother* is taking it.\n*   **Driving:** Depending on your seizure control and the regulations in the UK, you may need to inform the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) about your epilepsy. The neurologist can advise you on this.\n\nIt's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot offer medical advice. This information is intended to be educational and should not be a substitute for professional medical care. If you have health concerns, please seek a qualified healthcare provider.\n"

    "answer": "Okay, what you experienced sounds like a syncopal episode, commonly known as fainting. There are a few reasons why this might have happened, especially given the circumstances you described. It's good you're thinking about potential underlying issues, but in many cases, it's a one-off event or related to specific triggers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential causes and what you should consider:\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the most common type of fainting. It's triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, which reduces blood flow to the brain. Triggers can include:\n    *   **Heat and Dehydration:** Being at a pool, especially if it was hot, can lead to dehydration and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), both of which lower blood pressure.\n    *   **Standing Up Quickly:** Sudden changes in posture can cause blood to pool in your legs, reducing blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Emotional Stress or Pain:** Even if you weren't consciously stressed, the combination of factors could have triggered a vasovagal response.\n    *   **Marijuana Use:** Marijuana can lower blood pressure in some individuals, which could have contributed to the fainting episode, particularly in combination with the other factors listed above.\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:** This is a drop in blood pressure when you stand up. Similar to vasovagal syncope, it results in reduced blood flow to the brain. Dehydration can worsen this.\n*   **Marijuana and Blood Pressure:** As mentioned above, marijuana can affect blood pressure. Some people experience a drop in blood pressure when using it, especially when combined with other factors like heat and dehydration.\n*   **Seizure:** Although you say you were just \"flopping around uncontrollably\", the description also sounds a lot like what a seizure might be, if possible can you ask the people around you when it happened if they remember and maybe even a video from the pool could help understand what happened\n*   **Other Medical Conditions:** While less likely given your age and lack of prior history, fainting can sometimes be a symptom of:\n    *   **Heart Problems:** Certain heart conditions can cause irregular heart rhythms or structural issues that reduce blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Neurological Conditions:** In rare cases, fainting can be related to neurological problems.\n\n**Why the Marijuana Connection?**\n\n*   **Lowered Blood Pressure:** As mentioned, marijuana can lower blood pressure, making you more susceptible to fainting, especially when combined with other factors.\n*   **Dehydration:** Marijuana can sometimes cause dry mouth, which might contribute to dehydration if you're not drinking enough fluids.\n*   **Interaction with Heat:** The combination of marijuana, heat, and potential dehydration could have been enough to trigger the syncopal episode.\n\n**What to Do Now:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor:** This is the most important step. Explain to your doctor what happened, including the context of the marijuana use, the environment (heat, pool), and how you felt before and after the episode. Be honest about the marijuana use; it's important for your doctor to have all the information to make an accurate assessment. They can perform a physical exam, check your blood pressure and heart rate, and potentially order tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n2.  **Be Prepared to Answer Questions:** Your doctor will likely ask about:\n    *   Your medical history (including any family history of heart problems, fainting, or seizures).\n    *   Your medication use (including any over-the-counter medications, supplements, or recreational drugs).\n    *   The circumstances surrounding the fainting episode (what you were doing, how you felt before, during, and after).\n    *   Any other symptoms you've been experiencing.\n3.  **Consider a Cardiologist Referral:** Depending on your doctor's initial assessment, they might refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist) for further evaluation, especially if they suspect a heart-related issue.\n4.  **Stay Hydrated:** In the meantime, make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids, especially when you're in hot environments or engaging in physical activity.\n5.  **Avoid Sudden Changes in Posture:** Stand up slowly, especially if you've been sitting or lying down for a while.\n6.  **Be Cautious with Marijuana:** Given that the fainting episode occurred in conjunction with marijuana use, it might be wise to avoid it, at least until you've been evaluated by a doctor.\n7.  **Inform Your Friends:** Let your friends know what happened so they can be aware and offer support if something similar happens again.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Honesty with Your Doctor:** It's crucial to be honest with your doctor about your marijuana use. They need this information to provide the best possible care. They are not there to judge you, but to help you.\n*   **Psychological Factors:** You mentioned psychological issues. Anxiety and panic can sometimes trigger fainting episodes in susceptible individuals. If you have anxiety, discuss this with your doctor, as it could be a contributing factor.\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's tempting to try to figure out what happened on your own, but it's best to let a medical professional evaluate you and provide a diagnosis.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhat you experienced sounds like a syncopal episode (fainting). The combination of marijuana use, heat, dehydration, and possibly sudden changes in posture likely contributed to the event. While it might have been a one-time occurrence, it's important to see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Be honest with your doctor about your marijuana use and any other relevant factors. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment or preventive measures."

    "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a very concerning situation, and I understand your worry and need to understand what might have happened to your professor. **It is extremely important to reiterate that I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses.** Only a qualified medical professional can properly evaluate and diagnose your professor's condition.\n\nHowever, I can offer some potential considerations based on your detailed observations, keeping in mind that this is purely speculative and for informational purposes only.\n\n**Possible Considerations, with Caveats:**\n\n*   **Seizure:** While the professor denied epilepsy, a first-time seizure is possible, especially at his age. Seizures can manifest in diverse ways.\n\n    *   *Focal Seizure with Impaired Awareness (Complex Partial Seizure):* This type of seizure can involve:\n        *   A period of unresponsiveness or altered awareness (the \"freezing\").\n        *   Automatisms: Repetitive, involuntary movements like the unusual \"smile\" or head turning.\n        *   Emotional changes or unusual sensations, potentially contributing to the laughter.\n        *   Postictal State: Confusion, disorientation, and fatigue after the seizure.\n\n    *   *Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure (Grand Mal Seizure):* This type of seizure typically involves loss of consciousness, stiffening (tonic phase), and jerking movements (clonic phase), followed by a postictal state. The foaming at the mouth and loss of consciousness are consistent with this, although the preceding symptoms are less typical. The fall and head injury could have been a result of the seizure.\n\n    *   **Important note:** A single seizure does *not* automatically mean epilepsy. It could be triggered by various underlying issues.\n\n*   **Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident):** While you mentioned that stroke descriptions didn't entirely fit, it's still a possibility.\n\n    *   The initial freezing could have been due to a sudden interruption of blood flow to a specific area of the brain.\n    *   The unusual smile and head turning could potentially be related to weakness or paralysis on one side of the face/body.\n    *   However, the laughter is less typical of a straightforward stroke presentation.\n    *   The fall and head injury could mask stroke symptoms, or complicate the evaluation.\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** A \"mini-stroke\" where blood flow to the brain is temporarily interrupted. TIA symptoms are similar to stroke symptoms but resolve within a short period (usually less than an hour). It is a major risk factor for stroke.\n\n*   **Syncope (Fainting):** Less likely, but possible, especially given the fall. Syncope can sometimes be preceded by unusual sensations or movements. However, the length of unconsciousness (5-7 minutes) and the other symptoms are less typical.\n\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are other, less common neurological conditions that could potentially explain the symptoms.\n\n*   **Cardiac Arrhythmia:** An irregular heartbeat can sometimes lead to reduced blood flow to the brain, causing symptoms similar to syncope or even stroke-like symptoms.\n\n*   **Head Trauma:** The head injury could have independently caused or contributed to the loss of consciousness and other symptoms. The blood from the ear is definitely concerning for a skull fracture.\n\n**Regarding the Laughter:**\n\nThe laughter is an atypical symptom that makes it difficult to pinpoint a specific cause. It could be:\n\n*   **Gelastic Seizure:** A rare type of focal seizure that causes uncontrollable laughter or giggling.\n*   **A manifestation of brainstem involvement:** Some brainstem strokes or other neurological issues affecting the brainstem can result in unusual emotional displays.\n*   **Complicated by head trauma:** The laughter could have been a result of head trauma alone.\n*   **Atypical seizure activity:** Seizures can sometimes present with unexpected symptoms.\n\n**The Blood from the Ear:**\n\nThe blood from the ear is a very serious sign and strongly suggests a skull fracture. It increases the likelihood that the head injury played a significant role.\n\n**What's Important Now:**\n\n*   **The ambulance has been called, which is the most important step.** The paramedics and doctors will assess your professor's condition and transport him to the hospital for further evaluation.\n*   **The doctors will likely perform a thorough neurological exam, including a CT scan or MRI of the brain.** These tests will help them identify any signs of stroke, seizure, head trauma, or other underlying conditions.\n*   **The doctors will likely run blood tests.**\n*   **Provide as much information as possible to the medical staff.** Your detailed observations of the event are invaluable to them. Tell them everything you saw, in chronological order.\n\n**What you observed suggests a serious medical event requiring immediate medical attention. I hope your professor receives the best possible care and makes a full recovery.** Please understand that I cannot provide a diagnosis and that you should rely on the expertise of the medical professionals who are treating him.\n"

    "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable why you're feeling frustrated and concerned. Dealing with epilepsy and medication access can be stressful, especially when it feels like there are unnecessary hurdles. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and things to consider:\n\n**Why Your Doctor Might Require Regular Appointments**\n\n*   **Monitoring Effectiveness:** Lamotrigine, like many epilepsy medications, needs to be monitored for its effectiveness. Seizure control is the primary goal, and your doctor needs to assess if the current dosage is optimal. They may ask about seizure frequency, severity, and any potential triggers.\n*   **Side Effects:** Lamotrigine has potential side effects, some of which can be serious (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe skin reaction). Regular check-ups allow your doctor to screen for these. They may ask about rashes, mood changes, cognitive difficulties, or other concerning symptoms.\n*   **Adjusting Dosage:** Over time, your body might require dosage adjustments. Factors like weight changes, other medications, and changes in your overall health can influence how Lamotrigine works.\n*   **Checking for Tolerance:** Sometimes, people can develop a tolerance to anti-seizure medications, requiring dosage increases or a change in medication.\n*   **Adherence:** Regular appointments can serve as a check-in to ensure you're taking your medication as prescribed.\n*   **Standard of Care:** Many neurologists follow a standard of care that involves regular follow-up appointments for patients with epilepsy to ensure optimal management.\n\n**Is This Normal?**\n\nWhile it's not *universally* standard, it's *common* for neurologists to require regular appointments (typically every 3-6 months) for epilepsy patients, especially in the first year after diagnosis or when medication changes are made. The frequency can sometimes decrease if your seizures are well-controlled and you've been stable on the same medication for a long time. However, your doctor's insistence on a 6-month appointment before refilling the prescription is within the realm of reasonable practice.\n\n**What's Potentially Problematic**\n\n*   **Lack of Flexibility/Communication:** The biggest issue you raise is the inflexibility. A good doctor-patient relationship involves open communication. It would be more helpful if your doctor or their office proactively reminded you about upcoming appointments and explained the importance of scheduling them in a timely manner.\n*   **Potential for Disruption:** You're right to be concerned about what happens if you *cannot* get an appointment before your medication runs out. Abruptly stopping Lamotrigine can be dangerous and increase the risk of seizures.\n\n**What You Can Do**\n\n1.  **At Your Appointment Tomorrow:**\n    *   **Express Your Concerns:** Clearly explain your worries about the potential gap in medication. \"Doctor, I'm concerned that if I can't get an appointment scheduled in time, I'll run out of medication. This is a life-saving drug for me, and abruptly stopping it could be dangerous. Can we discuss a plan to prevent that from happening?\"\n    *   **Ask About Their Refill Policy:** Ask about their policy on refills between appointments in case of emergency or scheduling conflicts.\n    *   **Request Advance Reminders:** Ask if their office can send reminders about upcoming appointments well in advance.\n    *   **Discuss Alternatives (Maybe):** If you're consistently having trouble scheduling appointments within their required timeframe, you could gently explore if there are other options, such as a longer prescription duration with more frequent check-in calls or a more flexible renewal policy. However, be prepared that they may stick to their current protocol.\n2.  **Be Proactive:**\n    *   **Schedule Appointments Immediately:** Schedule your next appointment *before* you leave the office tomorrow. Put it in your calendar with multiple reminders.\n    *   **Call for Cancellation Slots:** If you can't get an appointment far enough out, ask to be put on a cancellation list so you can be seen sooner if an opening arises.\n    *   **Consider Your Pharmacy:** Many pharmacies have programs to help manage refills and proactively contact doctors. See if your pharmacy offers such a service.\n3.  **Consider a Second Opinion (If Necessary):** If you feel your doctor is consistently inflexible and not responsive to your concerns, you could consider getting a second opinion from another neurologist. Look for someone who is known for their communication skills and patient-centered approach.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Refills:**\n\n*   **State Laws:** Some states have specific laws regarding prescription refills, especially for controlled substances. While Lamotrigine is not a controlled substance, your doctor might be adhering to a broader state-level regulation.\n*   **Insurance Requirements:** Your insurance company may have policies that require regular doctor visits for prescription coverage.\n\n**In summary:** While your doctor's approach isn't necessarily *wrong*, the lack of flexibility and potential for disruption is a valid concern. Focus on open communication, proactive scheduling, and understanding the rationale behind their policies. If you consistently feel unheard or that your needs are not being met, seeking a second opinion is always an option.\n"

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and address your concerns. It's understandable that you're feeling anxious and overwhelmed with this new diagnosis and the impact it's having on your life.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to discuss your specific situation with your neurologist or a qualified healthcare professional. They can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history, test results, and treatment plan.\n\n**Understanding Partial Epilepsy and Your Symptoms**\n\n*   **Partial (Focal) Seizures:**  You're right, partial seizures originate in one area of the brain.  The symptoms can vary widely depending on the location of the seizure focus. Your reported symptoms like burning sensations, memory and concentration problems, and head tightness are consistent with focal seizures affecting certain brain regions.  It's also good to note that \"aura\" can sometimes be seizures themselves as well.\n\n*   **Hippocampus and Memory:**  You are also correct about the hippocampus. It plays a crucial role in memory formation, particularly short-term memory and consolidating memories for long-term storage.  If your seizures are originating in or affecting areas near the hippocampus (like the temporal lobe), it could explain your memory difficulties.\n\n*   **The Burning Sensation:**  This is a less common but not unheard-of seizure symptom. Seizures can sometimes manifest as sensory disturbances, including pain, tingling, or burning sensations. The location of the sensation could give clues as to the area of the brain where the seizure originates.\n\n*   **Neck/Spine Connection:** It is possible that seizure-related muscle tension or referred pain could manifest in the neck or back.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns and Questions**\n\n1.  **Is the Damage to My Short-Term Memory Reversible?**\n\n    *   **Potential for Improvement:** It's difficult to say definitively whether the memory impairment is fully reversible. The degree of reversibility depends on several factors:\n        *   **Seizure Control:**  Effective control of your seizures is the most crucial step.  Reducing the frequency and intensity of seizures may allow the affected brain regions to heal and function better.\n        *   **Duration of Seizures:** The longer seizures have been occurring, the more potential impact they can have on brain function.\n        *   **Underlying Cause:**  While epilepsy itself can cause cognitive problems, the underlying cause of your epilepsy (if known) could also play a role.\n        *   **Neuroplasticity:** The brain has a remarkable ability to adapt and rewire itself (neuroplasticity).  With appropriate treatment and cognitive rehabilitation, it's possible to regain some lost memory function.\n        *   **Medication Side Effects:** Some anti-seizure medications can have side effects that impact cognition. If Zeptol is contributing to your memory problems, your neurologist might consider adjusting the dosage or trying a different medication.\n\n    *   **Realistic Expectations:**  It's important to have realistic expectations.  While improvement is possible, you may not fully recover all of your previous memory function. Focus on strategies to manage your memory problems and improve your quality of life.\n\n2.  **Am I Going to Have Alzheimer's in My 30s?**\n\n    *   **Unlikely, but See a Doctor:**  Having epilepsy does not automatically mean you will develop Alzheimer's disease. However, some studies suggest a slightly increased risk of dementia in people with epilepsy, particularly if seizures are poorly controlled or if epilepsy starts later in life. Dementia is unlikely to occur in the 30s.\n    *   **Rule Out Other Causes:** It is important to rule out other potential causes of your cognitive problems, such as medication side effects, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, or other neurological conditions.\n    *   **Early Detection and Prevention:** Talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your risk of cognitive decline, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly, engaging in mentally stimulating activities, and managing other health conditions.\n    *   **Consider Neuropsychological Testing:** Neuropsychological testing can help assess your cognitive strengths and weaknesses and track any changes in your cognitive function over time.\n\n3.  **Zeptol (Carbamazepine) and Memory**\n\n    *   **Titration Period:** It's only been a week and a half since you started Zeptol, and you've just increased the dose. It takes time for the medication to reach a therapeutic level in your blood and for you to experience its full effects.\n    *   **Side Effects:** Carbamazepine, like other anti-seizure medications, can have side effects that affect cognition, such as drowsiness, confusion, and memory problems. Discuss any side effects you're experiencing with your neurologist.\n    *   **Alternative Medications:** If Zeptol is not effective or if the side effects are too bothersome, there are other anti-seizure medications that your neurologist could consider.\n\n4.  **What to Do Now:**\n\n    *   **Communicate Openly with Your Neurologist:** The most important thing is to have an open and honest conversation with your neurologist about your symptoms, concerns, and how the medication is affecting you.\n    *   **Keep a Seizure Diary:**  Track your seizures (or any unusual sensations or symptoms), as well as any potential triggers, medication side effects, and how you're feeling overall. This information can be very helpful for your neurologist in adjusting your treatment plan.\n    *   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask your neurologist any questions you have about your diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.\n    *   **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you are not comfortable with your diagnosis or treatment plan, you may want to seek a second opinion from another neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.\n    *   **Explore Cognitive Rehabilitation:**  Cognitive rehabilitation can help you develop strategies to improve your memory, attention, and other cognitive skills.\n    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n        *   **Sleep:** Get enough sleep (7-9 hours per night). Sleep deprivation can worsen seizures and cognitive problems.\n        *   **Diet:** Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Some people with epilepsy find that certain dietary changes, such as a ketogenic diet, can help control their seizures. Consult with your doctor or a registered dietitian before making any significant dietary changes.\n        *   **Exercise:** Engage in regular physical activity. Exercise can improve mood, reduce stress, and potentially improve cognitive function.\n        *   **Stress Management:** Practice stress-reduction techniques, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. Stress can be a trigger for seizures in some people.\n    *   **Join a Support Group:** Connecting with other people who have epilepsy can provide emotional support, practical advice, and a sense of community.  Look for local or online support groups.  The Epilepsy Foundation is a good resource.\n    *   **Advocate for Yourself:**  Be proactive in your care and advocate for your needs.  If you're having trouble at work or school, talk to your employer or school officials about accommodations that can help you succeed.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Underlying Cause:** Your neurologist should investigate the underlying cause of your epilepsy.  In some cases, epilepsy is caused by a structural abnormality in the brain, a genetic disorder, or a previous brain injury.\n*   **EEG Monitoring:**  Repeat or prolonged EEG monitoring may be necessary to better characterize your seizures and pinpoint their origin.\n*   **MRI of the Brain:** A high-resolution MRI of the brain can help identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing your seizures.\n\n**In summary:** You're dealing with a complex situation, and it's important to work closely with your neurologist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan. With effective seizure control, appropriate medications, lifestyle modifications, and cognitive rehabilitation, there is a good chance you can improve your memory and quality of life. Don't lose hope, and remember that you are not alone.\n"

    "question": " Yet another EDIT: I fainted today on my way to the store and was brought into the hospital. They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder. Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, first of all, you don't sound insane at all. You're describing very real and frightening experiences, and it's completely understandable that you're trying to find answers. It's great that you've sought medical attention and are sharing what you've learned. Here's a breakdown of what you've shared and some things to keep in mind:\n\n**Key Takeaways from Your Updates:**\n\n*   **Silent Seizures (Non-Convulsive Seizures):** This is a significant finding and explains the \"loss of consciousness\" episodes you've been experiencing. It's good they caught this and that they are addressing it.\n*   **Possible Gastroparesis:** This could very well explain your weight loss, lack of appetite, and difficulty keeping food down. The gastric emptying study will be crucial to confirming this.\n*   **Ruling Out Withdrawal:** Good to clarify that the \"brain zaps\" aren't related to medication withdrawal.\n*   **Ruling Out Eating Disorder:** Important to address this, as unexplained weight loss can sometimes be misattributed.\n\n**What to do NOW:**\n\n*   **Follow Doctor's Instructions:** Adhere closely to the treatment plan your doctors have given you for the seizures. This might include medication. Consistency is key.\n*   **Prepare for Gastric Emptying Study:** Ask your doctor for specific instructions on how to prepare for this study.\n*   **Medication Tracking:** keep a log of the medications they will give you. Take note of side effects and bring these concerns up with your doctor.\n*   **Be Meticulous with Symptoms:** Keep a very detailed log of your symptoms:\n    *   When they occur\n    *   What you were doing before, during, and after\n    *   The intensity of each symptom (use a scale of 1-10)\n    *   Dietary information\n    *   Sleep\n    *   Stress levels\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Neurologist is Key:** A neurologist will be central to your care for the seizures. Make sure you understand the type of seizures you're having, what triggers them, and what to do if you feel one coming on (if possible).\n*   **Gastric Specialist:** A gastroenterologist will be essential for diagnosis and management if you have gastroparesis. There are dietary changes and medications that can help.\n*   **Possible Link:** The fact that you have two potentially distinct issues (seizures and gastroparesis) doesn't necessarily mean they are related, but it's worth exploring with your doctors. Sometimes neurological conditions can affect the digestive system, or vice versa.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't hesitate to ask questions, express concerns, and seek clarification. You have the right to understand your health and treatment plan.\n\n**Important Note:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with your healthcare providers for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n"

    "question": "Age:18 Sex:F Weight:46 kg Height:1.61 cm So i have had histories of deja vu, it usually doesn\u2019t last long. I don\u2019t have them a lot, sometimes more sometime less. I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn\u2019t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can\u2019t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure.

I\u2019d get an EEG but i am literally such a hypochondriac that my parents are concerned and i just went through blood tests and i don\u2019t want to worry them again! If anyone has any idea i\u2019d be so glad :)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety related to your health, especially concerning potential neurological issues. It's completely understandable that you're scared, given the symptoms you're describing and your fear of serious conditions like brain tumors and epilepsy.\n\nHere's a structured approach to understanding what might be going on and what you can do:\n\n**1. Reassessing the Neurologist's Diagnosis:**\n\n*   **Anxiety and OCD:** The neurologist's diagnosis of anxiety with OCD elements is significant. Anxiety can manifest in many physical symptoms, and your heightened focus on bodily sensations (a hallmark of health anxiety/hypochondria) can amplify them. OCD can also involve intrusive thoughts about health, leading to checking behaviors (like constantly monitoring for symptoms).\n\n*   **Neurological Exam:** The fact that the neurologist performed a neurological exam and found no deficits is reassuring. These exams are designed to detect problems with reflexes, coordination, and sensory function, which are often affected by neurological disorders.\n\n*   **Deja Vu and Dream Flashbacks:** Deja vu is a common experience, and while it can be associated with certain types of seizures, it's also frequently reported by healthy individuals, especially during times of stress or fatigue.  Dream flashbacks, especially if fragmented or not fully formed, are less concerning than vivid, intrusive flashbacks associated with trauma.\n\n**2. Analyzing Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Buzzing/Vibrations and Nonsense Thoughts:** These sensations, coupled with racing thoughts, are highly suggestive of anxiety. When you're anxious, your nervous system is in a state of heightened arousal. This can lead to physical sensations like tingling, buzzing, and muscle tremors. The racing, nonsensical thoughts are also typical of anxiety, especially when you're trying to relax and sleep.\n\n*   **Increased Heart Rate and Depersonalization:** A racing heart is a classic anxiety symptom.  Depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings) can also occur during periods of intense anxiety or panic.\n\n*   **Ear Buzzing:** Tinnitus (ear ringing or buzzing) can be caused by a variety of factors, including anxiety, stress, and muscle tension in the head and neck.\n\n*   **Fear of Seizures:** This is a primary driver of your anxiety. It's important to remember that having no history of seizures, combined with a normal neurological exam, significantly reduces the likelihood of a seizure disorder.\n\n**3. Why Anxiety is the More Likely Explanation:**\n\n*   **Symptom Cluster:** The combination of your symptoms \u2013 buzzing, racing thoughts, heart palpitations, depersonalization, fear, and sleep disturbances \u2013 strongly aligns with anxiety.\n*   **Trigger:** Your health anxiety acts as a potent trigger, creating a feedback loop where you focus on normal bodily sensations, interpret them as dangerous, and then experience more anxiety, which in turn amplifies the sensations.\n*   **Normal Exam:** The normal findings on the neurological exam are very reassuring.\n*   **Age:** While neurological issues can occur at any age, anxiety disorders are very common in young adults.\n\n**4. Addressing Your Concerns and Reducing Anxiety:**\n\n*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This is an excellent treatment for anxiety and health anxiety. CBT helps you identify and challenge negative thought patterns and develop coping mechanisms for managing anxiety. Specifically, CBT would help you address your catastrophic thoughts about brain tumors and seizures.\n*   **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP):** A type of CBT that is particularly effective for OCD and health anxiety. ERP involves gradually exposing yourself to your fears (e.g., thinking about seizures) without engaging in safety behaviors (e.g., constantly checking for symptoms).\n*   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Practicing mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety. There are many apps and online resources that can guide you.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:** Establishing a regular sleep routine, creating a relaxing bedtime environment, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed can improve sleep quality.\n*   **Talk to Your Parents:** While you're concerned about worrying them, open and honest communication with your parents can be very helpful. Explain how you're feeling and that you're working to manage your anxiety.  They might be able to help you find a therapist or support you in other ways.  Reassure them you are following the advice of medical professionals.\n*   **Consider Another Appointment:** If your anxiety is significantly impacting your life, and you are unable to find relief through self-help strategies, speak with your parents and consider scheduling another visit with your doctor or a mental health professional. Perhaps a different approach to the therapy can be implemented.\n*   **Limit Health Information Seeking:** Resist the urge to constantly search the internet for information about brain tumors or epilepsy. This will only fuel your anxiety.\n\n**5. When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention:**\n\nWhile it's likely your symptoms are due to anxiety, it's essential to know when to seek immediate medical attention.  Go to the emergency room *immediately* if you experience:\n\n*   **A seizure (especially if it's your first one).**\n*   **Sudden, severe headache unlike anything you've experienced before.**\n*   **Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of your body.**\n*   **Sudden difficulty speaking or understanding speech.**\n*   **Sudden vision changes.**\n*   **Loss of consciousness.**\n\n**In summary:** Based on the information you've provided, anxiety is the most likely explanation for your symptoms. A normal neurological exam significantly reduces the likelihood of a serious neurological condition. Focus on managing your anxiety through therapy, relaxation techniques, and lifestyle changes. If you're unsure, always err on the side of caution and seek medical advice. Continue to communicate with medical professionals for reassurance and further testing if you or they feel it is necessary.\n"

    "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3\u2019s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I am so incredibly sorry you are going through this. It's clear you are dealing with significant chronic pain and navigating a healthcare system that is often dismissive and invalidating. You are doing everything right by advocating for yourself and seeking answers. It's completely understandable that you are frustrated and concerned about your increasing pain, seizure risk, and potential drug dependency.\n\nHere's a breakdown of possible steps you can take in the immediate and near future:\n\n**Immediate Actions (Today/Tomorrow):**\n\n*   **Document Everything:** Start keeping a detailed pain journal. Include:\n    *   **Pain Scale:** Rate your pain from 1-10.\n    *   **Location:** Be specific about where the pain is, including if it radiates.\n    *   **Type of Pain:** Describe the pain (sharp, stabbing, dull, throbbing, etc.).\n    *   **Triggers:** Note anything that seems to make the pain worse.\n    *   **Relieving Factors:** Note anything that seems to make the pain better (heat, position changes, medication, etc.).\n    *   **Medication Use:** Record the exact time and dosage of each medication you take.\n    *   **Symptoms:** Note any accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, bowel changes, etc.).\n*   **Contact Your Surgeon:** As you mentioned, this is your priority for tomorrow. Explain the situation in detail to their office. Emphasize the increased pain, the ER visits, the dismissive doctor, and your concerns about torsion. Ask if you can be seen sooner, even if it's by a different doctor within their practice. If they can't see you sooner, ask them if they have recommendations on how to manage the pain in the meantime, or if they know any urgent care clinics with doctors specialized in endo who may be able to help.\n*   **Consider a Different ER/Hospital:** If your surgeon's office can't help, consider going to a different ER, especially one associated with a teaching hospital or one that has a reputation for good women's health care. Sometimes a change of scenery and different perspectives can make a difference. Explain your history and your concerns about torsion very clearly. Be prepared to advocate for yourself.\n*   **Reframing at the ER:** When speaking with healthcare professionals, consider using language like \"I am concerned about acute ovarian pain and the possibility of torsion, as indicated by my symptoms of sharp pain, radiation to my back, and rebound tenderness. My history of PCOS and endometriosis, along with the observation of multiple follicles on my ovaries, increases my risk.\" This may help them take you more seriously than framing the situation as chronic pain.\n*   **Advocate for Specific Tests:** If you go to the ER again, politely but firmly request a repeat ultrasound, specifically with Doppler flow, to assess blood flow to the ovary. If the ultrasound is inconclusive and pain persists, request an MRI. While CT scans can rule out some issues, they are not as good as an MRI for visualizing the ovaries and surrounding tissues.\n*   **Lean on Your Support System:** Talk to your friends, family, or partner. They can offer emotional support and help you advocate for yourself.\n*   **Warm Baths/Heating Pads:** These can sometimes provide temporary relief.\n\n**Near-Future Actions (Next Week/Month):**\n\n*   **Consult a Different Gynecologist:** See if you can find another gynecologist who specializes in endometriosis and pelvic pain, even if it's for a one-time consultation. A fresh perspective can be incredibly valuable.\n*   **Explore Pain Management Options (Non-Narcotic Focused):**\n    *   **Neuropathic Pain Medications:** Talk to a doctor about medications like gabapentin or pregabalin, which can help with nerve pain that is often associated with endometriosis. Lamotrigine can also help, but you're already on that. Be cautious about increasing lamotrigine dosage without consulting your doctor as it could worsen your seizures.\n    *   **Muscle Relaxants:** Medications like baclofen or cyclobenzaprine can help with muscle spasms in the pelvic region.\n    *   **Topical Pain Relief:** Capsaicin cream or lidocaine patches can be applied directly to painful areas.\n    *   **Alternative Therapies:** Consider acupuncture, massage therapy, or yoga, which may help manage pain and stress.\n*   **Work with a Pharmacist:** Discuss your concerns about drug dependency with your pharmacist. They can help you understand the risks and benefits of your medications and suggest alternative pain management strategies.\n*   **Investigate Celiac Testing:** When your family doctor returns, prioritize testing for celiac disease. A definitive diagnosis will help you manage your diet and potentially reduce pain.\n*   **Look into Second-Line Gastroparesis Treatments:** If you are still experiencing issues from gastroparesis and you're only on Zofran, ask your doctors about other medication options like metoclopramide, domperidone, or erythromycin.\n\n**Long-Term Actions:**\n\n*   **Prepare for Surgery:** Continue working towards your hysterectomy and excision surgery. This is likely your best long-term solution for managing your pain and improving your quality of life.\n*   **Advocacy:** Consider joining an endometriosis advocacy group. Sharing your story and connecting with other patients can be empowering.\n*   **Mental Health Support:** Chronic pain can take a toll on your mental health. Consider seeing a therapist or counselor who specializes in chronic pain or women's health issues.\n*   **Patient Advocate:** Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you navigate the healthcare system and address concerns about your care. Consider speaking with one to share your experience.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Seizures:**\n\n*   **Stress and Pain:** As you mentioned, stress and pain can increase seizure risk. It's crucial to manage your stress levels and ensure your epilepsy is well-controlled.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Be sure to inform all your doctors and pharmacists about all the medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential drug interactions. Tylenol 3's and Toradol can interact with anti-epileptic medication and lower the seizure threshold.\n*   **Emergency Plan:** Make sure you have a seizure action plan and that your family and friends know what to do if you have a seizure.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n*   **You are not alone.** Many women experience dismissive and invalidating experiences with the healthcare system.\n*   **You are your best advocate.** Trust your instincts and continue to push for the care you deserve.\n*   **Your pain is real.** Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n*   **You deserve to live a pain-free and fulfilling life.**\n\nIt is essential to advocate for yourself and find healthcare professionals who listen to your concerns and take your pain seriously. I hope these steps can provide you with some guidance and support as you navigate this challenging situation. I wish you the very best.\n"

    "question": "Here\u2019s my info: 21F, 160lbs, 5\u20192\u201d, White; preexisting conditions include Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and Asthma; non drinker, but I do vape and smoke weed Current medications: Zoloft 100mg 1x/day AM, Adderall 10mg as needed for school/work, Fluticasone inhaler (Advair) 2x/day, Singulair 10mg 1x/day PM, Xyzal 5mg 1x/day PM, Ventolin inhaler as needed, Keppra 500mg 2x/day I made a post about this a few months ago. I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started. I\u2019m really just making a post to gather more insight and experiences from doctors and other people as well. If anyone has any insight as to what could be causing this, it would be much appreciated. This diagnosis has kinda knocked me on my ass, as I can\u2019t drive for 6 months after my last seizure. While I\u2019m glad my scans/tests were unremarkable, I wish I had gotten some sort of answer.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your frustration. Having a grand mal seizure with no clear cause, and continuing to experience partial seizures despite being on Keppra, is definitely unsettling. It's good that you're proactive in seeking information and understanding. Let's break down the situation and explore potential avenues for investigation.\n\n**What We Know:**\n\n*   **You've experienced both partial and grand mal seizures.** This indicates a likely underlying seizure disorder, even if the cause is currently unclear.\n*   **Your initial MRI and EEG were unremarkable.** While this is good in some ways, it's frustrating because it doesn't provide a direct explanation. Remember that a single normal EEG doesn't rule out epilepsy. EEGs are snapshots in time.\n*   **Seizures started relatively recently (mid/late 2019).** This *de novo* onset (new onset in adulthood) makes it less likely to be a purely genetic/inherited form of epilepsy.\n*   **No family history of epilepsy.**  This further strengthens the case that the cause is acquired, not inherited.\n*   **No known triggers like fever or new drugs.** This makes it more difficult to pinpoint an obvious cause.\n*   **You're on Keppra (Levetiracetam),** a common anti-seizure medication, but still experiencing partial seizures.\n*   **Other medications:** You're taking Zoloft, Adderall, Fluticasone, Singulair, Xyzal.\n\n**Potential Causes & Avenues for Investigation:**\n\nGiven the normal MRI and EEG, we need to consider causes that might not be easily detectable on those initial tests.  Since the onset is recent, focusing on acquired causes is paramount.\n\n1.  **Medication Interactions:**\n\n    *   **Adderall:** This is a stimulant and can, in some individuals, lower the seizure threshold. While you've been on it for a while, changes in stress levels, sleep, or other medications could alter its effect. It's crucial to discuss this with your prescribing doctor. Consider exploring non-stimulant options for managing ADHD symptoms if Adderall is suspected as a contributing factor.\n    *   **Zoloft (Sertraline):** While generally considered to have a lower risk than some other antidepressants, SSRIs like Zoloft can also, in rare cases, lower the seizure threshold.\n    *   **Combined Effects:** The interaction between Adderall and Zoloft is possible.\n    *   **Discuss ALL medications with your neurologist.** They need to consider the whole picture.\n\n2.  **Subtle Structural Abnormalities:**\n\n    *   **High-Resolution MRI with Epilepsy Protocol:** A standard MRI may miss subtle abnormalities. Ask your neurologist about a high-resolution MRI specifically designed for epilepsy diagnosis. This uses thinner slices and special sequences to better visualize the hippocampus and other areas often involved in seizures.\n    *   **Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM):** This is an MRI post-processing technique that can detect subtle differences in brain structure that might not be visible to the naked eye.\n\n3.  **Sleep Deprivation & Stress:**\n\n    *   These are common seizure triggers. Keeping a detailed seizure diary, noting sleep patterns, stress levels, and any potential triggers before each seizure, is crucial.  Try to establish a consistent sleep schedule and incorporate stress-reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n4.  **Hormonal Fluctuations:**\n\n    *   As a young woman, hormonal changes related to your menstrual cycle could potentially influence seizure activity. Track your menstrual cycle and see if there's any correlation with your seizure frequency.  Discuss this with your neurologist; some women with epilepsy find that adjusting their medication around their menstrual cycle can be helpful.\n\n5.  **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**\n\n    *   While less likely with a normal MRI, autoimmune encephalitis (where the immune system attacks the brain) can sometimes present with seizures. If your doctors are truly stumped, consider asking about testing for autoimmune antibodies in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtained via lumbar puncture (spinal tap). This is more invasive but could rule out this possibility.\n\n6.  **Drug Use:**\n\n    *   **Vaping and Weed:** While you've stated you haven't introduced any new drugs, consistent use of cannabis can sometimes, though rarely, be associated with seizures. The effects of vaping on seizure activity are less well-studied. While it may be difficult, consider temporarily ceasing the use of these for an extended period to determine if there is a decrease in seizures. I understand this may be difficult, and I am not trying to tell you to stop, but I do recommend bringing this up to your neurologist.\n\n7.  **Genetic Testing:**\n\n    *   Even without a family history, there are some *de novo* (new mutations) genetic causes of epilepsy. While less likely given the adult onset, it's something to consider if other investigations are negative.\n\n8.  **Repeat EEG \u2013 Consider Ambulatory or Video EEG:**\n\n    *   **Ambulatory EEG:** This involves wearing an EEG monitor for 24-72 hours (or even longer) at home. This increases the chances of capturing seizure activity that might be missed during a routine EEG.\n    *   **Video EEG Monitoring:** This is typically done in a hospital setting and involves continuous EEG recording along with video monitoring. This allows doctors to correlate your seizure events with the EEG activity. They may try to provoke a seizure by reducing medication or using other stimuli (e.g., flashing lights).\n\n9. **Metabolic Disorders:**\n\n*   Although less common, certain metabolic disorders that may not have been present in childhood could manifest in adulthood with seizures. Your neurologist may consider additional blood tests to screen for these.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Advocate for Further Investigation:** Don't settle for \"we don't know.\" Push for a high-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocol, consider ambulatory EEG or video EEG monitoring, and discuss the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis testing.\n\n2.  **Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Meticulously track your seizures, including the time of day, what you were doing beforehand, sleep quality, stress levels, menstrual cycle (if applicable), and any potential triggers. This diary will be invaluable to your neurologist.\n\n3.  **Medication Review:**  Have a thorough discussion with your neurologist AND the prescribing doctors about all your medications, including Adderall and Zoloft, and their potential impact on seizure threshold. Explore alternative medications if necessary.\n\n4.  **Lifestyle Modifications:** Prioritize sleep, stress management, and a healthy diet.\n\n5.  **Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting, consider seeking a second opinion from an epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy).\n\n6.  **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of all tests, results, and doctor's recommendations.\n\n7.  **Safety Precautions:**  Since you can't drive, focus on alternative transportation options.  Be aware of your surroundings and avoid situations where a seizure could put you at risk (e.g., swimming alone).\n\n8.  **Support Groups:** Connect with other people who have epilepsy. Sharing experiences and getting support can be incredibly helpful.  The Epilepsy Foundation is a good resource.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Keppra Dosage:** Are you tolerating the Keppra well?  Some people experience side effects like mood changes or fatigue. If you're having significant side effects, discuss this with your neurologist; there may be alternative anti-seizure medications to consider.\n*   **Compliance:** Be absolutely sure you are taking your Keppra exactly as prescribed. Missing doses can significantly increase the risk of seizures.\n*   **Breakthrough Seizures:** Experiencing seizures despite being on medication is not uncommon. Your neurologist may need to adjust your Keppra dosage or add another anti-seizure medication.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. They can properly evaluate your individual situation and provide tailored advice. Do not delay seeking medical advice because of something you have read online.\n"

    "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation, and your concerns are valid. Let's break down the key points and try to address your questions and anxieties:\n\n**1. Xifaxan (Rifaximin) and Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE):**\n\n*   **Purpose:** Xifaxan is a poorly absorbed antibiotic that reduces the number of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut. Ammonia is a neurotoxin, and in liver disease, it can build up in the bloodstream, cross the blood-brain barrier, and cause HE.\n*   **Symptoms of HE:** HE presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from subtle cognitive changes (like short-term memory loss, poor concentration, changes in personality, and impaired judgment) to more severe manifestations (such as confusion, disorientation, asterixis (\"liver flap\" \u2013 a flapping tremor of the hands), and ultimately coma). **While seizures are less common, they *can* be a symptom of HE, especially in more severe cases.**\n*   **Your Dad's Situation:** While your father performs well on cognitive tests, the fact that he has decreased insight, increased short-term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence suggests HE is, or has been, present. His self-assessment that he *doesn't* need Xifaxan may be influenced by the HE itself, as impaired judgment is a hallmark symptom.\n*   **The Link to Seizures:**  It is *possible* that going off Xifaxan contributed to the recent seizures. While not the most common presentation of HE, it is documented. Increasing ammonia levels due to the absence of Xifaxan could lower the seizure threshold in the brain.\n*   **Urinary Frequency:**  Xifaxan does not typically cause increased urinary frequency.  That side effect is most likely due to the Spiractin (spironolactone), a diuretic used to manage ascites (fluid buildup) that is common in cirrhosis.\n\n**2. Seizures in Liver Disease: Other Potential Causes and Considerations:**\n\n*   **HE:** As discussed above, this is a real possibility.\n*   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Liver disease can disrupt electrolyte balance (sodium, potassium, etc.). Hyponatremia (low sodium), which your father was treating with salt tablets, can cause seizures. It's good that he spoke to his GP and has stopped.\n*   **Alcohol Withdrawal:** Although he consumes a small number of beers each night, if he were to stop suddenly, it could trigger withdrawal seizures. This is less likely if he is consistently drinking.\n*   **Structural Brain Lesions:** The fMRI is crucial to rule out other causes, such as a tumor, stroke, or other brain abnormalities unrelated to his liver disease. It's wise that his doctor is being thorough. It also needs to be checked whether the accident in 1971 has left any scarring on the brain that has come to light.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** It's less likely, but the potential for interactions between his medications (Propranolol, Pantoprazole, Irbesartan, Spiractin, Mirtazapine, and now Keppra) should be considered.\n\n**3. Keppra (Levetiracetam):**\n\n*   **Common Antiepileptic:** Keppra is a commonly used anti-seizure medication. It's generally well-tolerated.\n*   **Monitoring:** His doctor will likely monitor his response to the medication and adjust the dosage as needed.\n\n**4. The Ethical Dilemma and Communication:**\n\n*   **Patient Autonomy:** You are correct; you cannot force your father to take medications against his will. This is a matter of patient autonomy.\n*   **Open Communication:** The best approach is to have open and honest conversations with him about the risks and benefits of Xifaxan and the dangers of seizures. Try to understand his concerns about Xifaxan, and see if there are alternative ways to manage the urinary frequency (if indeed it is the Spiractin causing the urinary frequency).\n*   **Involve His Medical Team:** Ideally, a doctor or nurse could have a frank discussion with him, emphasizing the importance of Xifaxan for cognitive function and potentially seizure control. Sometimes, hearing it from a medical professional carries more weight.\n*   **Quality of Life:** You've posed the question to him \u2013 seizures vs. frequent bathroom trips. He's clearly prioritizing his comfort in the short term. The challenge is to help him understand the long-term consequences of uncontrolled seizures.\n\n**5. Concerns About Deterioration:**\n\n*   **Your Concerns Are Valid:** Two seizures in quick succession are definitely cause for concern. They could indicate a worsening of his underlying liver disease, a new neurological problem, or an imbalance in electrolytes.\n*   **Progression of Liver Disease:** Cirrhosis is a progressive disease. Even with stable periods, complications can arise. The fMRI is essential to evaluate the progression.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Advocate for a Comprehensive Evaluation:** Ensure the fMRI is performed promptly and that all possible causes of the seizures are investigated, including electrolytes, other metabolic disturbances, and the structural brain lesions.\n2.  **Discuss Xifaxan Alternatives (Potentially):** If the urinary frequency is truly the main deterrent, explore if there are ways to adjust the Spiractin dosage (with his doctor's guidance) or manage the ascites in other ways. If it is caused by something else, perhaps something can be done to alleviate the frequent trips to the bathroom. While Xifaxan is the primary medication for HE, in some cases, other strategies can be considered, though they are usually less effective.\n3.  **Have a Frank Conversation:** Try to have a calm and rational discussion with your father about your concerns and the potential consequences of his choices. Focus on his overall well-being and quality of life.\n4.  **Involve His Medical Team:** Schedule a meeting with his doctor to discuss your concerns and see if they can help to educate your father about the importance of HE management.\n5.  **Advance Care Planning:** If your father is open to it, consider discussing his wishes for end-of-life care. This can be a difficult conversation, but it's important to ensure his wishes are respected.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** *This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "19F 167cm 59kg chinese in UK // \"passing out\" under certain conditions, suspected focal epilepsy?? duration: 3+ years?? (no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",

    "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a very concerning situation, and I understand your anxiety about it, especially given your upcoming travel. While I **cannot** provide a diagnosis (as I am an AI and not a medical professional), I can offer some potential areas to consider and strongly advise you to prioritize medical evaluation as soon as possible.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential considerations and some advice:\n\n**Why This Sounds Concerning:**\n\n*   **Frequency:** Passing out several times a month for three years is not normal and requires investigation.\n*   **Specific Triggers:** The fact that you have identifiable triggers (bright lights/screens in dim environments) is very important.\n*   **Recurrent Episodes:** The repeated passing out after regaining consciousness suggests a persistent triggering factor.\n*   **Lack of Explanation:** You need a proper diagnosis to understand what is going on.\n*   **Potential Danger:** Unconsciousness in certain situations (driving, stairs, etc.) can be dangerous.\n\n**Potential Causes (Things Your Doctor Might Consider):**\n\n*   **Photosensitive Epilepsy:** This is a type of epilepsy where seizures are triggered by flashing lights or patterns. This is definitely a possibility given your triggers, although it's important to remember that not everyone who is sensitive to light has epilepsy. You described your eyes rolling and refusing to focus, which is an indicator of an epilepsy.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope (Fainting):** This is a common cause of fainting, but it's typically triggered by things like stress, pain, or standing for long periods. While it can be triggered by visual stimuli in rare cases, the repeated episodes and specific light/environment relationship make it less likely as the sole explanation.\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up, which can cause dizziness and fainting. While less likely given your specific triggers, it's something to rule out.\n*   **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats can sometimes lead to fainting.\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** Some types of migraine can cause visual disturbances and even temporary loss of consciousness.\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are other, less common neurological conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n*   **Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES):** Seizures that look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  These are often related to psychological factors.\n\n**What You Need to Do (Prioritized):**\n\n1.  **MEDICAL EVALUATION IS ESSENTIAL:** I cannot stress this enough. You need to see a doctor (ideally a neurologist) as soon as possible after you return in October.\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Log:** Start meticulously recording every episode. Include:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   Specific environment (lighting, sounds, etc.)\n    *   What you were doing immediately before\n    *   Your sensations leading up to the episode (dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, etc.)\n    *   How long you were unconscious\n    *   What you remember from the episode itself\n    *   How you felt immediately after and in the hours following\n3.  **Avoid Triggers:** As best as possible, avoid situations that you know can trigger an episode. This might mean avoiding concerts, dim environments with bright screens, etc.  This is for your safety.\n4.  **Inform Someone Close To You:** Tell a close friend or family member about these episodes, especially if you're travelling. They should know what to look for and how to help you if you have an episode.\n5.  **Medical Documentation:** If you have *any* existing medical records (even if you don't think they're relevant), bring them with you to your appointment. This includes any past blood tests, scans, etc.\n6.  **Consider Travel Insurance:** Check your travel insurance policy to see what it covers in terms of medical care while you're away.\n7.  **Emergency Plan:** While travelling, have a plan in case you have an episode. This could include carrying a card explaining your condition and what to do, and having a designated person who knows what to do.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   What are the most likely causes of my symptoms?\n*   What tests do you recommend (EEG, MRI, blood tests, etc.)?\n*   Are there any immediate precautions I should take?\n*   What are the treatment options?\n*   Should I see a specialist (neurologist, cardiologist, etc.)?\n\n**Important Considerations for October Appointment:**\n\n*   **Don't Delay:** Book the appointment as soon as you can.\n*   **Be Prepared:** Bring your detailed log, medical records, and a list of questions.\n*   **Be Thorough:** Describe your symptoms accurately and completely. Don't minimize or exaggerate anything.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nYour symptoms warrant prompt medical attention. Photosensitive epilepsy is a definite consideration, but other conditions need to be ruled out. Prioritize seeing a doctor as soon as possible after you return in October. In the meantime, avoid your triggers, keep a detailed log, and inform someone close to you. This is for your safety and well-being.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Do not delay seeking medical advice based on anything you read here.\n"

    "question": "Male 6months old no medical conditions, no medicine being taken. Approx 20lbs healthy baby boyMy son was sleeping and woke up screaming I went to soothe him and he couldn\u2019t be consoled for what seemed like forever. I tried waking him up from what seemed like a nightmare but he wouldn\u2019t wake finally he woke up and stopped screaming. He became unresponsive but with eyes open. He looked lethargic and wouldn\u2019t respond to stimulation. Then shook a little bit 3 times and went back to normal. Was this a seizure? Should I take him to the hospital or have his doctor look into it at his physical?Thank you for any responseUpdate: baby went to the doctor today they will be doing an EEG to be on the safe side.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your description, **yes, what you observed could very well have been a seizure**, even though it's impossible to say definitively without medical evaluation. The combination of inconsolable screaming followed by unresponsiveness with open eyes, lethargy, and shaking is concerning and warrants prompt medical attention.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why it's concerning and what you should do:**\n\n*   **Screaming before:** Sometimes, though not always, seizures can be preceded by distress or changes in behavior. The screaming you described before the event could be related.\n*   **Unresponsiveness with Open Eyes:** This is not a typical reaction to waking from a nightmare. While babies can be groggy, they should generally respond to your voice or touch.\n*   **Lethargy:** The post-event lethargy is also concerning. Seizures often leave individuals feeling tired and confused afterward (the \"postictal\" state).\n*   **Shaking/Jerking:** The three shakes are particularly suggestive of seizure activity, although other things can cause shaking, seizure is definitely high on the suspicion list.\n*   **Went Back to Normal:** The fact that he eventually went back to normal does NOT negate the need for evaluation. Seizures can be brief and isolated events.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\nYour update is great that he was seen and an EEG was scheduled. Given his age and the nature of what you saw, proceeding with the EEG is very important, so it's good the doctor is taking it seriously.\n\n**What the Doctor will consider:**\n\nWhen you see the doctor, they will want to rule out many things by going over the history and physical exam, and potentially the EEG.\n\n*   **History:** The doctor will ask you detailed questions about the event.\n*   **Physical Exam:** A thorough neurological exam will be performed to look for any abnormalities.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** The doctor will consider other possibilities like:\n    *   **Breath-holding spell:** These can sometimes be mistaken for seizures, but are often triggered by crying or pain.\n    *   **Migraine:** Sometimes migraines can present with neurological symptoms, even in infants.\n    *   **Cardiac arrhythmia:** Rarely, an irregular heartbeat can cause a brief loss of consciousness.\n    *   **Other rare neurological conditions.**\n\nIt is possible that the EEG will not show any abnormalities, but in babies it can still happen and they will still seizure. Make sure to mention this to the doctor.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Video Recording:** If he has another episode, try to video record it. This can be invaluable for the doctor to see exactly what is happening.\n\nI am an AI and cannot give medical advice.\n"

    "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

    "answer": "Thanks for reaching out and sharing your story. It sounds incredibly frustrating and disruptive to your life. Let's break down the situation and consider some potential next steps.  It is important to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you need to discuss this information with your doctor to come up with the best plan for you.\n\n**Key Takeaways From Your Situation:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Diagnosis:** You have a history of epilepsy, controlled well by oxcarbazepine initially.\n*   **Medication Discontinuation:** Stopping the medication led to recurrence of symptoms.\n*   **Antibiotic Trigger:**  The H. pylori treatment (antibiotics and Prilosec) appears to have significantly worsened your symptoms and may have altered your response to oxcarbazepine.  The Prilosec can affect the absorption of medications and also change the gut microbiome.\n*   **Dietary Influence:**  Keto diet helps manage symptoms, but not entirely eliminating them.\n*   **Current Impairment:**  The current state is significantly impacting your quality of life, affecting your ability to work, socialize, and live independently.\n*   **Oxcarbazepine Ineffectiveness:**  The original medication is no longer effective, which is a crucial point.\n*   **Fear and Anxiety:**  Underlying anxiety surrounding potential seizures and symptoms is significantly impacting your behavior and limiting your activities.\n\n**Possible Courses of Action (Discuss with Your Neurologist!):**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the Diagnosis:**\n\n    *   **Is it *definitely* epilepsy?**  It's worth revisiting this, particularly because the initial medication stopped working.  Other conditions can mimic seizures (e.g., psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), movement disorders, migraine variants).\n    *   **Consider Video EEG:** A prolonged video EEG (electroencephalogram) while you are experiencing these sensations could be helpful. This would record your brain activity during an event and help confirm if it's epileptic activity. If the EEG is normal during an event, it could point to another diagnosis.\n\n2.  **Explore Alternative Anti-Epileptic Medications (AEDs):**\n\n    *   **Don't give up on medication entirely!**  Since oxcarbazepine is no longer effective, trying other AEDs is a reasonable and important step. There are many options, and it may take some trial and error to find one that works well for you with minimal side effects.  Common options include:\n        *   **Levetiracetam (Keppra):** A commonly used AED.\n        *   **Lamotrigine (Lamictal):** Can be very effective, especially for certain seizure types.\n        *   **Topiramate (Topamax):**  Can also help with migraines if that's a factor.\n        *   **Zonisamide (Zonegran):** Another option to consider.\n    *   **Genetic Testing:** In some cases, genetic testing can help predict how you might respond to certain AEDs and identify potential side effects.\n    *   **Titration and Monitoring:** Any new AED needs to be started at a low dose and gradually increased (titrated) while carefully monitoring for side effects and seizure control.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Role of Gut Health:**\n\n    *   **Gut Microbiome Testing:** The antibiotics likely disrupted your gut microbiome, and this could be contributing to your symptoms.  Consider getting a comprehensive stool test to analyze your gut bacteria.\n    *   **Probiotics and Diet:**  Work with a registered dietitian or nutritionist experienced in gut health to develop a plan to restore a healthy gut microbiome. This might include specific strains of probiotics and a diet rich in prebiotics (foods that feed beneficial bacteria).\n    *   **Consider Consulting a Gastroenterologist:**  Especially given the recurring acid reflux. They can investigate further and rule out other gastrointestinal issues.\n    *   **Note:** The connection between gut health and epilepsy is an area of ongoing research, but there's increasing evidence of a link between the gut microbiome and brain function.\n\n4.  **Address Acid Reflux:**\n\n    *   **Medication Alternatives to Prilosec:** Discuss with your doctor about alternative medications for acid reflux, as Prilosec might be affecting the absorption of other medications. H2 blockers (like famotidine) or other options might be better.\n    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Continue to focus on lifestyle changes to manage acid reflux, such as avoiding trigger foods (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods), eating smaller meals, not eating before bed, and elevating the head of your bed.\n\n5.  **Manage Stress and Anxiety:**\n\n    *   **Therapy:**  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be incredibly helpful in managing anxiety and fear related to your condition. It can help you develop coping strategies for dealing with unexpected symptoms and reduce anticipatory anxiety.\n    *   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help reduce overall stress levels and improve your ability to manage symptoms.\n\n6.  **Neuromodulation Techniques (Consider if Medications Aren't Sufficient):**\n\n    *   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):**  A device implanted that stimulates the vagus nerve, which can help reduce seizure frequency in some people.\n    *   **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):**  A device that monitors brain activity and delivers brief electrical stimulation to stop seizures as they begin.\n\n7.  **Dietary Considerations:**\n\n    *   **Keto Diet:**  While helpful, the keto diet can be difficult to maintain long-term and might not be a complete solution. Work with a registered dietitian to ensure you're getting adequate nutrition and to explore variations of the keto diet that might be more sustainable.\n    *   **Explore Other Dietary Approaches:**  A modified Atkins diet or a low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) may also be helpful and easier to maintain than a strict keto diet.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   \"Could my symptoms be something other than epilepsy?\"\n*   \"What other AEDs are appropriate for my type of seizures?\"\n*   \"How can we determine the best AED for me with the fewest side effects?\"\n*   \"Could the antibiotics/Prilosec have affected my response to oxcarbazepine or triggered my symptoms?\"\n*   \"Would a video EEG be helpful in clarifying my diagnosis?\"\n*   \"Are there any clinical trials I might be eligible for?\"\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYour situation is complex, and it sounds like you need a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. Don't give up hope! It's highly likely that you can find a way to better manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. The key is to work closely with your neurologist and other healthcare professionals to explore all available options.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find some relief soon!\n"

    "question": "I took my epilepsy meds about 1.5h ago, Divalproex Sodium 250mg. I want to take a regular Gravol (not nighttime) so I can get to sleep earlier. I know it's not the best sleep aid but I don't have anything else at home currently and I want to fix my awful schedule.I read something about diphenhydramine triggering seizures but I'm not sure how similar it is to dimenhydrinate which is in Gravol so I'm a little worried as I haven't had one in years.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about potential interactions between your epilepsy medication (Divalproex Sodium) and Gravol (dimenhydrinate), especially given your history of seizures. Mixing medications, even over-the-counter ones, can be risky, and it's always best to err on the side of caution.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the situation and why consulting a healthcare professional is the most appropriate course of action:\n\n*   **Divalproex Sodium (Depakote):** This is a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraine headaches. It works by affecting certain chemicals in the brain.\n*   **Dimenhydrinate (Gravol):** This is an antihistamine used to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness. It works by affecting the inner ear and brain.\n\n**Potential Interactions and Concerns:**\n\n*   **Diphenhydramine vs. Dimenhydrinate:** Diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate are related, as dimenhydrinate contains diphenhydramine. So concerns about diphenhydramine and seizures would also apply to dimenhydrinate.\n*   **Seizure Threshold:** Some antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, have been reported to potentially lower the seizure threshold in some individuals. This means they could make seizures more likely to occur, especially in people with epilepsy or a history of seizures. This is the main concern.\n*   **Additive Sedation:** Both Divalproex Sodium and dimenhydrinate can cause drowsiness. Taking them together could increase this effect, leading to excessive sedation, dizziness, and impaired coordination.\n*   **Individual Variability:** Everyone reacts differently to medications. What might be safe for one person could be problematic for another. Your individual medical history, seizure control, and other factors play a role.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n**Do not take the Gravol without consulting a healthcare professional first.** Call your doctor or pharmacist.\nThey can assess your specific situation, consider your medical history and medication regimen, and provide personalized advice on whether it's safe for you to take Gravol in combination with your Divalproex Sodium. They may also suggest alternative sleep aids that are less likely to interact with your epilepsy medication.\n\n**Important Information:**\n\n*   **Never stop taking your epilepsy medication without your doctor's guidance.** Suddenly stopping Divalproex Sodium can increase your risk of seizures.\n*   **Keep a record of all medications and supplements you take,** including over-the-counter drugs. Share this list with your healthcare providers.\n*   **If you experience any unusual symptoms after taking a new medication,** such as increased drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, or seizures, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any questions you may have regarding your health or medications.*"

    "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your recent surgeries, current medications, and the timing of the rash development in areas where IVs were placed, here's a breakdown of potential causes and how to proceed:\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\n*   **Contact Dermatitis:** This is the most likely scenario. It's a localized skin reaction caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. Common culprits related to IVs include:\n    *   **Adhesive bandages:** The adhesive used to secure the IV catheter can cause a reaction.\n    *   **Antiseptic solutions:** Solutions like chlorhexidine or iodine used to clean the skin before IV insertion can cause irritation or allergy.\n    *   **Latex:**  While less common now, some medical supplies contain latex.\n    *   **IV Catheter Material:** Rarely, a reaction to the catheter material itself.\n*   **IV Infiltration:**  If the IV fluid leaked outside the vein into the surrounding tissue, it can cause localized irritation and swelling. This *usually* presents more as swelling and discomfort than a distinct rash, but it's worth considering.\n*   **Phlebitis:** Inflammation of the vein. This usually involves pain, redness, and hardness along the vein's course.  It's less likely to cause a distinct, localized rash right at the insertion site, but could contribute to the overall irritation.\n*   **Allergic Reaction (Less Likely):**  A true allergic reaction to the IV fluid itself (or a medication administered through the IV) is possible, but less likely given the localized nature of the rash.  A systemic allergic reaction would usually involve more widespread symptoms like hives, itching all over, swelling of the face/lips/tongue, and/or difficulty breathing. Since the itching is only located in the location of the IV\u2019s it\u2019s unlikely that it\u2019s an allergic reaction to the iv fluid/medications.\n\n**Should You Be Worried?**\n\nGenerally, localized itching and a mild rash after IV placement are not immediately dangerous. However, because you are taking medication for epilepsy and you recently had surgery it is important to keep your medical team in the loop of any changes or symptoms that you may have.\n\n**Home/Over-the-Counter Remedies to Try:**\n\n1.  **Stop Potential Irritants:**\n    *   Avoid scratching the rash, as this can worsen irritation and increase the risk of infection.\n    *   Ensure the area is clean and dry.\n    *   Avoid using scented soaps or lotions on the affected areas.\n\n2.  **Topical Treatments:**\n    *   **Hydrocortisone Cream:**  A low-potency (1%) hydrocortisone cream applied 2-3 times daily can help reduce inflammation and itching. This is available over-the-counter. Apply a thin layer only to the affected area.\n    *   **Calamine Lotion:** Can help relieve itching and dryness.\n    *   **Cool Compresses:** Applying cool, wet compresses to the area for 15-20 minutes several times a day can help soothe the itching.\n\n3.  **Oral Antihistamine (Optional):**\n    *   If the itching is severe, an over-the-counter antihistamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin) *could* help. *However*, **discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist first**, especially given your epilepsy and current medications. Diphenhydramine can sometimes have interactions or side effects that are problematic. Loratadine is generally less sedating.\n\n**When to Contact Your Doctor (Important):**\n\n*   **Worsening Symptoms:** If the rash spreads, becomes more painful, develops blisters, or shows signs of infection (increased redness, warmth, pus), contact your doctor *immediately*.\n*   **Fever:** A fever is a sign of potential infection and warrants prompt medical attention.\n*   **Severe Itching:** If the itching is unbearable despite home treatments.\n*   **Signs of Systemic Allergic Reaction:** If you experience any of the following, go to the emergency room immediately:\n    *   Hives (all over the body)\n    *   Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat\n    *   Difficulty breathing\n    *   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Try the home remedies above for 24-48 hours.** If there's no improvement or the rash worsens, call your doctor.\n2.  **Contact your surgeon's office** to let them know about the rash. They'll want to know about any potential complications after surgery.  They can also advise on whether this is related to any medications you received during surgery.\n3.  **Talk to your pharmacist.** They can review your current medications (including the ones you were given in the hospital) and advise on potential interactions or allergies.\n\n**Important Considerations Given Your Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Medication Interactions:** It's crucial to rule out any potential interactions between the rash treatment (especially oral antihistamines) and your epilepsy medication.\n*   **Stress and Seizures:**  Stress can sometimes trigger seizures. Try to stay calm and relaxed, and don't hesitate to reach out to your support system if you're feeling anxious.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the cause of the rash, manage your symptoms, and ensure you receive appropriate medical care if needed. Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon!\n"

    "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your mother, especially given her history and your medical background. It sounds like you're approaching this thoughtfully and responsibly. Let's break down the situation and address your questions.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\nYou're describing a complex presentation with several contributing factors:\n\n*   **Post-Surgical Cognitive Impairment:** Pre-existing cognitive issues following surgery complicate the picture. Anesthesia, the surgery itself, and recovery can sometimes leave lasting cognitive effects, especially if there were complications.\n*   **Depressive Disorder:** Depression is a well-known \"mimicker\" of dementia. It can significantly impact memory, concentration, processing speed, and executive function. This is crucial to consider, as treating the depression might improve cognitive function.\n*   **New Cognitive Changes:** The recent difficulties in transmitting information (expressive language challenges) and feeling overwhelmed with tasks are concerning and warrant further investigation. These could be related to progression of the initial cognitive impairment, the depression, or an evolving underlying neurological process.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis (Without Imaging/Labs)**\n\nWhile imaging and lab tests are crucial for ruling out specific causes, it *is* possible to start forming a differential diagnosis based on clinical observations and cognitive testing. Here are some possibilities to consider:\n\n1.  **Depression-Related Cognitive Impairment (Pseudodementia):** This is a critical first consideration. The cognitive deficits are primarily driven by the mood disorder.\n\n    *   *Key Features:* Cognitive impairment fluctuates with mood; patient is often aware of and distressed by their cognitive difficulties; may report \"I don't know\" frequently; effortful responding during cognitive testing; good performance on recognition memory tasks.\n2.  **Alzheimer's Disease (AD):** While early-onset AD is less common without a family history, it's still possible.\n\n    *   *Key Features:* Gradual onset and progression of memory loss (especially new learning); visuospatial difficulties; executive dysfunction; language problems (often naming difficulties in early stages, but can progress to expressive language issues); personality changes may occur.\n3.  **Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI):** Given the history of surgery, consider potential vascular insults, even if subtle.\n\n    *   *Key Features:* Stepwise decline; focal neurological signs (even subtle); executive dysfunction; slowed processing speed; memory deficits may be more related to retrieval than encoding; history of vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) is suggestive, but the surgery could have indirectly caused vascular changes.\n4.  **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD):** While less likely without more behavioral changes, it's important to keep it on the list, especially if expressive language difficulties are prominent.\n\n    *   *Key Features:* Two main variants - behavioral and language. Behavioral variant includes disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, changes in diet. Language variants (primary progressive aphasia) can manifest as difficulties with word finding, grammar, or comprehension.\n5.  **Lewy Body Dementia (LBD):**\n\n    *   *Key Features:* Fluctuating cognition; visual hallucinations; parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia); REM sleep behavior disorder; sensitivity to neuroleptic medications. The expressive language difficulty is less typical in the early stages.\n6.  **Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA):** A type of frontotemporal dementia that primarily affects language abilities. There are three main variants:\n    *   **Nonfluent/agrammatic PPA:** Characterized by effortful, halting speech with grammatical errors.\n    *   **Semantic PPA:** Characterized by difficulties understanding the meaning of words.\n    *   **Logopenic PPA:** Characterized by difficulties with word retrieval and sentence repetition.\n7.  **Cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury.**\n8.  **Medication-Induced Cognitive Impairment:** Always review all medications (including over-the-counter) for potential cognitive side effects.\n\n**The Role of the MMSE and Clock Test**\n\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) are useful screening tools, but they have limitations:\n\n*   **MMSE:**\n    *   *Strengths:* Quick, widely used, assesses multiple cognitive domains (orientation, memory, attention, language, visuospatial skills). Provides a general overview of cognitive function.\n    *   *Weaknesses:* Relatively insensitive to *mild* cognitive impairment, especially in highly educated individuals. Affected by education level and cultural background. Not specific to any particular dementia type.\n*   **Clock Drawing Test:**\n    *   *Strengths:* Quick, sensitive to visuospatial and executive dysfunction. Can detect early cognitive impairment.\n    *   *Weaknesses:* Performance can be affected by vision problems, motor skills, and education. Not specific to any particular dementia type.\n\n**In summary, MMSE and clock drawing are helpful initial screening tools but should not be used in isolation for diagnosis. Their main role is to flag potential cognitive problems that warrant more in-depth evaluation.**\n\n**Next Steps (Suggestions for a Family Member)**\n\n1.  **Share Your Concerns with Your Mother's Psychiatrist:** It's crucial that the psychiatrist is aware of the new cognitive changes you've observed. They may want to adjust her medication or refer her for further neurological evaluation.\n2.  **Advocate for Comprehensive Neuropsychological Testing:** A detailed neuropsychological assessment is essential to identify specific cognitive strengths and weaknesses, track changes over time, and help differentiate between various potential diagnoses. This testing goes far beyond the MMSE.\n3.  **Consult a Neurologist:** A neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders can perform a thorough neurological examination, order appropriate imaging (MRI, CT scan, PET scan), and rule out other neurological conditions.\n4.  **Maintain a Detailed Log:** Keep a daily log of specific examples of your mother's cognitive difficulties. This will be incredibly helpful for the healthcare team. Note *when* these difficulties occur, *what* triggered them, and *how* they affect her daily life.\n5.  **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the initial evaluation, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another specialist.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Jump to Conclusions:** It's tempting to try to diagnose your mother yourself, but it's crucial to remain objective and avoid making premature judgments. Let the medical professionals guide the diagnostic process.\n*   **Focus on Support:** Regardless of the diagnosis, your mother needs your support and understanding. Focus on creating a safe and supportive environment that helps her maintain her independence and quality of life.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nYour concern is valid, and your observations are valuable. The information you provided suggests a complex situation that requires a thorough and multidisciplinary evaluation. Advocate for your mother to receive the appropriate assessments and follow-up care. The information above is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Consulting a professional is necessary to address your individual concerns.\n"

    "question": "Hi I recently had blood work done (a week ago) and my levels were high. 36yr female, I take 300mg daily of lamictal for epilepsy.Hemoglobin: 16.4 H Red blood cell count: 5.22 H Hematocrit: 47.8 H Some things I've noticed in the last 2-3 months, not sure if they are symptoms, but they have been happening enough and are different enough that I've noticed them. - night sweats, sometimes the shirt I sleep in will be wet, and it wakes me up - itchiness after hot baths or showers - fatigue (I had low vitamin D, so not sure if it's necessarily related to red blood cell count, vitamin D, or just general tiredness, i haven't been sleeping well for the past few months)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down these results and symptoms. It's important to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. You absolutely need to discuss these results and your symptoms with your doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. This information is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n**Understanding Your Blood Work Results**\n\n*   **Hemoglobin (Hgb): 16.4 g/dL (High)**: Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A high level could indicate your body is producing too many red blood cells.  Normal ranges vary slightly between labs, but generally, for women, it's around 12.0-15.5 g/dL.\n*   **Red Blood Cell Count (RBC): 5.22 million/mcL (High)**: This is the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood.  Again, high values suggest overproduction. Normal ranges for women are generally around 4.2-5.4 million/mcL.\n*   **Hematocrit (Hct): 47.8% (High)**: Hematocrit is the percentage of your blood volume that is made up of red blood cells.  High levels corroborate the other two high values.  Normal ranges for women are usually around 37-47%.\n\n**Collectively, these three high values point towards a possible condition called erythrocytosis or polycythemia, which is an increase in red blood cell mass.**\n\n**Possible Causes of Elevated Red Blood Cell Values**\n\nThere are many possible reasons for elevated red blood cell values. Some common causes include:\n\n*   **Dehydration:** This is a relatively common cause. If you're dehydrated, the concentration of red blood cells in your blood appears higher because there's less fluid volume.\n*   **Smoking:** Smoking can stimulate red blood cell production.\n*   **High Altitude:** Living at a high altitude can lead to increased red blood cell production to compensate for lower oxygen levels.\n*   **Lung Disease (e.g., COPD, Sleep Apnea):** Conditions that reduce oxygen levels in the blood can trigger increased red blood cell production.\n*   **Kidney Disease:** The kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates red blood cell production. Certain kidney conditions can lead to overproduction of EPO.\n*   **Polycythemia Vera:** This is a rare bone marrow disorder that causes the body to produce too many red blood cells. It's a more serious condition.\n*   **Medications:** In rare cases, certain medications can increase red blood cell production.\n*   **Tumors:** Certain tumors can produce erythropoietin.\n\n**Connecting Your Symptoms to the Blood Work**\n\n*   **Night Sweats:**  Night sweats can be a symptom of various conditions, including infections, hormone imbalances, certain cancers (like lymphoma), and some medications.  In the context of potentially elevated red blood cell production, it could potentially be linked to polycythemia vera or other myeloproliferative disorders (although other causes are more likely).\n*   **Itchiness After Hot Baths/Showers (Aquagenic Pruritus):** This is a classic symptom associated with polycythemia vera, although it can occur in other conditions as well. It's thought to be related to histamine release.\n*   **Fatigue:**  Fatigue can be caused by many things, including low vitamin D, poor sleep, underlying medical conditions, and even the stress of dealing with health concerns. While less specific, it can also be related to high red blood cell counts, as the increased blood viscosity can affect oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\n**Lamictal and Blood Counts**\n\nLamictal (lamotrigine) is not typically associated with causing significant changes in red blood cell counts. While it can have side effects, erythrocytosis is not a common one. However, it's always important to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking.\n\n**What You Need to Do**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Doctor Immediately:**  Schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your blood work results and symptoms.  Do not wait.\n2.  **Be Prepared to Provide Information:**  Be ready to give your doctor a thorough medical history, including:\n    *   All medications you're taking (including Lamictal and any supplements).\n    *   Any other health conditions you have.\n    *   Your lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise).\n    *   Your family history of blood disorders.\n    *   Whether you live at a high altitude.\n3.  **Possible Next Steps:** Your doctor will likely order further testing to determine the cause of the elevated red blood cell counts.  This may include:\n    *   **Repeat Blood Work:** To confirm the initial results.\n    *   **Erythropoietin (EPO) Level:** To assess kidney function and EPO production.\n    *   **JAK2 Mutation Testing:** This is a genetic test used to help diagnose polycythemia vera.\n    *   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** In some cases, a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to examine the bone marrow cells.\n    *   **Pulmonary Function Tests:** To assess for underlying lung disease.\n4.  **Follow Your Doctor's Instructions:**  Adhere to any recommendations your doctor makes regarding further testing, treatment, or lifestyle changes.\n\n**In summary, the combination of your elevated red blood cell counts and symptoms like night sweats and aquagenic pruritus warrants prompt medical evaluation.  Do not try to self-diagnose or treat yourself. See your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.**\n"

    "question": "36F 145 pounds 5'8 Started having issues with everything in my early to mid20s I'll list everything just in caseDIAGNOSED: Epilepsy - diagnosed in 2007 Narcolepsy with Cataplexy - diagnosed in 2009 Raynaud's with Erythermalagia - diagnosed 2016Other symptoms: Pins and needles in stomach, face, eyes, extremities, head -not all at once -this can occur at random times -sometimes while I work out, having sex (which can also cause my fingers or lips to stiffen and I have to wait for them to work itself out) sitting on the toilet, or laying down (which only happens to my stomach) Every blue moon, I'll have muscle spasms feeling like they are steming from my spine after I've laid down. It feels more neurological, if that makes sense.My body will feel like it's shaking on the inside, almost like it's vibrating. Usually when I'm tired.I have urge incontinence probably due to years of battling constipation. Must admit, I think it's getting better as it's not as frequently happening as it was.My left nostril will drip or run snot sometimes without me even realizing it (newer symptom) My primary doctor said it's probably just post nasal drip and prescribed me nasal spray twice a day. It does help dry it out but if I miss even one time, my husband will point out it running down.Recently switched neurologist and had a EEG done which I had an episode though it showed on the test and the nurse helped me through it, it registered as not a seizure or he said it didn't convince him that it was though the nurse clearly saw it.  At times when I'm feeling off I'm rushed with rapid heart beat, shakiness, and I can't read (everything looks to be in another language). At this point I feel confused, scared, angry, and rushed. Happens a lot when I have decisions to make. Restaurants, retail store, airport, etc.I get brain fog a lot but as long as I take my nuvigil I do a lot better.Here's why I'm posting... I can hear everything while having an episode, though sometimes when I repeat back what was happening while I have a seizure it's not all the way correct. I can't talk during it. My eyes roll back. The last one I shook some, which doesn't usually happens. I've had times where my hands cripple up (rarely). I usually feel a \"drooping\" or pulling in my bottom lip when things start and a complete lack of ability to use my muscles. They feel really heavy. I tend to stare right beforehand. The second to last episode I felt a pulling sensation, like someone was turning my head towards the left. When it ended, I head was facing left.My neurologist is putting me on Vimpat. I was taking Xyrem for ten years but last year I switched to ambien because my snoring got really bad.Current medication: Ambien 5mg Nuvigil 250mg I have an IUD I'll be starting Vimpat 100mgWasn't very active in my 20's Started working out in my 30's Past year in a half I have focused on strength training and cardio 5-6 times a week.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, that's a lot of information, and it sounds like you've been dealing with a complex and frustrating array of symptoms for a long time. Let's break it down and try to think about possible connections and avenues to explore.\n\n**Summary of Your Symptoms & Diagnoses:**\n\n*   **Diagnosed Conditions:**\n    *   Epilepsy (diagnosed 2007)\n    *   Narcolepsy with Cataplexy (diagnosed 2009)\n    *   Raynaud's with Erythermalgia (diagnosed 2016)\n*   **Key Symptoms:**\n    *   \"Episodes\" with inability to speak, eyes rolling back, sometimes shaking, sometimes hand cramping, lip drooping/pulling, staring, head turning. You are aware of surroundings but may not recall accurately.\n    *   Pins and needles sensations (stomach, face, eyes, extremities, head) - random, triggered by various activities (exercise, sex, bathroom, lying down).\n    *   Muscle spasms from spine (rare)\n    *   Internal shaking/vibrating (especially when tired)\n    *   Urge incontinence\n    *   Unilateral runny nose (left nostril)\n    *   Rapid heart rate, shakiness, inability to read (visual processing difficulty), confusion, anxiety, especially in situations requiring decisions.\n    *   Brain fog (improved with Nuvigil)\n*   **Medications:**\n    *   Ambien 5mg (replaces Xyrem for Narcolepsy)\n    *   Nuvigil 250mg\n    *   IUD\n    *   Starting Vimpat 100mg\n\n**Possible Considerations and Questions:**\n\n1.  **Epilepsy vs. Cataplexy vs. Other Events:** This is the most critical area to clarify. You mention \"episodes\" that resemble seizures, but your recent EEG was inconclusive despite an event occurring during the test. It's essential to determine:\n    *   **Are these events seizures?**  The neurologist is clearly uncertain.  Vimpat is an appropriate medication for epilepsy, but only if the episodes *are* seizures.\n    *   **Could these episodes be severe cataplexy?**  Cataplexy can involve muscle weakness, even collapse, often triggered by strong emotions. Your description of muscle weakness, lip drooping, and the head-turning episode could potentially align with this.  However, the eye-rolling and shaking are less typical of cataplexy alone.\n    *   **Could these episodes be a combination?** It's possible to have both seizures and cataplexy.\n    *   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)?** This is a condition where episodes look like seizures but are not caused by abnormal brain electrical activity.  Stress, anxiety, and past trauma can be factors.  It's important to consider this possibility if the EEG consistently shows no seizure activity.\n    *   **Cardiac Issues?** Rapid heart rate, shakiness, and confusion can be symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac issues. It's worth considering, especially given the autonomic issues suggested by Raynaud's.\n\n2.  **Raynaud's and Erythermalgia:** This indicates an issue with blood vessel regulation.  Raynaud's causes reduced blood flow (cold, pale fingers/toes), while Erythermalgia causes increased blood flow (red, burning). These are related but opposite problems.\n    *   **Underlying Autoimmune or Connective Tissue Disease?**  Raynaud's can be primary (on its own) or secondary to an underlying condition like lupus, scleroderma, or rheumatoid arthritis.  Have you been screened for these?\n    *   **Medication Side Effects?** Some medications can worsen Raynaud's or Erythermalgia.\n    *   **Link to Other Symptoms?** Blood vessel dysfunction can potentially contribute to other symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or even neurological symptoms in rare cases.\n\n3.  **Pins and Needles (Paresthesias):** The random and widespread nature of these sensations is concerning.\n    *   **Neuropathy?** Damage to peripheral nerves can cause pins and needles, numbness, or pain. Causes include diabetes, vitamin deficiencies (B12, etc.), toxins, infections, autoimmune diseases, and medications.\n    *   **Small Fiber Neuropathy?** This is a specific type of neuropathy that affects small nerve fibers, and can cause burning pain, pins and needles, and autonomic symptoms.\n    *   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?**  MS can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including sensory disturbances like pins and needles.  This would be a less likely consideration since your symptoms have been ongoing for so long without significant progression, but it's not unreasonable to at least consider.\n    *   **Fibromyalgia?** While fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion, it can cause widespread pain, fatigue, and sensory disturbances.\n\n4.  **Runny Nose (Left Nostril):**\n    *   **CSF Leak?** Although unlikely, a unilateral clear nasal discharge should raise the question of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, especially if it's clear and watery. Your doctor should have considered this.  There are tests to check for CSF in the nasal fluid. (Beta-2 Transferrin test)\n\n5.  **Urge Incontinence and Constipation:**\n    *   **Neurological Involvement?** These bowel and bladder symptoms can be caused by neurological problems, particularly those affecting the spinal cord or autonomic nervous system.  It's important to consider this in the context of your other symptoms.\n\n6.  **Brain Fog, Cognitive Issues, Anxiety:**\n    *   **Medication Side Effects?** Ambien and Nuvigil can both have cognitive side effects.  Ambien can sometimes cause confusion, and Nuvigil, while intended to improve alertness, can sometimes cause anxiety or agitation.\n    *   **Sleep Quality?** Even with medication, are you getting truly restful sleep?  Sleep apnea or other sleep disorders can contribute to brain fog.\n    *   **Depression/Anxiety?** These can significantly impact cognitive function.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Episode Log:** Keep a very detailed log of your \"episodes.\" Include:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   What you were doing immediately before\n    *   What you felt leading up to the episode (triggers, auras)\n    *   Specific symptoms during the episode (inability to speak, eye rolling, muscle weakness, etc.)\n    *   What you remember afterward\n    *   How long the episode lasted\n    *   What you felt like afterward\n    *   Medication timings on that day\n    *   Stress Levels\n2.  **Video Recording:** If possible, have someone video record an episode. This can be incredibly helpful for your neurologist to see what's happening.\n3.  **Second Opinion (Neurology):** Given the uncertainty surrounding your diagnosis, a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and/or movement disorders is strongly recommended.  Ideally, someone with experience in differentiating seizures from other paroxysmal events like cataplexy.\n4.  **Further Neurological Testing:**\n    *   **Prolonged EEG Monitoring:**  Consider ambulatory EEG monitoring (continuous recording over several days) to increase the chance of capturing an event.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain with and without Contrast:**  To rule out structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Spinal Cord MRI:** Consider this if you have concerning symptoms that could be related to a Spinal Cord problem.\n5.  **Autoimmune/Connective Tissue Disease Screening:** Discuss with your doctor whether blood tests for autoimmune markers (ANA, rheumatoid factor, etc.) are warranted, given your Raynaud's and other symptoms.\n6.  **Sleep Study:** If not already done, a sleep study is important to rule out other sleep disorders that could be contributing to your fatigue and cognitive issues.\n7.  **Cardiology Evaluation:** Discuss your rapid heart rate, shakiness, and anxiety with your primary care physician. An EKG or other cardiac testing may be warranted.\n8.  **ENT Evaluation:** A consult with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist is recommended to investigate the unilateral runny nose, especially to rule out a CSF leak.\n9.  **Consider Tapering/Adjusting Medications (Carefully):** Discuss with your doctor whether your current medications (Ambien, Nuvigil) could be contributing to any of your symptoms. It may be necessary to carefully adjust dosages or try alternative medications.\n10. **Address constipation:** The gut-brain connection is very real, and ongoing constipation and urinary symptoms can be a sign of nerve problems.\n\n**Important Considerations About Starting Vimpat:**\n\n*   **Weigh the Risks and Benefits:** Because of the uncertainty about whether your episodes are actually seizures, carefully weigh the potential benefits of Vimpat against its potential side effects with your neurologist.\n*   **Monitor for Side Effects:** Vimpat can cause side effects such as dizziness, headache, nausea, double vision, and fatigue. Be aware of these and report them to your doctor.\n*   **Gradual Titration:** Vimpat is typically started at a low dose and gradually increased to minimize side effects.\n\nThis is a complex case, and it's essential to work closely with your doctors to get to the bottom of it. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek second opinions if you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "An MRI with Neuroquant showed these normative percentiles: Hippocampal Occupancy Score \u2013 32 Hippocampi \u2013 72 Superior Lateral Ventricles \u2013 94 Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74 The hippocampal volume seems normal but the hippocampal occupancy score is very low. What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward. My information: 24F, 110 pounds, conditions: epilepsy, history of COVID, history of vaccine reaction, medications: Trileptal, location of problem: brain, duration: 9 months",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your MRI results and how they might relate to your symptoms, given your medical history. It's important to remember I'm an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses or specific prognoses. This information is for educational purposes and should not replace consultation with your healthcare providers.\n\n**Understanding the Neuroquant Report**\n\n*   **Hippocampal Occupancy Score (32nd percentile):** This is the most concerning finding. It indicates that, relative to other people your age and sex, the space *occupied* by your hippocampus is smaller than expected. It doesn't necessarily mean the hippocampus *volume* is small (more on that later), but rather how much space it takes up in its region. This *could* suggest atrophy or some other structural change.\n*   **Hippocampi (72nd percentile):** This likely refers to the hippocampal *volume*. The fact that it's in the 72nd percentile is *generally* reassuring, suggesting your hippocampus's overall size is within the normal range. *However*, the discrepancy between this and the occupancy score is important and needs further investigation.\n*   **Superior Lateral Ventricles (94th percentile):** Enlarged ventricles (especially in the superior region) can suggest loss of brain tissue, leading to more space filled by cerebrospinal fluid. The higher the percentile, the larger the ventricles compared to the norm for your age.\n*   **Inferior Lateral Ventricles (74th percentile):** Similar to the superior ventricles, this indicates the size of the inferior portions. Again, a higher percentile suggests larger ventricles.\n\n**Interpreting the Discrepancy: Low Occupancy Score vs. Normal Volume**\n\nThis is key to understanding the report and what it *could* mean. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1.  **Hippocampal Shape/Configuration:** The hippocampus might have an unusual shape or position within its normal space. Neuroquant algorithms rely on certain assumptions about brain structure, and deviations from the norm could lead to a lower occupancy score despite a reasonable volume.\n\n2.  **Surrounding Tissue:** The problem may not be *solely* with the hippocampus itself. Changes in surrounding tissues could influence the occupancy score. For example, swelling or inflammation in the area might compress the hippocampus, reducing its occupancy score even if the volume hasn't changed drastically. Conversely, atrophy in surrounding areas could increase ventricular size (as seen in your report) while not directly affecting hippocampal volume but altering its relative occupancy.\n\n3.  **Subtle Atrophy/Damage:** It's possible there's been subtle damage or atrophy within the hippocampus that isn't fully reflected in the overall volume measurement but affects its overall structure or density, thus reducing its space. The 72nd percentile is just a reference, and it is possible that you had an even higher percentile before, or that the 72nd percentile is still affecting you.\n\n4.  **Neuroquant Limitations:** Neuroquant is a valuable tool, but it's not perfect. There can be variability in measurements and interpretation. The scans may also not be of the highest quality.\n\n**Possible Links to Your Symptoms and History**\n\nNow, let's consider how your symptoms and medical history might relate to these findings:\n\n*   **COVID-19 and Vaccine Reaction:** Your theory about the virus affecting the hippocampus is plausible. COVID-19 is known to cause neurological complications in some people. The inflammatory response triggered by the virus or the vaccine *could* have contributed to brain inflammation or subtle damage.\n*   **CBD Oil:** While more research is needed, there are reports of CBD oil causing adverse effects like depersonalization and memory problems in some individuals. It's possible this contributed to your initial symptoms.\n*   **Depression:** A history of depression *can* be associated with changes in brain structure and function, including the hippocampus. However, the timing of your current symptoms suggests a more recent trigger.\n*   **Epilepsy:** Depending on the type and severity, epilepsy can affect cognitive function and potentially brain structure over time, though your young age makes this less likely as the primary driver.\n\n**Prognosis - What to Expect**\n\nI cannot provide a prognosis.  However, here are some factors to consider:\n\n*   **Etiology:** If the underlying cause can be identified and addressed (e.g., managing inflammation, treating an infection), there might be potential for improvement.\n*   **Severity:** The degree of hippocampal occupancy score reduction and ventricular enlargement is important. More severe changes might indicate a less favorable prognosis.\n*   **Time Since Onset:** In some cases, the brain can adapt and compensate for damage. The sooner the issue is addressed, the better the chance of recovery or stabilization.\n*   **Response to Treatment:** If you pursue treatments (e.g., cognitive rehabilitation, medication), your response will be a key indicator of your prognosis.\n\n**Next Steps: What Your Doctors Should Do**\n\n1.  **Neurologist Consultation:** A thorough neurological examination is essential.\n2.  **Review of Medical History:** The neurologist needs a detailed understanding of your COVID-19 infection, vaccine reaction, CBD use, and psychiatric history.\n3.  **Repeat MRI:** A follow-up MRI in 6-12 months might be recommended to assess for any changes or progression.\n4.  **Neuropsychological Testing:** This can provide a more detailed assessment of your cognitive function, including memory, attention, and executive function.\n5.  **Further Investigations:** Depending on the neurologist's assessment, other tests (e.g., EEG, blood tests) might be necessary to rule out other conditions.\n6.  **Consider Alternative Scanning Techniques:**  Discuss with your doctor the possibility of other types of MRI sequences or even different imaging modalities (like PET scan) that might provide more information about hippocampal function and metabolism.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Don't jump to conclusions. Brain imaging findings need to be interpreted in the context of your clinical presentation.\n*   Be your own advocate. Ask questions, express your concerns, and ensure you understand the rationale for any tests or treatments.\n*   Consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders or neuroimaging interpretation.\n\nIt is critical that you consult with qualified medical professionals to discuss these findings and develop an appropriate management plan.\n"

    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the information regarding COVID-19 vaccines, GBS, and considerations for someone with epilepsy controlled by medication like yourself.\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS)**\n\n*   **Increased Risk (Slight):**  There *is* evidence of a slightly increased risk of GBS following certain COVID-19 vaccines, particularly the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (J&J) vaccine.  This risk is still considered very rare.\n*   **mRNA Vaccines (Pfizer & Moderna):** The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) have also been studied regarding GBS.

Their website ([cdc.gov](cdc.gov)) has sections dedicated to COVID-19 vaccines and potential adverse events.\n*   **FDA (Food and Drug Administration):**  The FDA also monitors vaccine safety and can provide information on reported adverse events.\n*   **VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System):** VAERS is a passive surveillance system where anyone can report adverse events following vaccination. While it's helpful for identifying potential safety signals, it's important to note that VAERS reports do not prove causation.\n*   **Published Research:**  PubMed (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a valuable resource for finding peer-reviewed research articles on COVID-19 vaccines and GBS.  Search terms like \"COVID-19 vaccine GBS\" or \"mRNA vaccine Guillain-Barr\u00e9\" can be helpful.\n*   **WHO (World Health Organization):** The WHO also provides information on vaccine safety and efficacy globally.\n\n**Considerations for Your Specific Situation (Epilepsy and GBS History)**\n\n1.  **Controlled Epilepsy:** The fact that your epilepsy is well-controlled with medication is a positive factor. Epilepsy itself is generally *not* considered a contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination.\n2.  **Prior GBS Concern:**  Your previous avoidance of flu vaccines due to GBS concerns is relevant and understandable.  This history needs to be carefully considered.\n3.  **Weighing Risks and Benefits:**  The risk of GBS from COVID-19 vaccination needs to be weighed against the risks of contracting COVID-19 itself, especially considering the potential for severe illness, hospitalization, and long-term complications, particularly in light of any history of GBS.\n\n**Recommendations (Important: Discuss with Your Doctor)**\n\n*   **Consult with Your Neurologist and Primary Care Physician:**  This is the *most important* step. They have your complete medical history and can provide personalized advice.  They can assess your individual risk factors and help you make an informed decision.  Specifically, discuss your concerns about GBS.\n*   **mRNA Vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) as Preferred Choice:** Given the data suggesting a potentially higher risk of GBS with the J&J vaccine, the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are often considered the preferred choice for individuals with concerns about GBS. If you have a previous history of GBS, this is all the more important.\n*   **Consider Pre-Vaccination Discussion:** Talk to your doctor about any potential pre-vaccination measures or monitoring that might be appropriate.\n*   **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date on the latest recommendations from the CDC and other reputable sources. Vaccine recommendations can change over time.\n*   **Report Any Adverse Events:** If you experience any unusual symptoms after vaccination, report them to your doctor and consider reporting them to VAERS.\n\n**Important Points to Emphasize to Your Doctor:**\n\n*   Your history of epilepsy (controlled by medication).\n*   Your previous concern about GBS with flu vaccines.\n*   Your desire to make an informed decision based on the best available evidence.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Neurology only wants to repeat an mri once per year to rule out ms",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a complex and frustrating situation. It's understandable that you're looking for insights. Let's break down your symptoms and potential next steps.\n\n**Summary of Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Onset:** Sudden onset in June 2022 with a \"lightning bolt\" sensation in the chest.\n*   **Neurological Symptoms:**\n    *   Numbness/burning in arms and legs (progressing from extremities).\n    *   Muscle spasms/cramps (worsening).\n    *   Extreme fatigue.\n*   **Rhabdomyolysis:** Recurring, triggered by heat intolerance. CK levels reaching as high as 16,000.\n*   **Heat Intolerance:** Significant, triggers rhabdomyolysis.\n*   **Hormonal:** Low testosterone (addressed with testosterone replacement).\n*   **Negative Tests:** Epilepsy and PNES ruled out. MS and Lyme disease are still possibilities but haven't been confirmed.\n*   **Exercise/Diet:** Offer temporary relief but don't prevent recurring episodes.\n*   **Neurology's Plan:** Annual MRI for MS monitoring.\n\n**Potential Considerations & Next Steps:**\n\nGiven the complexity and the multiple overlapping systems, here are several avenues to explore:\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Metabolic and Mitochondrial Workup:**\n\n    *   **Why:** Rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, and heat intolerance can be linked to metabolic disorders (affecting how your body processes energy) and mitochondrial dysfunction (affecting the \"powerhouses\" of your cells).\n    *   **What to Test:**\n        *   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** Electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, glucose. (You likely already have this, but confirm it's recent).\n        *   **Carnitine Levels (Free and Total):** Issues with carnitine metabolism can lead to rhabdomyolysis.\n        *   **Acylcarnitine Profile:** A more detailed analysis of carnitine metabolism.\n        *   **Lactate and Pyruvate Levels:** Elevated levels can indicate mitochondrial issues, especially after exercise.\n        *   **Urine Organic Acids (OAT):** Can reveal metabolic abnormalities.\n        *   **Creatine Kinase Isoenzymes (CK-MB):** Specifically measure the CK component related to muscle damage.\n        *   **Ammonia Levels:** High ammonia can be associated with metabolic disorders.\n        *   **Consider Genetic Testing:** If a metabolic disorder is suspected, genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.\n    *   **Who to See:** A metabolic specialist or a geneticist (after initial screening with your primary care physician or endocrinologist).\n\n2.  **Expanded Autoimmune Panel:**\n\n    *   **Why:** While MS is being considered, other autoimmune conditions can cause similar symptoms, including neurological issues, fatigue, and muscle problems. Sometimes, autoimmune markers fluctuate, so repeat testing can be helpful.\n    *   **What to Test:**\n        *   **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody):** A general screen for autoimmune disorders.\n        *   **ENA Panel (Extractable Nuclear Antigen):** Tests for antibodies associated with specific autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sj\u00f6gren's, lupus, scleroderma).\n        *   **Rheumatoid Factor (RF):** Associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n        *   **Anti-CCP (Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide):** More specific for rheumatoid arthritis.\n        *   **Myositis-Specific Antibodies:** If muscle weakness or inflammation is suspected, test for antibodies associated with myositis (e.g., anti-Jo-1, anti-SRP, anti-Mi-2).\n        *   **Acetylcholine Receptor Antibodies:** To rule out Myasthenia Gravis (rare, but presents with muscle weakness).\n    *   **Who to See:** A rheumatologist.\n\n3.  **Repeat Lyme Disease Testing with Different Methods:**\n\n    *   **Why:** Lyme disease testing can be complex, and false negatives can occur, especially in chronic cases.\n    *   **What to Do:**\n        *   **Consider a Western Blot Test:** Ensure this was done in addition to the ELISA screen.\n        *   **Repeat Testing with a Different Lab:** Different labs may use different methods or have varying sensitivity.\n        *   **Consider a Lyme Disease Specialist:** A specialist may have more experience with diagnosing and treating complex cases.\n    *   **Important Note:** Many doctors disagree on chronic Lyme disease, so be prepared for varying opinions and treatment approaches.\n\n4.  **Small Fiber Neuropathy Evaluation:**\n\n    *   **Why:** The burning sensation and spreading nature of your neurological symptoms is very suggestive of this. Conventional nerve conduction studies often miss this.\n    *   **How to Test:**\n        *   **Skin Biopsy for Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density:** This is the gold standard for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy.  A small skin sample is taken and analyzed for the density of nerve fibers.\n        *   **Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART):** This tests the function of the small nerve fibers that control sweating.\n    *   **Who to See:** A neurologist specializing in neuropathy.\n\n5.  **Evaluate for Other Neurological Conditions:**\n\n    *   **Spinal Cord Issues:** Although the MRI was clear, sometimes subtle spinal cord problems can be missed. A neurologist might consider a more detailed spinal cord MRI or other tests if your symptoms warrant it.\n    *   **Consider Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) as a possible overlapping diagnosis:** While neurological tests may come back normal, some individuals may have an FND, which causes abnormal nervous system functioning.\n\n6.  **Manage Rhabdomyolysis Triggers:**\n\n    *   **Strict Heat Avoidance:** This is crucial. Avoid strenuous activity in hot environments.\n    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids, especially before, during, and after exercise.\n    *   **Electrolyte Replenishment:** Consider electrolyte drinks or supplements, especially if you sweat a lot.\n    *   **Medication Review:** Some medications can increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Review all your medications with your doctor.\n\n7.  **Cardiac Evaluation (If Chest Pain Persists):**\n\n    *   **Why:** While the initial \"lightning bolt\" sensation may not be directly related, chest pain warrants evaluation, especially given the potential for cardiac involvement in some systemic diseases.\n    *   **What to Do:**\n        *   **EKG (Electrocardiogram):** To assess heart rhythm and electrical activity.\n        *   **Echocardiogram:** To visualize the heart's structure and function.\n        *   **Cardiac Enzymes:** To rule out heart damage.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Symptom Journal:** Track your symptoms, triggers (like heat or exercise), and how you feel each day. This can provide valuable information for your doctors.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't be afraid to ask questions, express your concerns, and seek second opinions if you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting.\n*   **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Given the complexity, it's important to have a team of doctors working together, including a neurologist, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, and potentially a metabolic specialist or geneticist.\n*   **Pace Yourself:** The fatigue can be debilitating. Prioritize rest and find ways to manage your energy levels.\n*   **Consider a Second Opinion from a different Neurologist:** Sometimes a fresh set of eyes can provide new insights or approach the problem from a different angle.\n\n**Regarding the Annual MRI:**\n\nWhile monitoring for MS is important, annual MRIs may not be sufficient if your symptoms are worsening or if other conditions are suspected. Discuss your concerns with your neurologist and ask if more frequent imaging or alternative imaging techniques are warranted.\n\nIt's important to understand that finding the underlying cause of your symptoms may take time and require a thorough investigation. Be patient, persistent, and proactive in your healthcare journey. This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice, and you should always consult with a healthcare professional.\n"

    "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, frustrated, and ashamed after these experiences. Dealing with seizures and the possibility of epilepsy is a lot to process, especially at your age. Let's break down your concerns and explore some steps you can take:\n\n**Understanding Your Situation:**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** The hospital gave you a discharge slip with a diagnosis of epilepsy. This is important, but it's also essential to understand that a diagnosis is based on the available evidence and can sometimes be refined with further investigation.\n*   **Seizures vs. Other Conditions:** While epilepsy involves recurrent, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal brain activity, other conditions can mimic seizures. The person on the forum mentioned vasovagal syncope (fainting). Other possibilities could include cardiac arrhythmias, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), or even metabolic disturbances.\n*   **Importance of Accurate Diagnosis:** The correct diagnosis is crucial because it dictates the appropriate treatment. Epilepsy medication won't help if the issue is something else, and it can even cause unnecessary side effects.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns:**\n\n1.  **Review Your Diagnosis with Your Doctor:** This is the most crucial step. Schedule an appointment with the neurologist or doctor who diagnosed you with epilepsy.  Specifically, tell them:\n    *   **Your doubts:** Explain that you're questioning the diagnosis based on your experiences and what you read online (mention the vasovagal syncope).\n    *   **The details of your seizures:** Describe both seizures in as much detail as possible. Include what you remember before, during (if anything), and after each episode. Tell them about the yelling, the struggle to leave the restaurant, and the lag in your thinking afterward.\n    *   **The circumstances of the seizures:** Did either seizure have a trigger (e.g., lack of sleep, stress, flashing lights, skipping meals)?\n    *   **The forum reply:** Briefly mention that someone online suggested it could be vasovagal syncope.\n\n2.  **Ask About Further Testing:** Don't be afraid to ask your doctor what tests they used to reach the diagnosis and if any other tests can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Common tests for epilepsy and related conditions include:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This measures brain activity and can help identify seizure patterns. It can be done while you're awake, asleep, or even with prolonged monitoring.\n    *   **MRI of the brain:** This helps rule out structural problems in the brain that could be causing seizures.\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** This measures the electrical activity of the heart, and it can help identify cardiac arrhythmias that might be causing fainting spells.\n    *   **Tilt table test:** This test is used to diagnose vasovagal syncope and other types of orthostatic hypotension.\n\n3.  **Discuss Medication Side Effects:** Tell your doctor about the memory decline you're experiencing with Lamictal. They might be able to adjust the dosage, switch you to a different medication with fewer side effects, or explore other treatment options. *Never* stop taking medication without consulting your doctor first, as this can be dangerous and can trigger seizures.\n\n4.  **Address Your Feelings of Shame:** What happened during the seizure was *not your fault.* Seizures are medical events, and you have no control over your actions during them. It's understandable to feel embarrassed, but try to remember that this is a health issue, not a character flaw. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you process these feelings.\n\n5.  **Consider Selective Disclosure:** You don't have to tell everyone about your epilepsy. If you're comfortable, you can share it with trusted friends or family members. Having a support system can make a big difference. Focus on explaining what it means for you in a factual way. For example, \"I've been diagnosed with epilepsy. It means I sometimes have seizures, but I'm taking medication to control them.\"\n\n6.  **Research and Educate Yourself:** Reliable sources like the Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) can provide valuable information about epilepsy, seizures, and treatment options.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** In many places, there are restrictions on driving after having seizures. Be sure to ask your doctor about the rules in Hong Kong and how epilepsy might affect your ability to drive.\n*   **Safety:** Take precautions to protect yourself in case you have another seizure. This might involve avoiding situations where a seizure could be particularly dangerous (e.g., swimming alone, climbing to high places).\n\n**In summary, you need to have an open and honest conversation with your doctor about your doubts, symptoms, and the side effects of your medication. Don't hesitate to ask questions and seek a second opinion if you feel it's necessary. You deserve to have a clear understanding of your condition and the best possible treatment plan.**\n"

    "question": "24 F USA Asthma, epilepsy, hypothyroidismI have laryngeal candidiasis (unknown cause but thought to be from Breo and prednisone?) and it isn't responding much to fluconazole. The next step is amphotericin b and I'm kinda nervous. What should I expect realistically?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down what to expect with Amphotericin B for laryngeal candidiasis, especially given your medical history.  I understand your nervousness; it's a potent medication.  I'll provide realistic information to help you understand what to expect.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for general educational purposes only and does not substitute a consultation with your doctor or specialist. You *must* discuss all of these points with your doctor and address your specific concerns. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual case and medical history.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **Laryngeal Candidiasis:** This is a fungal infection (yeast) in your larynx (voice box). It's uncomfortable and can affect your voice and breathing.\n*   **Fluconazole Resistance:**  The fact that fluconazole isn't working well is concerning. It suggests the *Candida* species involved may be resistant or less susceptible to fluconazole. This is a reason for moving to a stronger antifungal.\n*   **Breo and Prednisone Link:**  Inhaled corticosteroids (like Breo) and oral corticosteroids (like prednisone) can suppress the immune system locally (in the mouth and throat with Breo) and systemically (with prednisone), making you more susceptible to fungal infections like *Candida*.  This is a very common cause of oral and esophageal candidiasis (\"thrush\").\n*   **Amphotericin B:** This is a powerful antifungal medication, often reserved for serious fungal infections or when other antifungals have failed.  It works by binding to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane, disrupting the membrane and leading to fungal cell death.\n\n**Why Amphotericin B?**\n\nBecause fluconazole isn't working, your doctor is choosing a medication with a broader spectrum of activity and a higher likelihood of eradicating the *Candida*. Amphotericin B is a potent drug and can often overcome resistance issues. It's also considered a \"gold standard\" for many serious fungal infections.\n\n**What to Expect with Amphotericin B Treatment**\n\nAmphotericin B can be administered in a few different formulations. The traditional formulation is Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, and the newer formulations are called Lipid formulations of Amphotericin B (LFAmB). LFAmB formulations tend to have less side effects, but are more expensive.\n\n1.  **Administration:**\n    *   **IV Infusion:** Amphotericin B is typically given intravenously (IV) in a hospital or infusion center.\n    *   **Duration:** The length of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and your response. It can range from a few days to several weeks.\n    *   **Pre-medications:** To help minimize side effects, you'll likely receive pre-medications before each infusion. These may include:\n        *   **Antihistamines:** (e.g., diphenhydramine/Benadryl) to reduce allergic reactions.\n        *   **Antipyretics:** (e.g., acetaminophen/Tylenol) to reduce fever.\n        *   **Corticosteroids:** (e.g., hydrocortisone) to reduce inflammation and allergic reactions.\n        *   **Anti-emetics:** (e.g. ondansetron/Zofran) to reduce nausea.\n2.  **Potential Side Effects:** This is the part that makes people nervous, and it's important to be informed. Side effects can vary from mild to severe.  *Not everyone experiences all of these.*\n    *   **Infusion-Related Reactions:** These are the most common and occur during or shortly after the infusion.\n        *   **Fever and Chills:** Very common. This is why pre-medications are so important.\n        *   **Shaking:** Can be intense.\n        *   **Nausea and Vomiting:** Relatively common.\n        *   **Headache:** Common.\n        *   **Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure):** Can occur during the infusion.  Your blood pressure will be monitored closely.\n        *   **Muscle Aches:** Can happen during or after the infusion.\n    *   **Kidney Toxicity (Nephrotoxicity):** This is a major concern with Amphotericin B.\n        *   **Monitoring:** Your kidney function will be monitored *very* closely with blood tests (BUN, creatinine, electrolytes).\n        *   **Hydration:** You'll likely receive IV fluids to help protect your kidneys.\n        *   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Amphotericin B can affect potassium and magnesium levels. These will be monitored and corrected as needed.\n        *   **Strategies to Reduce Nephrotoxicity:** Using a lipid formulation of amphotericin (LFAmB), aggressive hydration, and careful monitoring can help reduce the risk.\n    *   **Anemia:** Amphotericin B can suppress bone marrow function, leading to anemia (low red blood cell count). Your hemoglobin and hematocrit will be monitored.\n    *   **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  As mentioned above, especially low potassium (hypokalemia) and low magnesium (hypomagnesemia).\n    *   **Cardiac Issues:** In rare cases, Amphotericin B can cause heart rhythm problems.  If you have a history of heart issues, this is especially important to discuss with your doctor.\n    *   **Thrombophlebitis:** Inflammation of the vein used for the IV.  Rotating IV sites can help.\n3.  **Monitoring:**\n    *   **Frequent Blood Tests:**  To monitor kidney function, electrolytes, blood counts, and liver function.\n    *   **Vital Signs:**  Your temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be checked regularly, especially during infusions.\n    *   **Clinical Assessment:**  Your doctor will monitor your symptoms (voice changes, pain, difficulty swallowing) to see how well the medication is working.\n4.  **Important Considerations Given Your Medical History:**\n    *   **Asthma:**  The infusion-related reactions could potentially trigger asthma symptoms.  Your doctor will need to be prepared to manage any asthma exacerbations.  Make sure your asthma is well-controlled *before* starting Amphotericin B.\n    *   **Epilepsy:**  Some antifungals can lower the seizure threshold (making seizures more likely).  Discuss this with your doctor. They may want to adjust your anti-epileptic medication or monitor you more closely.\n    *   **Hypothyroidism:**  Amphotericin B itself doesn't directly affect thyroid function, but any significant illness or stress can impact thyroid hormone levels.  Your doctor may want to check your thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) periodically.\n    *   **Other Medications:**  Make sure your doctor is aware of *all* medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as there could be drug interactions.\n5.  **What You Can Do:**\n    *   **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of fluids (as directed by your doctor) to help protect your kidneys.\n    *   **Report Symptoms Promptly:**  Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, especially fever, chills, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or changes in urine output.\n    *   **Follow Instructions Carefully:**  Adhere to the prescribed medication schedule and any dietary recommendations.\n    *   **Rest:** Get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection and recover from the side effects.\n    *   **Advocate for Yourself:** Ask questions!  Don't hesitate to voice your concerns and seek clarification.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   Which formulation of Amphotericin B will I be receiving (Amphotericin B deoxycholate or a lipid formulation)?  Why was this choice made?\n*   What pre-medications will I receive, and why?\n*   How often will my kidney function, electrolytes, and blood counts be monitored?\n*   What are the specific signs and symptoms I should watch out for and report immediately?\n*   How long is the expected duration of treatment?\n*   What is the plan if I experience significant side effects?\n*   Will my anti-epileptic medication need to be adjusted?\n*   Are there any potential drug interactions with my other medications?\n*   What is the success rate of Amphotericin B for laryngeal candidiasis in cases like mine?\n*   What are the alternative treatment options if Amphotericin B is not effective or if I cannot tolerate it?\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nAmphotericin B is a powerful medication that can be effective in treating resistant fungal infections. However, it also has the potential for significant side effects. By understanding the potential risks and benefits, working closely with your healthcare team, and proactively managing your health, you can increase your chances of a successful outcome and minimize complications. Good luck!\n"

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. You're experiencing nocturnal (nighttime) events that you are unaware of, characterized by:\n\n*   **Cramps/Seizures/Attacks:** These are your girlfriend's descriptions, so important to remember that's how she's perceiving them.\n*   **Loss of Awareness:** You don't remember the events.\n*   **Breathing Difficulties & Noises:** As observed by your girlfriend.\n*   **Medication:** Levetiracetam (Keppra) is partially effective, but not eliminating the events.\n*   **Substance Use:** Tobacco (daily), Alcohol (occasional), Cannabis (weekends), LSD (rarely).\n*   **No Diagnosis Yet:** You're seeking potential explanations.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses or advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not substitute professional medical evaluation. It's crucial to continue working closely with your neurologist.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of potential avenues to explore and things to discuss with your neurologist:**\n\n**1. Clarify the Nature of the Events:**\n\n*   **Detailed Description:** The *most* important thing is a very detailed description from your girlfriend. Ask her to keep a log or even try to video record (if possible and comfortable, with your consent) an event. This will be invaluable to your neurologist. Specifics matter:\n    *   What *exactly* does the \"cramp\" look like? Is it muscle twitching, jerking, stiffening? Where on your body?\n    *   What kind of \"weird noises\"? Grunting, groaning, snoring-like sounds, gasping?\n    *   How long do the events last?\n    *   How frequently do they occur?\n    *   What happens *before* the event, if anything? Any specific triggers she notices?\n    *   What happens *after* the event? Confusion, disorientation, fatigue?\n    *   What is your position in bed when the events happen? (Back, side, stomach)\n    *   Are your eyes open or closed?\n    *   Do you lose bladder or bowel control?\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** The events *could* be seizures, but other possibilities need to be ruled out.\n\n**2. Potential Diagnoses to Discuss with Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   **Nocturnal Seizures:** This remains a strong possibility, even though the medication is only partially effective. Seizures can be difficult to control, and finding the right medication and dosage can be a process.\n    *   **Specific Types:** Different types of seizures manifest differently. The details your girlfriend provides will help narrow down the possibilities (e.g., nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy).\n*   **Parasomnias:** These are sleep disorders that involve abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. Examples include:\n    *   **Sleepwalking:** Unlikely given the other symptoms, but needs to be considered.\n    *   **Night Terrors:** More common in children, but can occur in adults. Usually involve screaming and intense fear, which may not fit your description.\n    *   **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD):** In RBD, the muscle paralysis that normally occurs during REM sleep is absent. This allows you to act out your dreams, sometimes violently.  Could explain movements and noises.\n*   **Sleep Apnea:** This is a condition where you repeatedly stop and start breathing during sleep.  It can cause loud snoring, gasping, and other breathing disturbances, which could be what your girlfriend is hearing. This can also cause arousals from sleep that you might not remember.\n*   **Nocturnal Panic Attacks:** These are sudden episodes of intense fear that occur during sleep. They can cause physical symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and a racing heart.\n*   **Movement Disorders:**\n    *   **Nocturnal Leg Cramps:** While you said \"cramps,\" nocturnal leg cramps are usually very painful and you would likely remember them upon waking.\n    *   **Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD):** This involves repetitive jerking movements of the legs (and sometimes arms) during sleep.\n\n**3. Diagnostic Testing:**\n\n*   **Polysomnography (Sleep Study):** This is the most important next step. A sleep study monitors your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, oxygen levels, and muscle movements during sleep. This can help differentiate between seizures, parasomnias, sleep apnea, and other sleep disorders.  Ask your neurologist specifically if they're looking for seizure activity during the sleep study.\n*   **Video EEG:** If seizures are suspected, a video EEG during sleep can help capture seizure activity and pinpoint its origin in the brain.  Ideally, you would be monitored overnight with video and EEG.\n*   **MRI of the Brain:** To rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing the events.\n\n**4. Lifestyle Factors & Substance Use:**\n\n*   **Substance Use & Seizures:** It's *essential* to discuss your substance use openly and honestly with your neurologist.\n    *   **Alcohol:** Can disrupt sleep patterns and lower the seizure threshold (making seizures more likely).\n    *   **Cannabis:**  The effects of cannabis on seizures are complex and not fully understood. Some studies suggest it may help control seizures in some people, while others suggest it may worsen them.  Regardless, it can interact with your medication.\n    *   **LSD:**  Can trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.\n    *   **Tobacco:** Nicotine can affect sleep and potentially interact with medications.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**\n    *   **Regular Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends.\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool Room:** Optimize your sleep environment.\n    *   **Avoid Caffeine & Alcohol Before Bed:** These can disrupt sleep.\n    *   **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Take a warm bath, read a book, or listen to calming music before bed.\n\n**5. Questions to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   \"Based on my girlfriend's description, what are the most likely possibilities?\"\n*   \"What specific tests do you recommend, and why?\"\n*   \"How will the results of these tests help us determine the cause of my events?\"\n*   \"Are there any lifestyle changes I should make that could help?\"\n*   \"How might my substance use be affecting my condition and my medication?\"\n*   \"What are the potential side effects of Levetiracetam, and are there alternative medications we could consider if it's not fully effective?\"\n*   \"What is the long-term outlook for my condition?\"\n\n**In summary, your next steps are:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Event Log:** Have your girlfriend keep a very detailed log of the events.\n2.  **Schedule a Follow-Up:**  Make a follow-up appointment with your neurologist to discuss the events in detail and the possibility of a sleep study and other diagnostic tests.\n3.  **Be Open & Honest:** Be completely honest with your neurologist about your substance use and lifestyle.\n4.  **Follow Medical Advice:** Adhere to your neurologist's recommendations for testing, medication, and lifestyle changes.\n\nIt's understandable to feel anxious and want answers.  Keep advocating for yourself and working closely with your medical team. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation with a long history. It's understandable that witnessing an attack for the first time, especially with the physical manifestation of his face turning purple, was alarming and prompted you to call an ambulance. Let's break down the key aspects and potential avenues to explore:\n\n**Understanding the Situation:**\n\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) vs. Vasovagal Syncope (Fainting):** This is crucial. The description strongly suggests a diagnosis of PNES, a type of conversion disorder where psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms resembling seizures, but without the abnormal electrical activity in the brain seen in epilepsy. However, vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of fainting and given his anxiety around needles and medical procedures this is important to consider as well. This is triggered by the vagus nerve and causes a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to loss of consciousness. Some symptoms overlap, and the differentiation is key.\n*   **Trigger:** The clear link to anxiety, particularly fear of needles and medical procedures, is a significant indicator. This points towards a psychological rather than neurological origin.\n*   **Symptoms:**\n    *   Loss of consciousness (\"light going further and further away,\" \"black void,\" \"hammering noise\").\n    *   Possible motor activity (kicking, trembling, shaking). While these can resemble a seizure, the absence of post-ictal confusion (the period of grogginess and disorientation after a real seizure) is important.\n    *   Cyanosis (purple face): This indicates a lack of oxygen. It's vital to rule out any underlying respiratory issues.\n*   **Normal Tests:** Repeated normal EEG results and blood tests strongly argue against epilepsy and other organic causes.\n*   **History:** Drug use as a teenager, while potentially relevant to his overall mental health, is less likely to be the direct cause of the attacks happening now, especially considering the specific trigger. Past medical history is still important to note.\n*   **Mental Health:** The documented depression, anxiety, and panic disorder are critical contextual factors. PNES is often associated with underlying mental health conditions.\n*   **Treatment History:** CBT without systematic exposure therapy for the specific phobia of needles is a missed opportunity.\n\n**Immediate Concerns and Actions:**\n\n*   **Rule Out Vasovagal Syncope or an underlying respiratory condition:** While PNES is likely given the negative neurological testing, it is important to rule out cardiac or respiratory causes for the cyanosis.\n\n**Next Steps and Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Definitive Diagnosis and Assessment:**\n    *   **Comprehensive Evaluation by a Specialist:** He needs to be seen by a neurologist AND a psychiatrist or psychologist experienced in treating PNES/conversion disorder, vasovagal syncope, and anxiety disorders. A team approach is often best. If they think its Vasovagal Syncope, a cardiologist should be consulted as well.\n    *   **Video-EEG Monitoring:** If there is still any doubt about the diagnosis, consider video-EEG monitoring during a simulated anxiety-provoking situation (if ethically and practically feasible). This can help definitively rule out epilepsy and document the event.\n    *   **Psychological Assessment:** A thorough assessment to explore the underlying psychological factors contributing to the attacks. This should include exploring trauma, past experiences, and current stressors.\n\n2.  **Treatment Plan:**\n\n    *   **Psychotherapy (Crucial):**\n        *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** *Specifically* tailored to address his anxiety, panic disorder, and fear of needles. This *must* include systematic exposure therapy. This involves gradually exposing him to needle-related stimuli in a safe and controlled environment, starting with the least anxiety-provoking and progressively working up to actual needle procedures. Relaxation techniques and cognitive restructuring are also essential.\n        *   **Trauma-Informed Therapy:** If there's a history of trauma, addressing it through EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or other trauma-focused therapies can be beneficial.\n        *   **Mindfulness-Based Therapies:** Mindfulness meditation and other mindfulness techniques can help him develop awareness of his physical sensations and emotional reactions, allowing him to better manage anxiety.\n        *  **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Useful if there are difficulties with emotion regulation.\n    *   **Medication (Consideration):**\n        *   **SSRIs/SNRIs:** For underlying depression and anxiety.\n        *   **Anti-Anxiety Medications:** May be helpful as needed, but should be used judiciously and in conjunction with therapy.\n        *   *Avoid* Opioids: As they can be problematic and not address the underlying issue.\n    *   **Lifestyle Changes:**\n        *   **Regular Exercise:** Helps reduce anxiety and improve overall mood.\n        *   **Healthy Diet:** Supports physical and mental well-being.\n        *   **Stress Management Techniques:** Yoga, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation.\n        *   **Adequate Sleep:** Crucial for both physical and mental health.\n\n3.  **Management of Attacks:**\n\n    *   **Education:** He needs to understand what's happening during the attacks. Knowledge is empowering.\n    *   **Safety Plan:** Develop a plan with him and your doctor or therapist for what to do during an attack. This should include:\n        *   **Safe Environment:** Move him to a safe place where he can't injure himself.\n        *   **Reassurance:** Speak calmly and reassuringly. Let him know you're there for him and that the attack will pass.\n        *   **Loosen Clothing:** If his clothing is constricting.\n        *   **Do NOT Restrain Him:** Unless he's in immediate danger of hurting himself or others.\n        *   **Monitor Breathing:** If he turns blue, ensure his airway is open.\n        *   **When to Call Emergency Services:** If the attack lasts longer than usual, if he injures himself, or if you are concerned about his breathing.\n\n**Important Considerations for You:**\n\n*   **Support:** This is stressful for you. Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist.\n*   **Education:** Learn as much as you can about PNES and anxiety disorders.\n*   **Boundaries:** It's important to be supportive but also set boundaries to protect your own well-being.\n*   **Patience:** This is a process. There will be ups and downs. Celebrate small victories.\n\n**Why CBT with Exposure Therapy is Critical:**\n\nExposure therapy directly addresses the core of the problem: the learned association between needles/medical procedures and panic. By gradually exposing him to these stimuli in a safe and controlled way, he can learn that these situations are not inherently dangerous, and his anxiety response will diminish over time.\n\n**In summary, his situation requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a neurologist, psychiatrist/psychologist specializing in anxiety and conversion disorders, and a commitment to intensive psychotherapy, particularly CBT with systematic exposure therapy. Ruling out all other possibilities is important too!**\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and try to understand what might be happening.  It's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. You absolutely need to follow up with your doctor and any specialists they recommend. This information is for educational purposes only.\n\n**Understanding Brain Zaps:**\n\n*   **Description:** You describe a classic presentation of \"brain zaps.\" These are often described as brief, electrical shock-like sensations in the head, sometimes accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and paresthesias (tingling or numbness) in other parts of the body.  The numbness in your tongue is less common but not unheard of.\n*   **Common Causes:** The most frequent cause of brain zaps is related to withdrawal or changes in the dosage of certain medications, particularly antidepressants (especially SSRIs and SNRIs). Less commonly, they can occur with other medications, and sometimes without any medication change.\n*   **Strattera and Brain Zaps:** While brain zaps are *less commonly* associated with Strattera withdrawal compared to SSRIs/SNRIs, it *is* still a possibility, especially with inconsistent use. Strattera affects norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that, when rapidly altered, can sometimes trigger these sensations in susceptible individuals.\n\n**Your Specific Situation and Potential Considerations:**\n\n1.  **Medication Inconsistency:** The fact that you were not taking your Strattera consistently for a couple of months and then resumed daily use is the *most likely* culprit.  Even though you've been on it for 5 years, your brain may have adjusted to periods of lower medication levels, and the re-establishment of consistent dosing could be causing this temporary imbalance.\n\n2.  **Neurological History:** Your history of ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, past tic disorder, and occasional non-epileptic seizures adds complexity.  These conditions indicate a potentially more sensitive neurological system. While these conditions themselves don't directly *cause* brain zaps, they might make you more susceptible to experiencing them due to underlying neurological differences.\n\n3.  **MRI Recommendation:** Your doctor is right to recommend an MRI, *especially* given the novelty of this symptom for you.  While brain zaps themselves are usually benign, the MRI is to rule out any other structural or underlying issues that could be contributing to the problem. A previous MRI, especially one done in childhood, doesn't rule out the possibility of changes or new findings.\n\n4.  **Non-Epileptic Seizures:**  Since you have a history of non-epileptic seizures, it's important to consider whether these brain zaps could be related in some way. While brain zaps are typically very brief and distinct from seizures, it's worth discussing this connection with your doctor.\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n*   **Follow Up with Your Doctor:** This is paramount.  Discuss your concerns, the MRI results, and any further testing they recommend. If they are not a neurologist, consider asking for a referral.\n*   **Neurologist Consultation:**  A neurologist is the ideal specialist to evaluate this, given your neurological history and the nature of the symptoms. They can help determine if the brain zaps are related to medication, your existing conditions, or something else entirely.\n*   **Medication Management:** *Do not* abruptly stop or change your Strattera dosage without consulting your doctor. If the brain zaps are indeed related to the medication, they can advise on a gradual tapering schedule, if necessary.\n*   **Detailed Symptom Journal:** Keep a detailed log of when the brain zaps occur, what you were doing before, any potential triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, etc.), and their severity. This information can be valuable for your doctor.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize good sleep hygiene: consistent sleep schedule, dark/quiet/cool room, avoid caffeine before bed. Poor sleep can sometimes exacerbate neurological symptoms.\n*   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to manage stress, as stress can sometimes worsen neurological symptoms.\n\n**Why Your Doctor Doesn't Think It's the Medication:**\n\nGeneral practitioners sometimes have less experience with the nuances of medication side effects and withdrawal symptoms than psychiatrists or neurologists. While it's true that brain zaps are more commonly associated with SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, they *can* occur with other medications. The fact that you had inconsistent use makes it more plausible in your case. Your doctor is likely being cautious by ruling out other potential causes with an MRI.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe brain zaps are most likely related to the inconsistent use of your Strattera, but it's essential to rule out other potential causes, especially given your neurological history. The MRI is a good step. Follow up with your doctor and consider a consultation with a neurologist. Keep a detailed symptom journal, and prioritize good sleep and stress management. Do not change your medication without medical advice. Good luck, and I hope you find answers soon!\n"

    "question": "Age 23 Sex M Hypertension, Hypothyroid, pre-diabetes, ADHD, Anxiety Disorder and panic attacksOkay so my MRI's report is normal, here:https://imgur.com/a/OiCEZ3N I get these body jerks so the doctor was thinking it's Myoclonic Epilepsy or Motor Tics. But the Motor Tics medicine isn't doing any good to me so the doc was thinking about Myoclonic Epilepsy. But my MRI report is fine? Do i still need to worry? I have ADHD, Panic attacks and Anxiety Disorder problems and even normal MRI is killing me inside why am i having those jerks!?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. It's understandable to feel anxious and frustrated when you're experiencing symptoms like body jerks, especially when you're already dealing with multiple health conditions and a normal MRI result adds to the confusion.\n\n**Here's what we can gather from your situation:**\n\n*   **Symptoms:** You're experiencing involuntary body jerks.\n*   **Existing Conditions:** You have a complex medical history including hypertension, hypothyroidism, pre-diabetes, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and panic attacks.\n*   **Initial Suspicions:** Your doctor is considering myoclonic epilepsy or motor tics as potential causes for the jerks.\n*   **Treatment Response:** Medication for motor tics hasn't been effective.\n*   **MRI Results:** Your MRI report is normal.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns:**\n\n1.  **Normal MRI Doesn't Rule Everything Out:** It's essential to understand that a normal MRI doesn't exclude all possibilities.\n    *   **Myoclonic Epilepsy:** While MRI can detect structural abnormalities often associated with some types of epilepsy, some forms of myoclonic epilepsy don't have visible structural changes on MRI. The brain can be functioning abnormally without showing a physical abnormality on the scan.\n    *   **Motor Tics:** Motor tics are often related to issues with neurotransmitter function and brain circuitry, which are usually not visible on an MRI.\n    *   **Other Neurological Conditions:** Some neurological conditions present with symptoms similar to myoclonic jerks, but don't necessarily have MRI findings.\n\n2.  **Why Are You Still Having Jerks with a Normal MRI?**\n    *   **Functional vs. Structural:** The MRI primarily looks at the *structure* of your brain. It doesn't directly assess the *function* or electrical activity. Your symptoms could be related to how your brain cells are communicating (neurotransmitter imbalances, abnormal electrical activity) rather than a physical abnormality.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:** Consider whether any of your current medications (for ADHD, anxiety, hypertension, or hypothyroidism) could potentially be contributing to the jerks.\n    *   **Stress and Anxiety:** Anxiety and stress can definitely exacerbate neurological symptoms, including tics and jerks. Your existing anxiety disorder and panic attacks could be playing a significant role.\n    *   **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Less likely, but sometimes systemic conditions (like electrolyte imbalances) can cause neurological symptoms.\n\n3.  **Next Steps & What to Do:**\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This test measures the electrical activity in your brain. An EEG can help determine if the jerks are related to seizure activity, even if the MRI is normal. Ask your doctor if an EEG is appropriate given your symptoms and the diagnostic uncertainty.\n    *   **Neurotransmitter Evaluation:** It might be reasonable to discuss with your doctor about testing neurotransmitter levels, although its limited in utility and not commonly done.\n    *   **Medication Review:** Work with your doctor to carefully review all your current medications to see if any of them are known to cause or worsen jerks.  Discuss any potential adjustments to your medications, but *do not* change your medication regimen without consulting your doctor.\n    *   **Neurology Consultation:** If you haven't already, consider seeing a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders or epilepsy. They can provide a more specialized evaluation and treatment plan.\n    *   **Stress Management and Therapy:** Since anxiety can worsen neurological symptoms, exploring stress management techniques (mindfulness, meditation) and therapy (CBT) could be beneficial.\n    *   **Lifestyle Factors:** Ensure you are getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding excessive caffeine or alcohol, as these can sometimes trigger or worsen neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Video Recording:** Try to record an episode of the jerks (if safe and possible) to show your doctor. This can help them better understand the nature of the movements.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate for yourself:** Don't hesitate to ask your doctor questions and express your concerns. If you feel like your concerns aren't being adequately addressed, consider seeking a second opinion.\n*   **Be Patient:** Diagnosing neurological conditions can sometimes be a process of elimination. It may take time to pinpoint the cause of your jerks and find the right treatment.\n*   **Communicate openly:** Keep your doctor informed about any changes in your symptoms, medications, or lifestyle.\n\nIn summary, while a normal MRI is reassuring in some ways, it doesn't eliminate the need for further investigation and management of your symptoms. Focus on working closely with your doctor to explore other potential causes, manage your anxiety, and optimize your overall health.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "The other day I didn't use the dosage cup and just swallowed some Pepto-Bismol Max. I guess it was maybe a mouthful? I don't know how much that is but it felt like a \"large swallow\". Maybe as much as the max daily dosage of 120mL. That was all I had for at least 24 hours in either direction.I don't think I feel any symptoms different than what I usually feel. I read that toxicity can cause confusion and ringing in the ears. But I always seem to have ringing in the ears from time to time, and I have epilepsy so I'm always a little tired and confused (I take carbamazapine 300mg 2x).How concerned should I be? 28 year old white male. About 160lbs and 5'6",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's good that you're being proactive and aware of potential side effects. Given that you're already taking medication for epilepsy and have some pre-existing conditions, it's definitely wise to check in about this.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you should contact a doctor or other qualified health professional as soon as possible:\n\n*   **Uncertainty of Dosage:** You estimated the amount you took, but it's hard to be precise without the dosage cup. This is important because the potential for side effects is related to the amount of the active ingredient, bismuth subsalicylate, you ingested.\n*   **Potential for Interaction:** Pepto-Bismol can interact with other medications, including carbamazepine. Although you haven't noticed new or worsened symptoms, potential interactions can be subtle and still cause harm. The doctor would need a more thorough assessment.\n*   **Underlying Conditions:** You have epilepsy and mention tiredness and confusion, which can be side effects of your medication or the epilepsy itself. Pepto-Bismol toxicity *can* also cause these symptoms, making it more difficult to distinguish the cause.\n*   **Precautionary Principle:** It's always better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to medication. Given your concerns and pre-existing conditions, contacting a professional is the best course of action.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1.  **Call your doctor as soon as possible.** Explain the situation, including your medical history, medication list, and the estimated amount of Pepto-Bismol you took. They can advise you on the best course of action.\n2.  **If you can't reach your doctor immediately, call a pharmacist.** They can also provide guidance on potential interactions and side effects.\n3.  **If you experience any new or worsening symptoms (severe abdominal pain, vomiting, black stools, significant confusion, seizures), seek immediate medical attention.**\n4.  **Do not take any more Pepto-Bismol until you have spoken with a healthcare professional.**\n\n**Important to note:** I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional.

    "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a truly terrible situation, and I understand your desperation and concern for your girlfriend's well-being.  The sudden onset of these debilitating symptoms after the second vaccination strongly suggests a connection, even if conventional tests aren't revealing the cause. It's crucial to continue seeking medical answers, but also to explore any potential avenues that might offer relief. Here's a breakdown of suggestions, categorized for clarity:\n\n**I. Immediate Actions and Safety:**\n\n*   **Never leave her alone:**  This is paramount.  Even a short trip to the store could be disastrous.  Constant supervision is essential.\n*   **Create a safe environment:**  Pad sharp corners, remove obstacles, and ensure a soft landing surface in areas where she spends time.\n*   **Emergency plan:**  Develop a detailed emergency plan with contact information for emergency services, her doctors, and a concise summary of her condition and medications (even though she can't tolerate many).  Keep this information readily available.\n*   **Documentation:** Meticulously document every attack \u2013 time, duration, preceding symptoms, activities just before, and any observations during and after. This detailed log can be invaluable for doctors, even if it feels repetitive.\n\n**II. Further Medical Investigations:**\n\n*   **Demand an EEG during an event:** This is CRITICAL. You are absolutely right that examinations outside of an attack are unlikely to show anything. Work with her medical team to arrange for continuous EEG monitoring, either at home (if possible) or in the hospital, to capture brain activity *during* an attack.  This is the best chance of identifying any neurological abnormalities. If the doctors refuse, insist on a documented reason for their refusal.\n*   **Tilt Table Test:**  While you mentioned dizziness, a tilt table test can help diagnose orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing) or vasovagal syncope (fainting due to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure). This test might reveal subtle cardiovascular issues that are not apparent during routine exams.\n*   **Autonomic Nervous System Testing:**  Explore the possibility of autonomic dysfunction. This system controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Dysregulation could explain some of her symptoms. Testing may involve sweat tests, heart rate variability analysis, and blood pressure monitoring.\n*   **Detailed Neurological Consultation:**  Seek out a specialist neurologist with expertise in complex neurological disorders and experience with vaccine-related adverse events (if possible). They may be able to suggest more specialized tests or have a different perspective.\n*   **Ruling out other conditions:** Even though previous tests may have been negative, consider re-evaluating for less common conditions that might mimic her symptoms.\n    *   **Cardiac arrhythmia monitoring:**  A prolonged or wearable heart monitor (e.g., Holter monitor or event recorder) can detect intermittent heart rhythm problems that might cause fainting.\n    *   **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):** This condition involves the inappropriate release of mast cell mediators, leading to a variety of symptoms. It can be triggered by vaccines in some cases.  Tests involve measuring histamine and other mediators in the blood and urine.\n    *   **Mitochondrial Disorders:** These disorders affect the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures in cells. While rare, they can cause neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Cervical Spine Instability:** While less likely, cervical spine instability can impinge on nerves and blood vessels, potentially causing neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** While less likely, POTS can cause fainting or lightheadedness after standing up.\n*   **Consider Long COVID clinics/specialists:**  Even if you believe it's vaccine-related, some long COVID clinics are becoming more adept at managing complex post-viral/post-vaccination symptoms. They may have access to cutting-edge diagnostic tools and treatment approaches.\n\n**III. Dietary and Lifestyle Considerations:**\n\n*   **Small, Frequent Meals:**  Given her difficulty tolerating large meals, focus on very small, frequent meals throughout the day to maintain blood sugar levels and prevent nutritional deficiencies.\n*   **Hydration:**  Ensure she drinks plenty of fluids, but avoid large amounts at once.  Consider electrolyte solutions to help maintain fluid balance.\n*   **Elimination Diet:**  Work with a registered dietitian to explore an elimination diet to identify potential food sensitivities or intolerances that might be contributing to her symptoms.\n*   **Gentle Exercise:**  If possible, encourage gentle exercise, like short walks, when she feels up to it. Avoid strenuous activity that triggers attacks.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Establish a regular sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to promote restful sleep.\n*   **Compression Stockings:**  If orthostatic hypotension is suspected, compression stockings can help improve blood flow to the brain.\n\n**IV. Supportive Therapies (Use with extreme caution and under medical supervision):**\n\n*   **Acupuncture:**  Some people find acupuncture helpful for managing pain, dizziness, and other neurological symptoms.\n*   **Physical Therapy:**  A physical therapist can help improve balance, coordination, and muscle strength.\n*   **Vestibular Rehabilitation:** If dizziness is a prominent symptom, vestibular rehabilitation therapy can help improve balance and reduce dizziness.\n\n**V. Addressing the Psychological Impact:**\n\n*   **Therapy/Counseling:**  This is crucial for both of you.  The stress of this situation is immense, and a therapist can provide coping strategies and support. For your girlfriend, therapy can help her deal with the anxiety, fear, and depression associated with her condition.  For you, it can provide a safe space to process your own emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n*   **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide a sense of community and validation. Look for online or in-person support groups for people with chronic illnesses or neurological disorders.\n\n**VI. Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS):** Report her symptoms to VAERS. While this won't provide immediate medical help, it contributes to the overall understanding of vaccine-related adverse events.\n*   **Legal Consultation:**  Consult with a lawyer specializing in vaccine injury. They can advise you on your legal options and help you navigate the complex legal landscape.\n*   **Don't Give Up:** This is a long and difficult road, but it's essential not to lose hope. Keep advocating for your girlfriend, keep seeking answers, and keep providing her with love and support.\n\n**VII. The Issue of Medication Intolerance:**\n\nThis is a serious challenge. The fact that she reacts negatively to so many medications suggests a heightened sensitivity, possibly related to autonomic dysfunction or MCAS.\n\n*   **Ultra-low doses:** Explore the possibility of trying medications at extremely low doses, gradually increasing them under strict medical supervision. This approach might allow her body to adapt to the medication without triggering severe reactions.\n*   **Compounding pharmacies:** Compounding pharmacies can create customized medications without certain fillers or additives that might be causing her reactions.\n\n**Regarding the possibility of suicide:**\n\nYou are absolutely right to be concerned. It's critical to address this directly and proactively.\n\n*   **Crisis hotline:** Have the numbers for local crisis hotlines readily available.\n*   **Therapy:** As mentioned earlier, therapy is crucial for addressing suicidal thoughts and providing coping strategies.\n*   **Safety plan:** Work with a therapist to develop a safety plan that outlines steps to take if she experiences suicidal thoughts. This plan might include identifying triggers, coping mechanisms, and people to contact for support.\n\nThis situation is incredibly challenging, and I want to emphasize that you are not alone. Keep advocating for your girlfriend, keep seeking answers, and never give up hope.  I truly hope you find the answers and support you need to help her regain her health and quality of life.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "I\u2019m a 23 year old female. I have recently been getting very dizzy, my body gets hot and seeing stars until my vision disappears completely and I can\u2019t see at all and it doesn\u2019t go away until I lay down or sit. I have never had a problem like this ever but it\u2019s starting to interfere with my life because I\u2019m always having to sit. I\u2019m 5\u201d3 and I weigh around a 100 pounds. My weight does fluctuate a lot (+ or - 5 pounds every week) I try to eat healthy but I also sometimes can\u2019t get myself to eat because I feel anxiety and my heart starts beating weird. I also have epilepsy and I am on Keppra and have been on it for almost 3 years so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem but I try to take it on time, I take 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don\u2019t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time. I add a lot of salt on my food, I eat a lot of olives and a lot of pickles, sometimes I will individually season spoonfuls or food before putting them in my mouth because it\u2019s what tastes good to me (if that is of any significance)And I do drink alcohol about 3 times a week",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Yes, you should definitely be concerned about these symptoms and seek medical attention as soon as possible. The combination of dizziness, vision changes (seeing stars and vision loss), feeling hot, and the need to lie down is worrisome and could indicate a number of potential underlying medical conditions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is concerning and what you should do:\n\n**Why it's concerning:**\n\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension:** This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up, causing dizziness, lightheadedness, and sometimes vision changes.  It's a common cause of your symptoms, but it needs to be investigated to determine the underlying cause.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope:** This occurs when your body overreacts to triggers like stress, pain, or standing for too long. It can cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to fainting.\n*   **Cardiac Issues:** Although less likely at your age, it's important to rule out any underlying heart conditions, especially given your description of your heart beating \"weird.\"  These issues can cause similar symptoms to what you're experiencing.\n*   **Anemia:**  Iron deficiency anemia can cause dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness, especially with changes in position. Your fluctuating weight and occasional difficulty eating could contribute to this.\n*   **Dehydration:** Dehydration can lead to low blood volume and similar symptoms.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** While you've been on Keppra for a while, it's always worth re-evaluating potential side effects, especially since these symptoms are new. Interactions with alcohol are also a possibility.\n*   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Your high salt intake could be contributing to electrolyte imbalances, which can affect blood pressure and heart function.\n*   **Other Possibilities:** There are other less common but potentially serious conditions that could be causing these symptoms, which is why a thorough evaluation is necessary.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor Immediately:** Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or an urgent care facility as soon as possible. Do not delay. Explain your symptoms in detail and mention your epilepsy, Keppra medication, eating habits, alcohol consumption, and high salt intake.\n\n2.  **Keep a Symptom Diary:** Before your appointment, start keeping a detailed diary of your symptoms. Note:\n\n    *   When the dizziness and vision changes occur (time of day, after eating, after standing, etc.)\n    *   What you were doing immediately before the episode\n    *   How long the symptoms last\n    *   Any other symptoms you experience (headache, nausea, chest pain, palpitations, etc.)\n    *   Your blood pressure, if you can check it (home blood pressure monitors are readily available) - check while lying down, sitting, and standing.\n    *   What you ate in the hours before the episode.\n    *   How much water you drank in the day.\n\n3.  **Possible Tests:** Be prepared for your doctor to order tests, which may include:\n\n    *   **Physical Examination:** Thorough examination, including checking your heart rate and blood pressure in different positions (lying, sitting, standing).\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for anemia, electrolyte imbalances, kidney function, thyroid function, and other potential issues.\n    *   **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** To evaluate your heart's electrical activity.\n    *   **Possibly an EEG:** Especially because you have epilepsy, your doctor might want to rule out any changes in seizure activity.\n    *   **Tilt Table Test:** This test can help diagnose orthostatic hypotension or vasovagal syncope.\n\n4.  **Hydrate:** Make sure you are adequately hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Even though you consume a lot of salt, dehydration could be contributing to your issues.\n\n5.  **Avoid Alcohol (Temporarily):** Until you see a doctor, it's best to abstain from alcohol to see if it makes a difference and to avoid any potential interactions with your medication or underlying condition.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's tempting to try and figure out what's wrong on your own, but it's crucial to get a professional medical evaluation.\n*   **Don't Ignore These Symptoms:** These symptoms can be indicative of a serious underlying problem, so it's essential to take them seriously and seek medical help promptly.\n*   **Be Honest with Your Doctor:** Provide your doctor with all relevant information about your medical history, medications, diet, and lifestyle.\n\nIn summary, your symptoms warrant immediate medical attention. Please see a doctor as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n"

    "question": "25f 110ish lbs Everyday smoker Cannabis use Non drinker 200mg lamotrigine 2x daily 400mg zonsimide 2x daily Refractory epilepsy of unknown origin(possibly localized but won't know until I go in for my EMU)Hello so as you can see I have refractory epilepsy and my specialist and I are talking about me begining the steps towards a surgical approach as I'm still having breakthrough seizures. I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand you're looking for alternative options for managing your refractory epilepsy before committing to surgery or a VNS. It's completely reasonable to explore all possibilities, especially when dealing with a condition as complex and disruptive as epilepsy.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** *I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for treatment. You MUST discuss any potential treatment options with your neurologist and other qualified healthcare professionals.*\n\n**Understanding Refractory Epilepsy:**\n\nRefractory epilepsy (also known as drug-resistant epilepsy) means that seizures haven't been adequately controlled by at least two appropriate anti-seizure medications (ASMs). This doesn't mean there are *no* other options, but it does mean finding solutions can be more challenging and often involves more specialized approaches.\n\n**Review of Current Treatment:**\n\nIt's important to ensure your current medication regimen is optimized. This means:\n\n*   **Dosage Optimization:** Are you at the maximum tolerated dose for both lamotrigine and zonisamide?\n*   **Adherence:** Are you consistently taking your medications exactly as prescribed? Missed doses can significantly increase seizure risk.\n*   **Drug Interactions:** Have potential interactions with cannabis been fully investigated, as well as any over-the-counter medications or supplements you might be taking?\n*   **Consider Genetic Testing:** It is possible to do genetic testing to look for other options that might be more effective in your case.\n*   **Review with Neurologist:** Talk to your neurologist and review if there are any changes to your medications that can be made before you attempt surgery.\n\n**Potential Alternative Options to Discuss with Your Neurologist:**\n\nThese are things to bring up with your neurologist to determine if they're appropriate and safe *for you*:\n\n1.  **Dietary Therapies:**\n    *   **Ketogenic Diet:** This high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet has shown effectiveness in some individuals with epilepsy, particularly children. It alters brain metabolism. *Requires strict medical supervision and dietician guidance.*\n    *   **Modified Atkins Diet (MAD):** A less restrictive version of the ketogenic diet that may be easier to adhere to long-term. Also requires medical supervision.\n    *   **Low Glycemic Index Treatment (LGIT):** Another dietary approach that focuses on foods that cause a slower rise in blood sugar.\n    *   **MCT Diet:** MCT can be metabolized in the liver and creates ketones which act as a secondary fuel source for the brain which can help to reduce the number of seizures a person has.\n\n2.  **Lifestyle Modifications (Beyond what you've already done - reinforce these):**\n    *   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Prioritize consistent sleep schedules and sufficient sleep duration. Sleep deprivation is a well-known seizure trigger.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Explore techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Chronic stress can exacerbate seizures.\n    *   **Regular Exercise:** Regular physical activity can have a positive impact on seizure control for some individuals. *Discuss appropriate exercise types with your doctor.*\n    *   **Avoid Known Triggers:**  Be meticulous in identifying and avoiding any personal seizure triggers (e.g., flashing lights, certain sounds, specific foods).\n    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can be a seizure trigger for some.\n    *   **Reduce Cannabis Use:** I understand you are an everyday smoker, but while there are some people who use cannabis to control their seizures, there are no well done studies on cannabis as a treatment for epilepsy. Also while some may have the intended effect, cannabis can also interact with other medications to reduce the drugs level in the body, which might make it harder to control your seizures.\n3.  **Neurostimulation Therapies (Beyond VNS):**\n    *   **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):** A device implanted in the brain that detects abnormal electrical activity and delivers targeted stimulation to prevent seizures.\n    *   **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**  Involves implanting electrodes in specific brain regions to regulate neural activity. (Less common for epilepsy, but used in some cases).\n    *   **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS):** A non-invasive technique that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate or inhibit brain activity. May have a role in managing epilepsy symptoms in some individuals. (Still under investigation).\n\n4.  **Clinical Trials:**\n    *   **Investigational Medications/Devices:** Participating in a clinical trial may give you access to cutting-edge treatments or devices that are not yet widely available.\n    *   **Find Trials:** Websites like clinicaltrials.gov can help you search for relevant epilepsy trials. *Discuss potential trials with your neurologist.*\n\n5.  **Regarding Chiropractic and Acupuncture:**\n\n    *   **Chiropractic:** There is *very limited* scientific evidence to support the use of chiropractic treatment for epilepsy. Some anecdotal reports exist, but these are not reliable.  Generally, the medical community does *not* recommend chiropractic for epilepsy.\n    *   **Acupuncture:**  Some studies suggest that acupuncture may have a modest effect on seizure frequency in some individuals. However, the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed.  If you are interested in trying acupuncture, ensure the practitioner is licensed and experienced in treating neurological conditions, and *inform your neurologist.* It's vital that it's used *in conjunction with* your prescribed medical treatment, *not* as a replacement.\n\n**Important Considerations When Evaluating Alternative Therapies:**\n\n*   **Scientific Evidence:** Prioritize treatments that have been studied scientifically and shown to be effective and safe. Be wary of anecdotal claims or treatments that lack rigorous research.\n*   **Safety:** Ensure any alternative therapy is safe for you, given your medical history and current medications. Discuss potential risks and side effects with your doctor.\n*   **Integration with Medical Care:** Alternative therapies should be used *in conjunction with*, not *instead of*, your prescribed medical treatment.\n*   **Realistic Expectations:** Be realistic about the potential benefits of alternative therapies. They may not completely eliminate seizures, but they might help reduce frequency or severity in some individuals.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Discussion with Your Neurologist:** Schedule a detailed appointment with your neurologist to discuss all of these potential alternative options. Be prepared to ask questions, express your concerns, and actively participate in the decision-making process.\n2.  **Second Opinion (Optional):** If you're unsure about your neurologist's recommendations, consider seeking a second opinion from another epilepsy specialist.\n3.  **Research:**  Do your own research on any potential treatments, but always rely on reputable sources and discuss your findings with your doctor.\n4.  **Document Everything:** Keep a seizure diary to track seizure frequency, triggers, and any changes you make to your treatment regimen. This information will be valuable for your neurologist.\n\nUltimately, finding the right approach to managing refractory epilepsy is a process of exploration and collaboration between you and your medical team. Be patient, persistent, and proactive in your care. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "I've been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in two session, I stopped the first time due to cognitive side effects. However I started it again and I'm perplexed. I've always had intense headaches post ECT and during the first session I had intense deja vu experiences 2-10 times per day, this after about 1,5 months lowered to 3 times per week but up to 10 times a day. With this I developed difficulties placing people I've recently met, when I had gotten to know a face something in me just told me that I had known them since long. This time around, everyone I meet I recognise. Yesterday I was hours away from my hometown, and somehow I only met people I knew...but no one said hello...Anyone know information about this occurrence and whether it's a neurological concern or just a temporary side effect? My ECT-nurse had never heard of it before.Info: Male, 24 y/o, Caucasian, mucho depressed, no medications only ECT.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing some unusual and distressing cognitive side effects from ECT, and it's understandable that you're concerned. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on and why it's important to discuss this further with your medical team:\n\n**Possible Explanations for Your Experiences:**\n\n*   **Cognitive Disorientation and False Recognition:** ECT can temporarily disrupt normal brain function, leading to disorientation and confusion. This can sometimes manifest as feelings of familiarity (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) or false recognition (believing you know people you don't).\n\n*   **Memory Alterations:** ECT is known to affect memory, both retrograde (past memories) and anterograde (forming new memories). In your case, the experience of suddenly \"knowing\" people you just met could be related to memory distortions or a sense of familiarity that is not based on actual memory.\n\n*   **Altered Perception:** ECT can affect perception in various ways. The experience of only encountering familiar faces in an unfamiliar place could be a perceptual distortion related to the treatment.\n\n*   **Neurological Effects:** While less common, ECT can potentially have more specific neurological effects, particularly with repeated treatments. It's important to rule out any underlying neurological causes for these symptoms.\n\n*   **Psychological Factors:** Depression itself can sometimes affect perception and cognition. It's possible that your underlying depression is interacting with the effects of ECT to produce these unique experiences.\n\n**Why It's Important to Consult Your Medical Team:**\n\n1.  **Severity and Impact:** The cognitive side effects you're describing sound significant and are impacting your daily life. It's crucial to inform your doctor about the intensity, frequency, and nature of these experiences.\n\n2.  **Differential Diagnosis:** It's important to determine if these symptoms are solely due to ECT or if there might be other underlying medical or psychological factors contributing to them. A thorough assessment by a qualified medical professional is necessary.\n\n3.  **Treatment Adjustment:** Depending on the assessment, your psychiatrist may consider adjusting the ECT parameters (e.g., electrode placement, stimulus intensity, frequency of treatments) to minimize cognitive side effects. In some cases, alternative treatment options may need to be explored.\n\n4.  **Neurological Evaluation:** If the symptoms are severe, persistent, or unusual, your doctor may recommend a neurological evaluation to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. This may involve imaging studies (e.g., MRI, CT scan) or other diagnostic tests.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Document Your Symptoms:** Keep a detailed record of the symptoms you're experiencing, including when they occur, how long they last, and any associated factors. This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n*   **Contact Your Psychiatrist Immediately:** Explain your symptoms in detail to your psychiatrist and express your concerns. Do not hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed.\n*   **Consider a Neurological Consultation:** If your psychiatrist is unable to determine the cause of your symptoms, ask for a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation.\n*   **Maintain Open Communication:** Continue to communicate openly with your medical team throughout the course of your treatment.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "35 yo female with history of migraines as a child. MRI, ekg totally clear.Fainted a few times which caused a visit to a neurologist who was quick to diagnose with epilepsy. No longer loosing consciousness but symptoms are still present.    Wave of \u201cfeeling ill\u201d usually nauseous    Followed by involuntary grimacing (as if I sucked on a lemon)    Slurred or slow speech 80% of the time    Feels like my brain is swollen - but only the part of my forehead    Sometimes itchy scalp    After the episode I feel like I was hit by a truck for the next few hoursDoes this sound like a seizure? Could it be something else?I refuse to take anti seizure meds without being confident and the lack of proof makes me weary of doctors who are quick to prescribe such strong meds.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're hesitant to start anti-seizure medication without more certainty, especially given the history of normal tests. Let's break down your symptoms and consider the possibilities.\n\n**Why a Seizure is Possible, but Not Definite:**\n\n*   **History of Migraines:** Migraines and epilepsy have some overlap, and a history of migraines, even in childhood, can sometimes be relevant.\n*   **Involuntary Grimacing:** This could potentially be a type of focal motor seizure activity.\n*   **Slurred or Slow Speech:** Again, could be a seizure manifestation impacting speech centers.\n*   **Post-Episode Fatigue:** The \"hit by a truck\" feeling is common after seizures (called the postictal period).\n\n**Why It Might Be Something Else (and reasons to be skeptical of a quick epilepsy diagnosis):**\n\n*   **Normal MRI and EKG:** These tests rule out many structural and electrical causes of seizures. While they don't *exclude* epilepsy, they make it less likely.\n*   **Wave of \"Feeling Ill\" and Nausea:** This could be a migraine aura, vasovagal syncope, or related to other conditions.\n*   **\"Brain Swollen\" Sensation:** This is a subjective feeling and not typically a seizure symptom. It could relate to tension headaches, sinus pressure, or other sensations.\n*   **Itchy Scalp:** Not a typical seizure symptom, more suggestive of dermatological issues, stress, or other factors.\n*   **Resolution of Loss of Consciousness:** The fainting episodes could be a separate issue (like vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension) and not necessarily related to the current symptoms. The presence of fainting doesn't automatically mean the current symptoms are seizures.\n*   **Lack of Evidence:** Your hesitation is valid. Diagnosing epilepsy solely on clinical presentation without supportive EEG findings can be tricky.\n\n**Other Possibilities to Explore:**\n\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Some migraines don't present with typical headaches but with neurological symptoms (aura without headache).\n*   **Vestibular Migraine:** Can cause dizziness, nausea, and imbalance, sometimes with headache or other neurological symptoms.\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This condition involves neurological symptoms that are not caused by structural damage or disease in the brain, but rather by problems with how the brain functions. Symptoms can be quite varied and can sometimes mimic seizures.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope/Orthostatic Hypotension:** These conditions can cause fainting and sometimes pre-syncopal symptoms like nausea and lightheadedness.\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Disorder:** Anxiety can sometimes manifest in unusual physical symptoms.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** Could any medications you are taking be contributing to these symptoms?\n*   **Metabolic Issues:** Although less likely with a clear EKG, consider investigating metabolic imbalances.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Get a Second Neurological Opinion:** This is crucial. Find a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy *and* is willing to consider alternative diagnoses.\n\n2.  **Prolonged EEG Monitoring:** A standard EEG is often too short to catch abnormalities. Ask about:\n    *   **Ambulatory EEG:** You wear the EEG device for several days, capturing activity during your usual routines.\n    *   **Video EEG Monitoring:** You are admitted to the hospital for continuous EEG and video recording, especially if you can try to trigger an episode while monitored.\n\n3.  **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Keep a very detailed record of your symptoms, including:\n    *   Time of day\n    *   What you were doing before the episode\n    *   Specific symptoms in order\n    *   Duration of each symptom\n    *   Triggers you suspect (stress, sleep deprivation, certain foods, etc.)\n    *   What helps to alleviate the symptoms\n\n4.  **Consider a Trial of Migraine Treatment:** Under the guidance of a neurologist, you could try a migraine-specific medication (like a triptan or CGRP inhibitor) to see if it alleviates your symptoms. If it does, it strengthens the argument for a migraine variant.\n\n5.  **Explore Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) Evaluation:** If the EEGs are consistently normal, discuss the possibility of FND with your neurologist. FND is a diagnosis of exclusion (meaning other causes need to be ruled out first), but it's important to consider. If FND is suspected, referral to a specialist familiar with FND and its treatment is appropriate.\n\n6.  **Discuss Your Concerns Openly:** Clearly communicate your reservations about anti-seizure medication with any neurologist you see. They should be willing to explain their reasoning and address your concerns.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Treat:** Do not start or stop any medications without consulting a doctor.\n*   **Safety:** If you are experiencing symptoms that could be seizures, take precautions to protect yourself from injury (e.g., avoid driving, swimming alone, or operating heavy machinery).\n\n**In summary,** your concerns are valid. Your symptoms could potentially be seizures, but other conditions are also possible. Pursue further testing, seek a second opinion, and maintain open communication with your healthcare providers. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and ask questions until you feel comfortable with the diagnosis and treatment plan.\n"

    "question": "i\u2019m 18 years old, 5\u20193, i don\u2019t take any medications, i vape and smoke weed. i do cocaine, so i was driving and i felt a weird like strain in my neck on the left side, then the left side of my face went numb. my tongue went numb and my left eye felt weird. my arm went numb too. then i pulled over and my hearing started to fade. my vision started to go black and i passed out. when i was unconscious it felt very euphoric and safe, it felt like i died. and then i woke up suddenly and took a breath and i had pissed myself. my friend with me said it looked like i was having a seizure but i had never had a seizure before. while i was at the doctor my blood sugar was normal but my blood pressure was low, my ekg was normal, the doctors took blood and said nothing was wrong. what do you guys think is wrong with me",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a very serious and frightening experience, and I understand your concern.  It's good that you sought medical attention, but the fact that they didn't find anything definitive on the initial tests doesn't mean there's nothing wrong. Based on your description, here's a breakdown of potential concerns and why you should continue to seek thorough medical evaluation:\n\n**Why This Needs Urgent Attention:**\n\n*   **Loss of Consciousness:**  Passing out is never normal and indicates a disruption in brain function, blood flow, or both.\n*   **Neurological Symptoms:**  The sudden numbness on one side of your face, tongue, and arm, coupled with vision and hearing changes, are highly concerning for a neurological event.\n*   **Possible Seizure Activity:**  Your friend's observation of seizure-like activity, even if you don't recall it, is important.\n*   **Bowel/Bladder Incontinence:** Losing control of your bladder (pissing yourself) during the episode suggests a significant neurological event or loss of consciousness.\n*   **Drug Use:** Your admitted use of cocaine, weed, and vaping significantly increases the risk of several serious medical conditions.\n*   **Low Blood Pressure:** While it could be a one-time occurrence, low blood pressure, in conjunction with these other symptoms, could indicate an underlying issue.\n\n**Possible Causes (Given Your Description):**\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke:** The sudden onset of neurological symptoms (numbness, vision changes, etc.) strongly suggests a TIA or stroke. A TIA is a \"mini-stroke\" where blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked. A stroke is when blood flow is blocked for longer, causing permanent damage. *Cocaine use is a major risk factor for both.* Even if your initial EKG and blood work were normal, a stroke can sometimes be missed in the early stages. You would require an MRI or CT scan of the brain to rule this out.\n*   **Seizure:** While you've never had one before, drug use and other underlying conditions can trigger a first-time seizure. The loss of consciousness, possible convulsions, and incontinence are all consistent with a seizure. However, an EEG is typically needed to confirm a seizure disorder.\n*   **Cardiac Arrhythmia:** An abnormal heart rhythm could lead to a temporary drop in blood flow to the brain, causing loss of consciousness and potentially neurological symptoms. An EKG doesn't always catch intermittent arrhythmias, so further cardiac monitoring might be necessary.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope (with atypical presentation):** This is a fancy term for fainting. It happens when your body overreacts to certain triggers (like stress, pain, or standing for a long time), causing your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly. While it CAN explain the loss of consciousness, the one-sided numbness and other neurological symptoms are atypical and less likely to be solely explained by syncope.\n*   **Drug-Induced Event:** Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that can have profound effects on the cardiovascular and neurological systems. It can cause:\n    *   **Vasospasm:**  Narrowing of blood vessels in the brain or heart, leading to decreased blood flow.\n    *   **Arrhythmias:** Irregular heart rhythms.\n    *   **Seizures:**\n    *   **Stroke/TIA:**\n    *   **Exacerbation of Underlying Conditions:** It could trigger or worsen a pre-existing condition you're unaware of.\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** While less likely given the sudden onset and loss of consciousness, some migraines can cause neurological symptoms like numbness and vision changes (aura). However, they don't usually cause loss of consciousness or incontinence.\n*   **Underlying Heart Condition:** Certain heart conditions (like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can cause sudden drops in blood pressure and loss of consciousness, especially with exertion or drug use.\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n\n1.  **Be Honest with Your Doctors:**  It is essential to be completely honest with your doctors about your drug use, vaping, and smoking. They need this information to accurately assess your risk factors and make the correct diagnosis. They are not there to judge you, but to help you.\n2.  **Seek a Second Opinion/Further Evaluation:** Given the concerning nature of your symptoms and the lack of a clear diagnosis, I strongly recommend seeking a second opinion from a neurologist and/or a cardiologist.\n3.  **Specific Tests to Consider:** Ask your doctors about these tests:\n    *   **MRI or CT Scan of the Brain:** To rule out stroke or other brain abnormalities.\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To check for seizure activity.\n    *   **Cardiac Monitoring (Holter Monitor or Event Monitor):** To detect any heart rhythm abnormalities.\n    *   **Echocardiogram:** To assess the structure and function of your heart.\n    *   **Toxicology Screen:** To confirm the presence of drugs in your system and rule out other substances.\n4.  **Stop Using Drugs and Vaping Immediately:** This is crucial for your health and safety. The substances you're using significantly increase your risk of serious medical problems.\n5.  **Follow Up:**  Keep all follow-up appointments with your doctors and report any new or worsening symptoms immediately.\n6.  **Consider Addiction Counseling:** If you are struggling to stop using drugs, seek professional help from a qualified addiction counselor or therapist.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Euphoria During Unconsciousness:** This is not necessarily indicative of anything specific.  It could be related to the neurological event itself or even a psychological response to a stressful situation.\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's important to let the medical professionals determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI Chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "18M I think it might be a form of seizure or epilepsy... I will try to be conecentrating on something and then all of a sudden i lose concentration, and when i realize and try to focus again my whole body will twitch. The twitch lasts just a second. Let me inform you that this has led to a seizure only once before (for the last 10 years) and the doctors said it was from dehydration. But the twitching won't stop, any clue what it is? It doesn't cause any pain or fatigue afterwards, just a little stress that it could have been a serious seizure like before. I don't know its happening until afterwards, and it happens everytime i try to re-focus.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these twitches, especially given your history of a seizure and the doctor's previous assessment linking it to dehydration. While I can't provide a diagnosis, I can offer some possible explanations and strongly advise you to follow up with a doctor.\n\nHere's a breakdown of things to consider:\n\n*   **Possible Causes:**\n    *   **Myoclonic Jerks:** These are sudden, brief, involuntary muscle contractions, like a twitch. They can be normal (like when you're falling asleep) or associated with underlying medical conditions.\n    *   **Focal Seizures:** These seizures start in one area of the brain. Sometimes, they can involve motor symptoms like twitching or jerking in a specific body part. The fact that the twitching seems linked to focusing and re-focusing could be relevant.\n    *   **Benign Fasciculations:** These are random muscle twitches that can happen for a variety of reasons, including stress, caffeine, or electrolyte imbalances. However, they usually aren't related to concentration.\n    *   **Essential Tremor:** While tremors are usually rhythmic shaking, sometimes they can manifest as jerks. This is less likely given your description.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:** If you're taking any medications (even over-the-counter), they could be contributing.\n    *   **Anxiety/Stress:** Sometimes, anxiety or stress can manifest physically as muscle twitches.\n    *   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** As your doctor mentioned dehydration previously, it could also be caused by an electrolyte imbalance.\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Lack of adequate sleep can contribute to neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Other Neurological Conditions:** Less likely, but these symptoms could be related to another underlying neurological issue.\n\n*   **Importance of Medical Evaluation:**\n    *   **Accurate Diagnosis:** A doctor can perform a neurological exam, take a detailed medical history, and order tests (like an EEG \u2013 electroencephalogram, or an MRI of the brain) to determine the cause of your twitches.\n    *   **Ruling Out Serious Conditions:** It's essential to rule out any serious underlying neurological conditions.\n    *   **Appropriate Treatment:** Depending on the cause, treatment options may include medication, lifestyle changes (like stress management or ensuring adequate hydration and sleep), or physical therapy.\n\n*   **What to Tell Your Doctor:** Be as detailed as possible when describing your symptoms. This includes:\n    *   How often the twitches occur.\n    *   What triggers them (e.g., focusing/re-focusing).\n    *   The location of the twitch (e.g., entire body, specific body part).\n    *   The duration of the twitch.\n    *   Any associated symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, confusion, tingling, numbness).\n    *   Your medical history (including any past seizures, medications, and other medical conditions).\n    *   Your family history of neurological disorders.\n    *   Your typical daily routine (including sleep patterns, diet, and stress levels).\n\n*   **What to Do in the Meantime:**\n    *   **Hydration:** Make sure you are drinking enough water throughout the day.\n    *   **Sleep:** Prioritize getting enough sleep.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n    *   **Caffeine and Alcohol:** Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol, as these can sometimes trigger neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Keep a Log:** Start keeping a log of when the twitches occur, what you were doing at the time, and any other relevant details. This information can be helpful for your doctor.\n    *   **Avoid Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery:** If you are concerned that the twitches could impair your ability to drive or operate heavy machinery, avoid doing so until you have been evaluated by a doctor.\n\n**The most important step is to consult with a doctor (preferably a neurologist) to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Do not self-diagnose or self-treat.**\n"

    "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is definitely something that warrants further investigation by a medical professional. While your initial thought of sleepwalking related to anxiety is understandable, the specific details you've provided raise enough red flags to warrant a medical evaluation. Here's a breakdown of why and what to consider:\n\n**Why a Medical Evaluation is Necessary:**\n\n*   **Sudden Onset and Pattern:** The sudden onset of these complex episodes after years of normal sleep is concerning. While anxiety can manifest in various ways, this specific pattern is not typical of simple anxiety-related sleepwalking.\n*   **Presence During Episodes:** The fact that she is somewhat aware of her surroundings and able to interact with you during the episodes, yet also seems driven by an internal compulsion, is unusual.\n*   **Specific Requests and Actions:** The specific, urgent requests (blue marker, pyramid blanket) and the associated relief upon completion suggest an obsessive or compulsive element that goes beyond typical sleepwalking.\n*   **Visual Hallucinations/Distortions:** Her description of seeing things that aren't right (door frame size, clones) points towards potential perceptual disturbances that need to be investigated. Hallucinations are not typical of simple sleepwalking or night terrors.\n*   **Post-Episode Twitching:** The twitching and shaking after the episode, followed by rapid return to sleep, could be significant.\n*   **Memory of Episodes:** The fact that she remembers the episodes in detail the next morning is *very* unusual for typical sleepwalking or night terrors. In those cases, the individual usually has little to no memory of the event.\n\n**Possible Considerations & Questions to Explore with a Doctor:**\n\nGiven your daughter's symptoms, here are some possibilities a doctor may consider, and some questions you can ask them:\n\n1.  **Seizure Activity (Nocturnal Seizures):**\n    *   *Why it's a possibility:* Certain types of seizures, particularly those originating in the frontal lobe, can manifest with complex behaviors, automatisms (repetitive movements), and altered awareness. The post-episode twitching and the fact that she quickly returns to sleep could be seizure-related. The hallucinations could be a form of aura.\n    *   *Questions to ask the doctor:* \"Could this be a type of seizure, and what kind of testing would be necessary to rule that out?\" (Specifically mention nocturnal seizures.) \"Would an EEG, especially a sleep-deprived EEG, be helpful?\"\n\n2.  **Parasomnia Overlap Disorder:**\n   * *Why it's a possibility:* This is a broad term for the co-occurrence of different sleep disorders (like sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder) or a mix of features that don't neatly fit one diagnosis.\n    *   *Questions to ask the doctor:* \"Could she have more than one sleep-related disorder happening simultaneously?\" \"Is it possible for her to have traits of different types of sleepwalking?\"\n\n3.  **Complex Sleepwalking/Confusional Arousals:**\n    *   *Why it's a possibility:* While less likely given the specific details, a very complex and atypical form of sleepwalking or confusional arousal could be considered. However, the memory of the events is very atypical for this.\n    *   *Questions to ask the doctor:* \"Is it possible this is a very unusual manifestation of sleepwalking, even with the memory component?\"\n\n4.  **Psychological/Psychiatric Factors:**\n    *   *Why it's a possibility:* While the physical symptoms are prominent, psychological factors still need to be considered.\n    *   *Questions to ask the doctor:* \"Could anxiety or other psychological factors be contributing to these episodes, and how can we differentiate between a primary psychological cause and a neurological one?\"\n\n5.  **Post-Infectious/Autoimmune Considerations:**\n    *   *Why it's a possibility:* The recent UTI and antibiotic use, along with the sudden onset of these episodes, could raise the possibility of a post-infectious process affecting the brain (though this is less likely).\n    *   *Questions to ask the doctor:* \"Is there any possibility that the recent UTI or antibiotic use could be related to these episodes, such as an autoimmune response affecting the brain?\"\n\n6.  **Medication Side Effects:**\n    *   *Why it's a possibility:* Although she's not currently on ADHD medication, it's still important to consider any potential side effects from the previous antibiotic or any over-the-counter medications she might be taking.\n    *   *Questions to ask the doctor:* \"Could the cefixime have triggered this, even after it was stopped? Should we check for interactions with anything else she is taking?\"\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Doctor's Appointment:** The most important step is to schedule an appointment with her pediatrician or family doctor. Explain the episodes in detail, emphasizing the specific sequence, awareness, hallucinations, requests, and post-episode twitching.\n\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Log:** Continue to meticulously document each episode, including:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   Time since sleep onset\n    *   Specific behaviors in each phase\n    *   Exact words spoken\n    *   Details of the \"hallucinations\" or distortions she describes\n    *   Duration of each phase\n    *   Time to return to sleep\n    *   Any potential triggers (e.g., stress, diet, activity before bed)\n\n3.  **Consider Video Recording:** If possible and ethically appropriate, consider briefly video-recording an episode (with her knowledge and consent, if possible, and being mindful of her distress). This can be extremely helpful for the doctor to see the events firsthand.\n\n4.  **Discuss with Therapists:** Share this information with her therapists at the multidisciplinary clinic. They may have additional insights or recommendations based on their work with her.\n\n5.  **Be Prepared for Referrals:** Be prepared for the doctor to refer you to a specialist, such as a pediatric neurologist or a sleep specialist.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   This is more complex than typical anxiety-related sleepwalking.\n*   The hallucinations and memory of the events are particularly concerning.\n*   Ruling out neurological causes, especially seizures, is essential.\n\nDon't delay in seeking medical attention. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for managing any potential underlying condition. Good luck, and I hope you get answers soon!\n"

    "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. It sounds like you're in a tough spot. Your mental health is worsening, access to timely care is a challenge, and you're trying to navigate medication options with specific concerns.\n\n**Regarding Citalopram and Worsening Depression:**\n\n*   **Yes, SSRIs can, in some cases, worsen depression.** While they are designed to help, paradoxical effects can occur. It's not uncommon for someone to experience an initial improvement in anxiety, but then find their depression either doesn't improve or gets worse. This might be due to the specific way your brain responds to the medication, or it might be that the citalopram is helping the anxiety but not addressing the underlying causes of your depression. It could also be a tolerance issue, where the drug initially worked but is now less effective.\n\n**Stopping Citalopram Suddenly:**\n\n*   **Stopping citalopram abruptly is generally *not* recommended.** SSRIs can cause withdrawal symptoms (sometimes called \"discontinuation syndrome\") which can be unpleasant and, in some cases, dangerous. These symptoms can include:\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Flu-like symptoms\n    *   Insomnia\n    *   Anxiety\n    *   Nausea\n    *   Irritability\n    *   Sensory disturbances (like \"brain zaps\")\n    *   Worsening of depression or anxiety\n\n*   **However, given your situation, the risk of worsening suicidal thoughts needs to be taken very seriously.** If you are feeling actively suicidal, you need immediate help. Options include:\n    *   **Calling 999 (in the UK) or going to your nearest A&E.**  Explain that you are experiencing suicidal thoughts and are concerned about your medication.\n    *   **Calling the Samaritans.** They are available 24/7 at 116 123.\n    *   **Contacting your local crisis mental health team.**  Your GP surgery should have information on how to access them.\n\n*   **Weighing Risks and Benefits:** If you truly cannot get an appointment and your mental health is deteriorating rapidly with suicidal thoughts, *and* you have explored the above crisis options, *then* **reducing your dose slowly** might be the least bad option *until* you can get professional help.  **Do NOT stop cold turkey.**  Even a small reduction, like going from 30mg to 20mg for a few days, then 10mg, can help mitigate withdrawal symptoms.  But this should only be done as a last resort *while actively pursuing professional medical help.* This is NOT medical advice, it is harm reduction advice in a crisis.\n\n**Antidepressant Options & Considerations with Topiramate:**\n\nIt's essential to discuss these options *thoroughly* with your GP or psychiatrist. They know your medical history and can consider all the factors involved.\n\n*   **Important Considerations:**\n    *   **Past Medication Trials:** You've already tried sertraline, fluoxetine, and mirtazapine. Knowing why these didn't work (side effects, lack of efficacy) is crucial.\n    *   **Myoclonic Jerks/Epilepsy Medication:** Avoiding medications that can worsen twitching is paramount.\n    *   **Fatigue:** Avoiding sedating medications is important for your quality of life.\n    *   **Topiramate:**  Topiramate is used for epilepsy and migraine prevention, as you know.  You need to consider potential interactions and additive side effects.\n\nHere are some *potential* options to discuss with your doctor, keeping in mind this is not a substitute for a professional consultation:\n\n1.  **Switching to a Different SSRI/SNRI:**\n    *   **Venlafaxine (SNRI):**  An SNRI might be more effective for depression if the SSRI isn't working. However, it can cause withdrawal symptoms and can sometimes increase anxiety in some individuals.\n    *   **Duloxetine (SNRI):** Similar to venlafaxine.\n    *   **Escitalopram:** This is another SSRI to consider if you want to stick with this class of antidepressant.\n2.  **Adding an Augmentation Agent:**\n    *   **Bupropion (Wellbutrin):** This is a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It's generally activating and less likely to cause fatigue or weight gain.  *However, it can lower the seizure threshold, so this needs to be discussed VERY carefully with your doctor given your myoclonic jerks and topiramate use.*\n    *   **Aripiprazole (Abilify) or Quetiapine (Seroquel) - low dose:** These are atypical antipsychotics that can be used at low doses to augment antidepressants. They can have side effects, including sedation and weight gain, so this needs careful consideration.\n3.  **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):**\n    *   **Amitriptyline:**  You asked about this. While it's sometimes used for migraines, it's generally *not* a first-line antidepressant due to its side effect profile (sedation, weight gain, anticholinergic effects). Given your fatigue, this is likely not a good choice.  *Also, there can be interactions between amitriptyline and topiramate, particularly regarding cognitive side effects. They both can cause drowsiness, dizziness and confusion, so combining them may enhance these effects.* It is generally advised to avoid this combination.\n    *   **Nortriptyline:**  May be a better tolerated TCA than amitriptyline, but still carries the risk of anticholinergic effects.\n4.  **MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors):**  These are generally reserved for treatment-resistant depression due to dietary restrictions and potential for drug interactions.  They are unlikely to be a suitable option in your case.\n\n**Important Considerations for your situation:**\n\n*   **Topiramate and Antidepressants:** Topiramate can interact with some antidepressants. It can potentially reduce the effectiveness of some SSRIs and increase the risk of side effects. Your doctor will need to carefully consider these interactions.\n*   **Myoclonic Jerks/Epilepsy:** This is a critical factor in medication selection. Bupropion, as mentioned, can lower the seizure threshold.\n*   **Migraines:** While some antidepressants can help with migraines (like amitriptyline), the potential side effects and interactions need to be carefully weighed.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Getting an Appointment:** Continue to pursue a GP appointment. Explain the urgency of the situation and that you're experiencing worsening suicidal thoughts.  If your GP surgery remains difficult to access, consider:\n    *   **NHS 111:** Call 111 and explain your situation. They may be able to direct you to alternative services.\n    *   **Private GP:** If you can afford it, consider a private GP appointment for a faster consultation.\n2.  **Crisis Support:** If you feel actively suicidal, use the crisis resources mentioned above (999, A&E, Samaritans, crisis team).\n3.  **Do NOT Stop Citalopram Abruptly (Unless in a Crisis):** Unless you are in immediate danger and have no other option, *slowly* taper the dose if you feel you absolutely must reduce it before you can get help.\n4.  **Prepare for Your Appointment:**  Write down:\n    *   A detailed timeline of your symptoms and medication history.\n    *   What you've tried in the past (sertraline, fluoxetine, mirtazapine) and why they didn't work.\n    *   Your concerns about side effects (twitching, fatigue).\n    *   Your questions about alternative medications.\n5.  **Be Open and Honest:**  Tell your doctor *everything* you're experiencing, including your suicidal thoughts and your concerns about the citalopram.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  Your situation is complex and requires individualized assessment by a doctor.\n"

    "question": "Age 5 Sex male Height 40\u201d Weight40lb Racewhite Duration of complaint 20 months Location Colorado, USA Any existing relevant medical issues CP, epilepsy Current medications Generic keppra 2.5mg/ml 2x daily My 5 yo son with CP and epilepsy My kid is amazing and funny and smart. We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling this way. You've been through a traumatic experience with your son, and the fear you're experiencing is a natural response to the responsibility you feel for his well-being. It's also commendable how much you love and advocate for both your children. Let's break down your questions and explore some strategies to help you navigate this.\n\n**Understanding Breakthrough Seizures and Keppra's Long-Term Effectiveness**\n\n*   **Likelihood of Breakthrough Seizures:** There's no single answer, unfortunately. Several factors influence the likelihood of breakthrough seizures:\n    *   **Seizure Type and Epilepsy Syndrome:** Was a specific epilepsy syndrome identified after his initial generalized seizure? Some syndromes are more easily controlled than others. Focal seizures that generalize can have varying causes and prognoses.\n    *   **Brain Injury and Epilepsy:** Seizures arising from a known brain injury (like his stroke) are often more predictable and easier to control than those without a clear cause. The scar tissue from the stroke can act as a focal point for seizure activity.\n    *   **Keppra's Effectiveness Over Time:** Keppra generally remains effective for a long time in many individuals. However, its effectiveness can change due to:\n        *   **Tolerance:** While less common with Keppra than some other medications, tolerance (requiring a higher dose for the same effect) can develop over time.\n        *   **Changes in the Brain:** The brain can change over time, especially in a child. New connections, growth spurts, and other factors can influence seizure control.\n        *   **Other Illnesses:** Fevers, infections, and other illnesses can lower the seizure threshold, making breakthrough seizures more likely. This is a valid concern and one you are rightfully worried about.\n        *   **Medication Adherence:** This is unlikely given your level of concern, but it's always worth mentioning. Missed doses can significantly increase the risk of seizures.\n    *   **Triggers:** As you mentioned, fever is a known trigger. Other potential triggers can include sleep deprivation, stress, and certain foods or medications (though these are less common).\n\n    **Because of the uncertainty, it's imperative to have a thorough discussion with your son's pediatric neurologist/epileptologist.** They can provide a more personalized assessment based on his specific case, EEG results, MRI findings, and response to medication. They can also address your specific concerns about the long-term effectiveness of Keppra.\n\n**Strategies for Managing Your Anxiety and Promoting Your Son's Independence**\n\nHere's a multi-pronged approach to help you regain a sense of calm and encourage your son's development:\n\n1.  **Consult with a Mental Health Professional:**\n    *   **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for managing anxiety. It can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns and develop coping mechanisms.\n    *   **Medication:** If anxiety is significantly impacting your daily life, talk to your doctor about potential medications. Anti-anxiety medications can provide temporary relief while you work on long-term strategies in therapy.\n    *   **Support Groups:** Connecting with other parents of children with epilepsy or CP can be incredibly validating and provide a sense of community.\n\n2.  **Optimize Seizure Management:**\n    *   **Regular Neurology Appointments:** Continue regular follow-up appointments with your son's neurologist. Discuss any changes in seizure frequency, duration, or type.\n    *   **Consider Video EEG Monitoring:** A longer-term video EEG, even if just overnight, might give his neurologist better insights into his brain activity and inform treatment decisions.\n    *   **Medication Review:** Discuss potential medication adjustments with your doctor. Ensure his Keppra dose is appropriate for his weight and growth.\n    *   **Seizure Action Plan:** Ensure you have a clear and detailed seizure action plan in place, including when to administer rescue medication and when to call emergency services. Review this plan with caregivers and family members.\n\n3.  **Gradually Increase Independence:**\n    *   **Small Steps:** Start with small steps to promote independence. For example, give him more responsibility for choosing his clothes or helping with simple chores.\n    *   **Age-Appropriate Activities:** Encourage him to participate in age-appropriate activities, even with modifications as needed. Focus on his strengths and interests.\n    *   **Privacy:** Gradually increase his privacy. Start by giving him alone time in his room with the door closed for short periods, then gradually increase the duration.\n    *   **Communication:** Openly communicate with him about his epilepsy and the importance of taking medication. As he gets older, involve him in discussions with his doctors.\n\n4.  **Address COVID-19 Concerns:**\n    *   **Vaccination:** Ensure your son and all eligible family members are vaccinated against COVID-19.\n    *   **Masking:** Continue practicing appropriate masking and social distancing in public settings.\n    *   **Virtual Therapies:** Explore whether some of his therapies can be delivered virtually to minimize the risk of exposure.\n    *   **Outdoor Activities:** Find less crowded outdoor spaces for hiking and other activities. Consider going during off-peak hours.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** Work with his doctors to assess his individual risk of complications from COVID-19 and develop a plan for managing potential infections.\n\n5.  **Self-Care is Crucial:**\n    *   **Prioritize Sleep:** Make sleep a priority. When you are rested you will be able to better handle the demands of being a caregiver. If you're still struggling to sleep, talk to your doctor.\n    *   **Exercise:** Regular exercise can help reduce anxiety and improve mood.\n    *   **Hobbies:** Make time for activities you enjoy, even if it's just for a few minutes each day.\n    *   **Social Support:** Connect with friends and family members for support.\n    *   **Mindfulness:** Practice mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n\n**Regarding the Camera Monitoring:**\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that you want to monitor him, consider the long-term impact of constant surveillance on his sense of privacy and independence. Talk to his neurologist or a therapist specializing in children with chronic conditions about finding a balance between safety and autonomy. You might be able to gradually reduce the use of cameras as he gets older and more independent.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Legally Blind:** His vision impairment adds complexity. Work closely with specialists to ensure he receives the appropriate support and accommodations.\n*   **Left Hemiplegia:** Continue with physical and occupational therapy to maximize his mobility and independence.\n*   **CP:** Cerebral Palsy affects muscle tone and coordination. Continued therapy and adaptive equipment can help manage these challenges.\n*   **Twin Sister:** Be mindful of the potential for sibling rivalry and ensure that both children receive equal attention and support.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   Your feelings are valid and understandable.\n*   There are steps you can take to manage your anxiety and promote your son's independence.\n*   Communication with your son's medical team is crucial.\n*   Self-care is essential for your well-being and your ability to care for your children.\n\nRemember, you are doing a fantastic job. You are clearly a loving and devoted parent. By seeking help and implementing these strategies, you can create a fulfilling and meaningful life for your son and your entire family.\n"

    "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

    "answer": "Okay, that sounds incredibly frustrating and difficult to live with. It's completely understandable that you're feeling the way you are given the impact this has had on your life and the lack of answers you've received so far. It's good that you're continuing to advocate for yourself and seeking medical attention. Here's a breakdown of potential areas to explore with your doctor, based on your description:\n\n**1. The TMJ Connection:**\n\n*   **Specifically describe the maneuver:** You've already identified this as a key piece of the puzzle. Be *very* precise with your doctor. Don't just say \"I mess with my TMJ.\" Show them *exactly* where you're pushing, the angle, the pressure, and the sensations you feel (warmth, blood flow). The detail is critical here.\n*   **Potential Explanations (linked to TMJ):**\n    *   **Musculoskeletal Issues:** While previous chiropractors haven't been successful, the consistent partial relief from your TMJ manipulation suggests a musculoskeletal component. It's possible that specific muscles around the TMJ, skull base, or upper neck are compressing nerves or blood vessels. Muscles like the medial and lateral pterygoids, temporalis, or even the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) could be involved.\n    *   **TMJ Dysfunction Compressing Structures:** There could be abnormal positioning of the TMJ joint itself that, when you manipulate it, releases pressure on surrounding structures.\n    *   **Vascular Compression:** This is exactly what you suspect. A major artery (internal or external carotid artery branches) or vein might be getting compressed or impinged upon near the TMJ. Your manipulation may briefly alleviate this compression. This is harder to diagnose and might not show up on standard MRI/MRA.\n    *   **Nerve Irritation:** The trigeminal nerve (CN V), which has branches very close to the TMJ, provides sensation to the face and has motor function for chewing. Irritation or compression of this nerve could cause referred sensations and potentially contribute to your symptoms.\n*   **What to ask your doctor to consider (TMJ):**\n    *   A thorough TMJ examination by a specialist (oral surgeon, or a dentist with specific TMJ training). This should include palpation, range of motion assessment, and possibly imaging focused on the TMJ.\n    *   Referral to a physical therapist with expertise in TMJ disorders and cervicogenic headaches (headaches originating from the neck).\n    *   The possibility of more specialized TMJ imaging (cone-beam CT scan) to better visualize the joint and surrounding structures.\n\n**2. Vascular Considerations:**\n\n*   **Why your initial imaging might be insufficient:** A standard MRI/MRA may not capture subtle vascular abnormalities, particularly if they are positional (only present when you move your head or neck in certain ways). It's also possible the imaging quality wasn't high enough to detect small issues.\n*   **Potential Vascular Issues:**\n    *   **Arterial Dissection:** A small tear in the wall of an artery in the neck (like the carotid or vertebral arteries) can cause a variety of neurological symptoms. It's unlikely given your symptom duration, but needs to be ruled out.\n    *   **Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency (VBI):** This involves reduced blood flow in the vertebral arteries (which supply the back of the brain). Certain head positions can temporarily compromise these arteries. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, and other neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Eagle Syndrome:** This is a rare condition where an elongated styloid process (a bony projection near the base of the skull) or calcified stylohyoid ligament irritates nearby structures, including nerves and blood vessels.\n    *   **Subclavian Steal Syndrome:** A rare condition, but possible. Blood is \"stolen\" from the brain circulation to supply the arm due to a blockage or narrowing in the subclavian artery. This might manifest with certain arm movements.\n*   **What to ask your doctor to consider (Vascular):**\n    *   Specifically mention your concern about a vascular issue, especially related to blood flow near the TMJ.\n    *   Ask about the possibility of a **dynamic MRA** (MRA performed with your head in different positions) to see if any vascular compression occurs with movement.\n    *   Inquire about a **Doppler ultrasound** of the carotid and vertebral arteries to assess blood flow.\n    *   Discuss the possibility of referral to a vascular specialist (neurologist or vascular surgeon).\n\n**3. Neurological Considerations:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** Although your description doesn't perfectly fit typical seizures, some subtle seizure types (absence seizures, complex partial seizures) can cause brief periods of altered awareness.\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Some types of migraine can cause neurological symptoms without head pain.\n*   **Deafferentation Pain:** This refers to pain that is caused by damage to or malfunction of the nervous system. Your description of sensation of blood flow may represent the brain's misinterpretation of neural signals.\n*   **What to ask your doctor to consider (Neurological):**\n    *   Discuss the possibility of an EEG (electroencephalogram) to rule out seizure activity.\n    *   Ask for a referral to a neurologist specializing in headache disorders.\n    *   Inquire about further neurological evaluation to assess nerve function and rule out other neurological conditions.\n\n**4. Other Considerations:**\n\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:** The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. Dysfunction can cause a wide range of symptoms, including dizziness, lightheadedness, and cognitive difficulties.\n*   **Cervical Instability:** Although your cervical MRI was normal, subtle instability in the upper cervical spine (neck) can irritate the spinal cord or surrounding nerves.\n*   **Medication Side Effects/Withdrawal:** Even if antidepressants and ADD medications didn't solve the problem, stopping them could potentially contribute to symptoms (although unlikely after this long).\n\n**Important Advice:**\n\n*   **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed log of your symptoms, triggers, and what provides relief (including the TMJ manipulation). This will be invaluable to your doctor.\n*   **Be Persistent:** Don't give up. It may take multiple appointments and specialists to find the answer.\n*   **Seek a Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with your doctor's explanations or treatment plan, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion.\n*   **Mental Health Support:** Continue to seek mental health support. Dealing with chronic and unexplained medical issues is incredibly stressful, and having a therapist can help you cope. Suicidal thoughts are serious, so please reach out for help if you're experiencing them. (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988).\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** You know your body best. Trust your instincts and don't let anyone dismiss your symptoms.\n\n**What to say to your doctor this week:**\n\n1.  \"I've been experiencing this [describe symptoms] for a long time, and it's significantly impacting my life. I'm concerned about [Summarize your main concern, vascular/TMJ related, neurological, etc.]. \"\n2.  \"I've found that [Describe your TMJ manipulation] provides temporary relief. This makes me think there might be a connection to the TMJ or the blood vessels/nerves in that area.\"\n3.  \"I've had an MRI and MRA of my head and cervical spine, but I'm wondering if those tests were sensitive enough to detect [Specific concerns like vascular compression or subtle structural abnormalities].\"\n4.  \"I'd like to explore the possibility of [Specific tests/referrals you want, like a dynamic MRA, TMJ specialist, neurologist].\"\n5.  \"I want to rule out [Specific conditions you're concerned about, like vertebrobasilar insufficiency or Eagle syndrome].\"\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that there are many, many possibilities, and a process of elimination by getting referred and trying different things is how you can find out the root cause. I hope this detailed information helps you advocate for yourself and find some answers. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Female, 40, has a history of seizures but not since 2011, after surgery,  Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex set of questions, and it's important to remember I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace a consultation with a qualified neurologist. Given your history of seizures, it's *crucial* you discuss these specific concerns with your doctor.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your questions, along with some general information:\n\n**1. Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head?**\n\n*   **Yes, absolutely.**  Seizures originate in the brain, so it's very common to experience sensations localized to the head.  How someone *feels* a seizure is highly variable and depends on the seizure type and the area of the brain involved.\n*   **Possible sensations in the head might include:**\n    *   A rising sensation (like something moving upward in the head)\n    *   A strange taste or smell\n    *   Dizziness or vertigo\n    *   Headache (before, during, or after)\n    *   Visual disturbances (flashing lights, blurry vision)\n    *   Auditory hallucinations (ringing, buzzing, voices)\n    *   A feeling of deja vu or jamais vu (feeling like you've experienced something before or feeling that the familiar seems strange).\n    *   A feeling of intense fear, anxiety, or a sense of impending doom.\n    *   A feeling of detachment or unreality\n    *   A sudden rush of thoughts or an inability to think clearly\n    *   Muscle twitches or jerks that start locally.\n*   The idea that it *always* goes \"from your head to other parts of your body\" is an oversimplification.  Some seizures remain localized (focal seizures without impaired awareness). Some begin locally and then spread.  Some (generalized seizures) involve the entire brain from the outset.\n*   Because the brain is the center of sensation, a change in brain wave activities can certainly be felt.\n\n**2. Why don't all seizures show up on EEG?**\n\n*   **Several reasons:**\n    *   **Seizure Origin:** The seizure focus (where it starts) might be deep within the brain, making it difficult for scalp EEG electrodes to pick up the abnormal electrical activity.\n    *   **Brief Seizures:**  If the seizure is very short, the EEG might not capture it, especially during a routine EEG, which is usually only 20-30 minutes long.\n    *   **Interictal Activity:** The EEG is often looking for \"interictal\" activity (abnormal brain waves between seizures) which isn't always present, even in people with epilepsy. Some people have normal EEGs between seizures.\n    *   **EEG Type:** A routine EEG has limitations.  Ambulatory EEGs (continuous monitoring over 24-72 hours or longer) have a better chance of capturing seizure activity. Video EEG monitoring (VEEG), which combines EEG with video recording, is even more effective because it allows doctors to correlate EEG changes with observable behaviors.\n    *   **Electrode Placement:**  Standard electrode placement might not be optimal for detecting activity in certain brain regions.\n    *   **Muscle artifact**: Movement of the muscles of the head, face and neck can sometimes obscure or mimic seizure activity, causing a false negative result.\n    *   **Medication:** Anti-seizure medications may make it more difficult to detect seizures on an EEG.\n\n**3. Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one?**\n\n*   **Yes, this is possible, though potentially confusing.**\n*   **Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness:** In some focal seizures, awareness is impaired or lost. You might not remember the seizure itself but later experience postictal symptoms (symptoms after a seizure) like confusion, headache, fatigue, or muscle soreness.  Someone else might observe the seizure activity, even if you don't recall it.\n*   **Subclinical Seizures:** Some seizures, particularly in critically ill patients, can be purely electrical with no outward clinical manifestations.  These are called subclinical seizures and are only detectable on EEG.  While less likely in your case given your history, it's a possibility.\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Attacks:**  Anxiety or panic attacks can sometimes mimic seizure symptoms. The feeling of \"having had a seizure\" might actually be related to a panic episode.\n*   **Postictal Phenomena:** The \"feeling like you had one\" could be lingering postictal effects from a previous seizure, even if that seizure was mild or occurred some time ago.\n*   **Migraine Aura:**  Migraines can sometimes cause neurological symptoms that can be confused with seizures.\n*   **Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES):**  These events look like seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  They are often related to psychological factors.  It is important to investigate these if they are suspected.\n\n**Finding More Information:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:**  A great resource.  Look for sections on seizure types, diagnosis, and EEG.  [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n*   **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS):**  [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/)  Search for \"seizures\" or \"epilepsy.\"\n*   **Your Neurologist's Office:** Ask for recommended reading materials or websites.\n\n**Recommendations for You:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Neurologist IMMEDIATELY:** Given your history, any new or unusual sensations or feelings that might be related to seizure activity require prompt evaluation.  Do not delay.\n2.  **Detailed Symptom Journal:**  Keep a detailed journal of what you're experiencing. Note the specific sensations, time of day, duration, any triggers you can identify, and any postictal symptoms. This will be extremely helpful for your doctor.\n3.  **Discuss EEG Options:**  Talk to your doctor about whether further EEG testing is warranted, such as an ambulatory EEG or VEEG.\n4.  **Medication Review:**  Ensure your current medications are appropriate and that you are taking them as prescribed.\n5.  **Lifestyle Factors:** Discuss lifestyle factors with your doctor, such as sleep, stress management, and alcohol consumption, as these can sometimes influence seizure activity.\n\nAgain, I cannot provide medical advice. Your neurologist is the best person to address your specific concerns and determine the appropriate course of action.\n"

    "question": "Hey all, I am a 30 yo white male. I am currently 270 pounds and 5'9. Active and fairly healthy. Meds: Keppra (1000mg x2 daily, Prozac 40mg 1x Daily, Clonazepam .5mg x2 daily, Meloxicam 15mg 1x daily, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin C Supplements) I had mono when i was 17 that developed into GBS. I had weakness, druken gate, and slurred speech and my main symptoms. Symptoms resolved in approx. 6 months and i was going back to normal. Shortly there after i started with seizures, one in November 2009, again in February 2010. I have been on Keppra since and been seizure free. I also have auto immune disease. One diagnosed, Hidradenitis Supperativa (doing well), and one undiagnosed. The undiagnosed one is more recently been bothering me.. i have Episcleritis and joint pain.. High ESR and CRP in the blood. I am worried about covid and want the vax but am afraid because i had a neurological reaction to the flu shot after my GBS. My Neurologist is insisting i get the vax and im talking to my Rheumi tomorrow. Is there anybody who can give me insight on what i should consider? Thank you!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your concerns and what factors you should consider regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, given your medical history. It's important to remember that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  This information is for educational purposes only and is intended to facilitate a discussion with your doctors.\n\n**Key Considerations Based on Your Medical History:**\n\n1.  **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) History:** This is the most significant factor influencing your concerns.  While GBS is rare after vaccination, it is a known, though very rare, possible side effect of some vaccines, including influenza and, in some cases, COVID-19 vaccines (particularly the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine).  Your previous neurological reaction to the flu shot is understandable reason for your concern.\n2.  **Seizure Disorder:** Keppra is controlling your seizures, which is positive.  However, it's essential to ensure that any potential vaccine side effects (e.g., fever) are managed to minimize the risk of breakthrough seizures. Most COVID-19 vaccinations do not have interactions with seizure medications, so it shouldn't affect your medication.\n3.  **Autoimmune Disease (Hidradenitis Suppurativa and Undiagnosed):** Autoimmune conditions can sometimes lead to a heightened immune response after vaccination. The COVID-19 vaccine may cause flare ups of autoimmune diseases.\n4.  **Medications:**\n    *   **Keppra, Prozac, Clonazepam, Meloxicam, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin C:**  These medications generally don't have significant contraindications with COVID-19 vaccines. However, your doctors will need to consider the overall picture.\n    *   **Meloxicam:** As an NSAID, it can help manage fever and pain after vaccination, if needed.\n\n5.  **Age and Weight:** You're in a higher-risk group for severe COVID-19 due to your age (30) and weight (270 lbs, indicating obesity). This is a crucial factor when weighing the risks and benefits.\n\n6.  **High ESR and CRP:**  Elevated inflammatory markers suggest ongoing autoimmune activity, which could potentially influence your response to the vaccine.\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Neurologist and Rheumatologist:**\n\n*   **COVID-19 Risk vs. Vaccine Risk:**  Have a detailed discussion about your individual risk of severe COVID-19 given your age, weight, underlying conditions, and the current prevalence of COVID-19 in your community.  Weigh this against the potential (and likely very low) risk of a GBS relapse or other adverse reaction to the vaccine.\n*   **Vaccine Type:**  Discuss which vaccine type is most suitable for you.  Generally, the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) have shown a lower association with GBS compared to the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine. This is a crucial point for your doctors to assess.\n*   **Pre-Vaccination Assessment:**  Ask if any specific pre-vaccination tests or monitoring are recommended, given your autoimmune markers and history.\n*   **Post-Vaccination Monitoring and Management:**  Develop a plan for managing potential side effects, especially fever, and how to monitor for any neurological symptoms suggestive of GBS recurrence.  Have a clear contact plan with your doctors.\n*   **Alternative Vaccination Strategies:**  In rare cases, and only under strict medical supervision, some individuals with a history of severe vaccine reactions might explore a fractional dosing approach (smaller doses) or other modified vaccination schedules. This is **not** a standard recommendation and would only be considered in exceptional circumstances.\n*   **Immunoglobulin (IVIg) or Plasma Exchange Availability:**  In the unlikely event of a GBS relapse, ensure your doctors have a plan in place for accessing IVIg or plasma exchange treatment quickly.\n*   **Shared Decision-Making:**  Emphasize that you want to be an active participant in the decision-making process.  Your concerns are valid, and your doctors should address them thoroughly.\n*   **Vaccination Location:** Choose a location that is equipped to handle medical emergencies in the very rare case one arises.\n\n**Key Questions to Ask Your Doctors:**\n\n*   \"Given my history of GBS after a flu shot, what is the estimated risk of GBS recurrence with each of the available COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA vs. J&J)?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific tests or monitoring I should undergo before or after vaccination, given my autoimmune markers and medical history?\"\n*   \"What is the plan for managing potential vaccine side effects, such as fever, and how will we monitor for any signs of neurological complications?\"\n*   \"What are the local COVID-19 transmission rates and severity in my community, and how does that factor into my personal risk assessment?\"\n*   \"Is there a way I can spread out the vaccinations, or take a smaller dose to start, to see if it's possible?\"\n*   \"In the unlikely event of a GBS relapse, what is the plan for accessing IVIg or plasma exchange treatment?\"\n\n**General Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Prioritize the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) if available.**\n*   **Get vaccinated at a location where medical support is readily available.**\n*   **Discuss a plan with your doctors for managing potential side effects.**\n*   **Be vigilant for any new or worsening neurological symptoms after vaccination.**\n\n**Important Considerations Beyond the Vaccine:**\n\nEven if you decide to get vaccinated, continue practicing other preventative measures:\n\n*   **Hand Hygiene:** Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.\n*   **Social Distancing:** Maintain physical distance from others, especially in crowded settings.\n*   **Mask Wearing:** Wear a high-quality mask (N95 or KN95) in public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status.\n*   **Ventilation:** Improve ventilation in indoor spaces by opening windows or using air purifiers.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis is a complex decision that requires careful consideration and a thorough discussion with your healthcare providers.  Your concerns are valid, and it's essential to weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination based on your individual circumstances. Don't hesitate to ask questions and advocate for your health.\n"

    "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

    "answer": "Okay, I understand the situation. You're understandably worried, and your intuition as a research scientist is telling you this is more than just anxiety, which is valid considering the neurological symptoms. Here's my assessment and recommendations, based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Why Your Concern is Justified:**\n\n*   **The Neurological Symptoms are Red Flags:** Loss of balance, slurred speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades, fainting \u2013 these are *not* typical panic attack symptoms. While anxiety can *exacerbate* some of these symptoms, the collection of them, their severity, and their frequency warrant a neurological investigation.\n*   **The Time Scale:** Panic attacks typically last minutes, not hours. 3-6 hour episodes are unusual for typical panic disorder.\n*   **Memory Loss:** The fact that he barely remembers the episodes is particularly concerning. This points away from a purely psychological origin.\n*   **Ineffectiveness of Treatment:** While Lyrica can be helpful for anxiety, it's not a first-line treatment for panic disorder. And a lavender oil extract seems like a ridiculously inadequate response to the severity of his symptoms.\n*   **Previous Trauma:** While his history of childhood abuse and neglect could be contributing to anxiety and depression, it doesn't automatically explain the neurological symptoms. It's important to consider that trauma can sometimes manifest physically in unexpected ways.\n\n**Possible Neurological Conditions to Consider (Disclaimer: I am not a doctor and this is not a diagnosis. This is only for you to discuss with a medical professional):**\n\n*   **Seizure Disorder:** Although the EEG was negative in the ER, EEGs are only snapshots in time. It's possible he's experiencing non-convulsive seizures (absence seizures, complex partial seizures) that are not being captured. The memory loss and confusion fit this.\n*   **Vestibular Disorder:** Issues with the inner ear can cause balance problems, dizziness, and even nausea.\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Some migraine types can cause neurological symptoms that resemble stroke or seizure.\n*   **Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder):** This is a condition where psychological stress manifests as neurological symptoms. It *is* possible, but it should be diagnosed *after* ruling out other organic causes.\n*   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** This is a rarer possibility, but it involves inflammation in the brain and can cause a variety of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.\n*   **Vitamin Deficiency/Metabolic Issue:** Deficiencies in certain vitamins (B12, D) can cause neurological problems.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** Lyrica *can* cause dizziness, drowsiness, and confusion, but it's less likely to cause all of these symptoms combined, especially not after being on it for several months.\n\n**What You Need to Do (Given the Challenges of the Quebec Healthcare System):**\n\n1.  **Document EVERYTHING:** Keep a detailed log of his symptoms, including the date, time, duration, specific symptoms, what he was doing before, any potential triggers, and what, if anything, helped. This will be invaluable when you finally get in front of a neurologist.\n2.  **Advocate, Advocate, Advocate:** You are his advocate. You need to be firm and persistent. Here's how:\n    *   **Go back to the ER (again):** If he has another episode with severe neurological symptoms (fainting, prolonged slurred speech, confusion), take him back to the ER. Emphasize the neurological symptoms to the triage nurse and the doctor. Demand a neurological consult. Make sure they understand the *duration* of the symptoms. Do not mention panic attacks if possible, and make sure they know you are concerned with his slurred speech, loss of balance, and fainting.\n    *   **Try to find a family doctor:** It sounds like you already tried, but keep trying. Call clinics regularly to check for availability. Having a family doctor is the easiest route to getting a referral.\n    *   **Patient Ombudsman/Complaints Department:** Contact the patient ombudsman or complaints department for the hospital and/or the health authority in your region. Explain the situation and the lack of appropriate care.\n    *   **Ask His Psychiatrist Directly for a Referral Again:** Explain calmly and clearly that you are concerned about neurological symptoms and that you need a neurologist to rule out organic causes. State that you are not asking for it to confirm your suspicions, but simply to rule out any potential neurological causes. He may be more willing to refer if you are firm but kind. If he refuses, ask him to document in the chart that he refused your request for a neurological referral, and the reason for the refusal.\n    *   **Second Opinion:** In Quebec, you can often get a second opinion, even without a referral. Contact another psychiatrist and explain the situation. They might be more willing to order a neurological consult.\n3.  **Safety Plan:** Given his suicidal thoughts, you need a safety plan.\n    *   **Crisis Line:** Know the local crisis line number (suicide prevention). Have it readily available.\n    *   **Remove potential hazards:** Secure any medications, sharp objects, or other items he could use to harm himself.\n    *   **Involve Support:** Reach out to trusted friends or family members for support.\n    *   **Limit Alcohol and Nicotine:** While it will be difficult, encourage him to reduce or eliminate alcohol and nicotine. Both can worsen anxiety and potentially interact with his medications.\n4.  **Focus on Basic Health:**\n    *   **Nutrition:** Ensure he's eating regular, nutritious meals, even if he has to eat small amounts frequently.\n    *   **Sleep:** Encourage a regular sleep schedule.\n    *   **Hydration:** Make sure he's drinking enough water.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Lyrica (Pregabalin):**\n\n*   **Withdrawal:** Abruptly stopping Lyrica can cause withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. This is why his psychiatrist may be slowly lowering his dose (although lavender oil is an unacceptable alternative in this situation).\n*   **Side Effects:** As mentioned, Lyrica *can* cause neurological side effects, but it's less likely after being on it for a while.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYou are right to be concerned. His symptoms are not typical of panic attacks and warrant a thorough neurological evaluation. You need to be a persistent advocate for your boyfriend, documenting everything, contacting the right people, and demanding appropriate care.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're questioning the connection between your son's Chiari malformation and his epilepsy, even though doctors are saying they're not related. It's natural to look for answers and connections when your child is diagnosed with two seemingly unusual conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the doctors might say they're unrelated, why you might still suspect a connection, and what questions you can ask to get more clarity:\n\n**Why Doctors Might Say They're Unrelated**\n\n*   **Different Mechanisms:** Epilepsy is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Chiari malformations are structural abnormalities where brain tissue (usually the cerebellar tonsils) extends into the spinal canal. While both affect the brain and nervous system, the direct *mechanisms* of cause and effect are generally considered separate.\n*   **Prevalence:** Both Chiari malformations and epilepsy are relatively common conditions. Finding them together in one individual *could* be coincidental. Just because two things occur together doesn't mean one caused the other.\n*   **Typical Chiari Symptoms:** Classic symptoms of Chiari malformations often involve headaches (especially with coughing or straining), neck pain, balance problems, muscle weakness, numbness, and other neurological issues. Epilepsy isn't typically listed as a direct symptom.\n*   **Lack of Clear Causal Pathway:** There isn't a well-established, widely accepted medical understanding of how a Chiari malformation *directly* causes generalized epilepsy. Doctors rely on evidence-based medicine, and if that evidence isn't there, they are less likely to attribute the conditions to each other.\n\n**Why You Might Still Suspect a Connection**\n\n*   **Proximity:** The cerebellum, which is affected by the Chiari malformation, plays a role in motor control and coordination. While not directly involved in seizure generation in most epilepsy types, some research explores cerebellar involvement in certain seizure types.\n*   **Altered CSF Flow:** Chiari malformations can disrupt the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF bathes and protects the brain and spinal cord. Altered CSF dynamics *could* potentially affect the brain's electrical environment in subtle ways, though this is more theoretical and less directly linked to generalized epilepsy.\n*   **The \"Gut Feeling\":** As a parent, you know your child best. It's natural to trust your instincts and wonder if there's a link that doctors might be overlooking.\n*   **It is an atypical presentation:** His tonsillar ectopia is significantly below normal.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctors**\n\nTo get a better understanding of your son's situation and ease your concerns, consider asking your doctors these questions:\n\n*   \"Can you explain in more detail why you believe the Chiari malformation and epilepsy are not related in my son's case, considering the severity of his Chiari?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific areas of his MRI that you looked at to assess potential connections between the Chiari and his brain's electrical activity?\"\n*   \"Are there any known rare or unusual cases where Chiari malformations have been linked to seizure disorders, even if it's not a common association?\"\n*   \"What are the potential long-term implications of his Chiari malformation, and what monitoring or management is recommended?\"\n*   \"Could the Chiari malformation be contributing to any of his symptoms, even if it's not directly causing the seizures?\" (Focus on specific behaviors or issues you've noticed).\n*   \"Are there any other tests or evaluations you would recommend to further investigate the cause of his epilepsy, given the presence of the Chiari?\"\n*   \"Is it possible that the Chiari malformation could *indirectly* influence seizure threshold or medication effectiveness?\"\n*   \"Who would you recommend that I get a second opinion from to help understand if the epilepsy and Chiari malformation are related?\n\n**Next Steps and Considerations**\n\n*   **Second Opinion:** Consider seeking a second opinion from a pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy *and* a neurosurgeon specializing in Chiari malformations, ideally at a center with expertise in both conditions. This can provide a more comprehensive perspective.\n*   **Detailed Seizure Diary:** Keep a very detailed seizure diary, noting anything that seems to precede, trigger, or follow a seizure. Share this information with your doctors.\n*   **Research:** While it's important to rely on your doctors' expertise, do your own research using reputable medical sources (e.g., the Epilepsy Foundation, the Chiari & Syringomyelia Foundation, academic journals).\n*   **Support Groups:** Connect with other parents of children with epilepsy, Chiari malformations, or both. Sharing experiences and insights can be invaluable.\n*   **Trust Your Instincts, But Be Open to Information:** Continue to trust your instincts as a parent, but also be open to the information and expertise that your doctors provide.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Do not stop or change your son's Keppra dosage without consulting his doctor.** Epilepsy medication requires careful management.\n*   **This information is for general knowledge and discussion only, and does not constitute medical advice.** Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your son's care.\n\nIt's a complex situation, and it's important to advocate for your son and seek the best possible understanding of his conditions. By asking the right questions, seeking expert opinions, and staying informed, you can work with his medical team to develop the most appropriate care plan for him.\n"

    "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation and I understand your frustration after five years of investigation without a solid diagnosis. It's good that you've diligently documented your symptoms and ruled out many possibilities. Let's break down what might be going on and potential next steps.\n\n**Key Symptoms and Findings:**\n\n*   **Episodic Double Vision:** Sudden onset, ~40 minutes duration, relatively infrequent (up to 10 times a year).\n*   **Associated Disorientation/Dizziness:** Present before and during episodes. Dizziness exacerbated by movement during double vision.\n*   **Temporal Pattern:** Episodes cluster within certain periods (September-April).\n*   **Possible Triggers Ruled Out:** You've ruled out a wide range of common triggers.\n*   **Neurological Evaluation:** Brain masses, scar tissue, epilepsy, and migraines have been ruled out.\n*   **Systemic Issues Ruled Out:** Blood sugar, blood pressure, dehydration, and medication levels have been ruled out.\n*   **Vitamin D Deficiency & Peripheral Neuropathy:** History of vitamin D deficiency leading to peripheral neuropathy, which resolved with treatment. However, the neuropathy has returned despite normal Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels.\n*   **Concussion History:** You've had multiple concussions as a child.\n*   **Benzodiazepine Overdose:** One overdose prior to the onset of episodes.\n\n**Possible Explanations & Directions for Further Investigation:**\n\nGiven the information you've provided, here are a few possibilities to consider, along with potential next steps you could discuss with your doctor:\n\n1.  **Intermittent Oculomotor Nerve Palsy:**\n    *   **Explanation:** This is a disruption in the function of one or more of the nerves that control eye movement. Since it's episodic, it could be a temporary disruption of the nerve function rather than a complete and persistent palsy. While you saw multiple doctors, you didn't specify if this was specifically tested or looked for.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** Explains the double vision.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   Detailed neurological exam *during an episode* if possible.  This is difficult to time, but if you can get to an urgent care or emergency room during an episode, that would allow for real-time assessment.\n        *   Specifically request testing to evaluate the function of each of the cranial nerves involved in eye movement (III, IV, and VI).\n\n2.  **Convergence Insufficiency (CI):**\n    *   **Explanation:** Difficulty coordinating both eyes to focus on a near target. While you ruled out eye fatigue, CI can be intermittent and may not be apparent on a standard eye exam.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** Can cause double vision, eye strain, and difficulty concentrating.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   Consult with an optometrist specializing in vision therapy.  They have specific tests to evaluate convergence and other binocular vision problems.\n\n3.  **Central Nervous System Issue (Despite Initial Negative Findings):**\n    *   **Explanation:** Even with normal initial imaging, there's a small possibility of a subtle CNS issue that is not easily detectable on standard scans. The combination of double vision, disorientation, and previous concussions warrants careful consideration.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** Could explain both the double vision and the disorientation.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   **Repeat MRI of the brain with contrast:** Ask the neurologist if there are any specific imaging protocols that could better evaluate cranial nerve function or subtle brainstem abnormalities.\n        *   **Consider neuro-ophthalmology consultation:** A neuro-ophthalmologist specializes in visual problems related to the nervous system. They are best equipped to evaluate complex cases like yours.\n\n4.  **Post-Concussive Syndrome (PCS):**\n    *   **Explanation:** Symptoms persisting after a concussion.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** History of concussions. While symptoms can start soon after the concussion, they can also appear after a delay. The double vision could be related to disruption of the pathways that control eye movement.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   Neuropsychological testing: Can evaluate cognitive function and identify any deficits related to the concussions.\n        *   Discuss with your doctor about a trial of medication for Post-Concussive Syndrome.\n\n5.  **Vestibular Migraine:**\n    *   **Explanation:** Migraines that present with vestibular symptoms (dizziness, imbalance) more prominently than headache.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** It's possible that the \"disorientation\" you're experiencing is actually a form of migraine-related dizziness.  Although you ruled out \"migraines\" in the past, this is a specific subtype.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   Careful history focusing on any migraine-like symptoms (even subtle ones) during or around the episodes.\n        *   Trial of migraine-preventative medications, even if you don't have headaches.\n\n6.  **Decompensation of a Pre-Existing Condition:**\n    *   **Explanation:** Sometimes, a minor, previously unnoticed weakness or imbalance in the eye muscles can become symptomatic later in life, especially under stress or with age.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** Explains the double vision, and could develop as you get older.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   A very detailed ophthalmological exam, paying close attention to subtle eye muscle imbalances.\n\n7.  **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**\n    *   **Explanation:** A condition where there are neurological symptoms, but no identifiable structural or organic cause. Symptoms are real and can be disabling, but they arise from a problem with how the brain functions, rather than damage to the brain itself.\n    *   **Why it Fits:** This is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other possible causes have been ruled out. The lack of a clear organic cause despite thorough investigation raises this possibility.\n    *   **Further Investigation:**\n        *   Consultation with a neurologist specializing in FND.\n        *   Psychological evaluation: To assess for any underlying psychological factors that may be contributing to the symptoms.\n        *   This diagnosis should only be considered after all other organic causes have been thoroughly investigated.\n\n**General Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Continue to meticulously record your symptoms, including timing, duration, specific characteristics of the double vision, and any associated symptoms.\n*   **Video Recording:** If possible, try to record yourself during an episode. This can be helpful for doctors to observe your symptoms firsthand.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** You've been persistent in seeking answers, and it's important to continue advocating for yourself and working with your medical team to explore all possible explanations.\n*   **Second Opinions:** Don't hesitate to seek second opinions from specialists in neurology and ophthalmology.\n*   **Be Patient:** Diagnosing unusual and intermittent symptoms can be challenging and time-consuming.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Peripheral Neuropathy Recurrence:** The recurrence of your peripheral neuropathy despite normal vitamin D levels is concerning. It is important to investigate this further to identify its underlying cause. Your doctor is correct to consider repeat neurological assessment due to the combination of the episodic double vision and the peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Concussion History:** The timing of your double vision appearing years after your concussions may mean they are not related. But it is important to consider it still as post concussive syndrome can be difficult to diagnose.\n*   **Benzo Overdose:** The Benzo overdose is unlikely to be related, but it should be mentioned to any specialist you see.\n\nI hope this comprehensive overview is helpful. Remember to discuss these possibilities and suggested investigations with your doctor to develop a personalized diagnostic and management plan.  Good luck!\n"

    "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're looking for a device to help your brother walk safely, especially given his weight and frequent falls. While I can't definitively recommend a specific product without a proper medical evaluation, I can offer some information and suggest types of devices you could research and discuss with his doctor and physical therapist.\n\n**It's crucial to emphasize that you should consult with your brother's doctor and a physical therapist or occupational therapist before trying any new mobility device. They can properly assess his needs, diagnose the cause of his falls, and recommend the most appropriate and safe solutions.**\n\n**Why a Custom Solution Might Be Necessary:**\n\nThe combination of your brother's weight, the potential force of a sudden fall, and the need for a harness system makes finding an \"off-the-shelf\" product that perfectly fits his needs challenging. Standard walkers and rollators are typically designed for a certain weight limit, and a harness system capable of safely arresting a 250 lb fall requires robust engineering.\n\n**Potential Device Concepts to Explore and Discuss with Professionals:**\n\n1.  **Heavy-Duty Gait Trainer with Fall Arrest System:**\n\n    *   **Gait Trainers:** These are mobility devices designed to help individuals with gait and balance difficulties. Look for bariatric (heavy-duty) models with a high weight capacity.\n    *   **Custom Harness System:** A harness system specifically designed for fall arrest would need to be integrated. This would likely involve:\n        *   A properly fitted full-body harness for your brother.\n        *   Strong, adjustable straps connecting the harness to the gait trainer.\n        *   **Shock Absorption:** This is critical! A bungee cord or energy-absorbing lanyard system similar to those used in industrial fall protection could potentially be adapted to cushion the impact of a fall. The challenge is calculating the correct resistance and travel distance of the shock absorber to safely decelerate your brother's weight without causing injury.\n        *   **Emergency Release:** A quick-release mechanism on the harness is essential in case of an emergency.\n    *   **Customization is Key:** The harness attachment points on the gait trainer might need to be reinforced or modified to handle the stress of a fall.\n\n2.  **Custom-Built \"Cage Walker\":**\n\n    *   A custom-built frame, possibly made of steel, could provide a more enclosed and stable environment. Think of a large, sturdy walker that surrounds your brother.\n    *   The harness system and shock absorption elements described above would still be necessary.\n    *   This would likely require the expertise of a skilled engineer or fabricator who specializes in mobility aids.\n\n3.  **Modified Bariatric Rollator with Attendant Control and Fall Detection:**\n\n    *   A heavy-duty rollator (walker with wheels and brakes) with a high weight capacity could be modified.\n    *   **Attendant Control:**  A caregiver would need to be present to steer and control the rollator.\n    *   **Fall Detection System:**  Integrate a fall detection system with immediate braking.  There are devices (like smartwatches or pendants) that can detect a sudden fall and trigger an alarm or braking mechanism.\n    *   **Harness Integration:**  A lighter-duty harness might be used primarily for stability and to prevent complete collapse, rather than a full fall arrest.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Weight Distribution and Stability:** The device must be extremely stable to prevent it from tipping over when your brother leans or falls.\n*   **Maneuverability:** The device must be relatively easy to maneuver, especially on uneven surfaces.\n*   **Comfort:**  Ensure the harness and support systems are comfortable to wear for extended periods.\n*   **Training:** Both your brother and any caregivers need thorough training on how to use the device safely.\n*   **Liability:**  Consult with a legal professional about liability issues, especially if you are considering a custom-built device.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1.  **Consult with Medical Professionals:** Schedule appointments with your brother's doctor, a neurologist (to investigate the fainting spells), and a physical therapist or occupational therapist specializing in mobility devices.\n2.  **Obtain a Proper Diagnosis:**  Determine the underlying cause of the fainting spells/seizures to guide treatment and fall prevention strategies.\n3.  **Assess Needs and Goals:** Work with the therapists to identify specific goals for mobility and fall prevention.\n4.  **Research Mobility Devices:**  Explore the types of devices mentioned above, paying close attention to weight capacities and potential for customization.\n5.  **Contact Manufacturers and Assistive Technology Specialists:**  Reach out to manufacturers of bariatric mobility devices and assistive technology specialists to discuss your brother's specific needs and explore custom solutions.\n6.  **Consider a Custom Fabrication:** If no existing device meets your requirements, explore the possibility of having a custom device built by a qualified engineer or fabricator.\n7.  **Prioritize Safety:**  Safety should be the paramount concern. Thoroughly test any device before using it regularly.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical or engineering advice.

    "answer": "Okay, let's break down what the MRI findings mean in the context of your medical history, and what the next steps might be. It's important to remember I'm an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes and discussion, and you *absolutely must* discuss these results with your doctor for proper interpretation and management.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n*   **Multiple Arterially Enhancing Lesions:** This means the lesions are \"lighting up\" with contrast during the arterial phase (when blood is flowing into the liver). This is a key piece of information that helps narrow down the possibilities.\n*   **Hyperintense on T2:** This refers to how the lesions appear on a specific type of MRI sequence (T2-weighted). Hyperintense usually means they appear brighter than the surrounding liver tissue.\n*   **Without Internal Fat:** This helps rule out certain types of lesions that often contain fat.\n*   **Dominant Lesion: 1.8 cm in Segment 6:**  This indicates the location and size of the largest lesion. Segment 6 is a specific region of the right lobe of the liver.\n*   **Other Prominent Lesions:** Smaller lesions were found in segments 6, 5, and 2.\n*   **No Definite Washout, but Less Enhancement Than Vessels on Delayed Phases:** Washout refers to the contrast \"washing out\" of the lesion in the delayed phase (later images). The absence of definite washout is significant. The subtle detail of the lesions enhancing less than the vessels makes hemangioma less likely.\n*   **Impression: Adenoma with Differential Including Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):** The radiologist is suggesting that the most likely diagnosis is a liver adenoma, but also considering focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) as a possibility.\n\n**Understanding the Possible Diagnoses:**\n\n*   **Liver Adenoma:** These are benign (non-cancerous) tumors of the liver. They are more common in women, and their growth is often linked to estrogen exposure (such as from birth control pills like Yaz). *Importantly, liver adenomas have a small risk of bleeding or, very rarely, transforming into liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).*\n*   **Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):** This is another type of benign liver lesion. FNH is generally considered to have no malignant potential and rarely causes symptoms.\n\n**Why are these findings concerning, and why are they being followed up?**\n\nThe findings are concerning because your medications and your history of chronic pancreatitis status post TP/AIT have to be considered.\n\n**Key Considerations Based on Your Medical History:**\n\n*   **Medications (Yaz, Trokendi, Abilify, Pristiq, Cymbalta):**\n    *   *Yaz (birth control):* As mentioned, estrogen-containing birth control pills are strongly associated with the development and growth of liver adenomas. *This is a very important factor to discuss with your doctor.*\n    *   *Other medications:* While less directly linked to liver adenomas, some medications can potentially affect liver function and should be considered in the context of these findings.\n*   **Epilepsy:** The relationship between epilepsy and liver lesions is not direct, but some anti-epileptic drugs can impact liver function.\n*   **Migraines:**  No direct link to liver lesions.\n*   **Chronic Pancreatitis Status Post TP/AIT:**  This indicates a history of significant pancreatic issues and surgery. While the pancreas and liver are separate organs, they are closely related in terms of digestion and blood supply. The history of pancreatitis could potentially influence liver health.\n*   **Current Symptoms (Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Vomiting):** While the liver lesions might be incidental findings, it's important to determine if they could be contributing to your current symptoms, even if indirectly.\n*   **B12 injections** - could be a reason for adenoma growth.\n\n**What Your Doctor Will Likely Do Next:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Discussion:** Your doctor will discuss the MRI findings, your medical history, and your medications in detail.\n2.  **Further Imaging:**\n    *   *Repeat MRI/CT:** A follow-up MRI or CT scan (usually in 3-6 months) is very likely to assess for any growth or changes in the lesions.\n    *   *Consider Liver Biopsy:** If the diagnosis is unclear after imaging, or if there's concern about the possibility of malignancy, a liver biopsy may be recommended. This involves taking a small sample of liver tissue for examination under a microscope.\n3.  **Management Plan:**\n    *   *Discontinuation/Change of Birth Control:* If the lesions are confirmed to be adenomas, and especially if they are growing, your doctor will *very likely* recommend stopping Yaz (or any other estrogen-containing birth control).  Switching to a non-hormonal method of contraception will be crucial.\n    *   *Monitoring:** If the lesions are small and stable, and the diagnosis is likely FNH, your doctor may recommend regular monitoring with imaging.\n    *   *Surgical Resection:** In rare cases, if an adenoma is large, causing symptoms, or has a high risk of complications, surgical removal may be considered.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"What is the most likely diagnosis, and why?\"\n*   \"What are the risks associated with these lesions, given my medical history and medications?\"\n*   \"What is the plan for follow-up imaging and/or biopsy?\"\n*   \"Do you recommend that I stop taking Yaz, and what are my other contraception options?\"\n*   \"Could these lesions be contributing to my abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting?\"\n*   \"Are there any other tests or evaluations that you recommend?\"\n\n**In summary, the MRI findings suggest the possibility of liver adenomas, which require careful evaluation and management due to the potential link with your birth control pills and the small risk of complications. It's essential to discuss these results with your doctor to determine the best course of action.**\n"

    "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",

    "answer": "I understand your immense worry and fear for your wife's health, especially after such a traumatic experience. It's completely natural to be on high alert and analyze every little change. However, I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.\n\nGiven the complexity of her situation, including the seizures, postpartum state, medication changes, and new symptoms, it is imperative to communicate to your doctor.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why and what you should discuss with the doctor, emphasizing the points you've raised:\n\n*   **Risk of Seizures:** The most important thing you can do is to ask if she is at risk of getting seizures again? What are the chances?\n\n*   **Phenytoin Side Effects:** Many of the symptoms you describe *could* be related to Phenytoin. The blurry vision, deep sleepiness, and even the itching are listed as potential side effects. Even though the dosage was lowered, it could still be a contributing factor.\n\n*   **The Itching:** The itching is a significant concern, especially given the timing of its onset. While itching *can* be a side effect of some medications, it can also be a sign of other underlying issues. **Do not assume it's MS.** MS is a complex diagnosis and requires extensive testing. Presenting your concerns and observations to the doctor is the most important step you can take.\n\n*   **Body Vibrations/Shaking:** The reports of her feeling vibrations or shaking in her limbs are concerning and need to be reported immediately to the doctor.\n\n*   **Postpartum Factors:** Pregnancy and the postpartum period can significantly impact a woman's health. Hormonal changes and physiological stress can contribute to various symptoms, including neurological ones.\n\n**Things you should discuss with the doctor:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Symptom Log:** Keep a detailed log of all her symptoms:\n    *   When they started\n    *   How long they last\n    *   What seems to trigger them\n    *   What makes them better or worse\n\n2.  **Questions about Phenytoin:** Ask the doctor specifically about the side effects of Phenytoin and if they could be causing the symptoms she's experiencing.\n\n3.  **Alternative Diagnoses:** Ask the doctor what other possible explanations there could be for her symptoms, including the seizures themselves.\n\n4.  **Further Testing:** Based on your wife's symptoms, ask if further testing is warranted to rule out other potential causes.\n\n5.  **Emergency Plan:** Confirm with the doctor what you should do if she experiences another seizure. Have a clear plan in place.\n\n**In the meantime:**\n\n*   **Reduce Stress:** Stress can be a trigger for seizures. Help your wife manage stress through relaxation techniques, gentle exercise, or spending time in nature.\n\n*   **Prioritize Sleep:** Adequate sleep is crucial. Aim for a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n*   **Healthy Diet:** Maintain a healthy diet and stay hydrated.\n\nRemember, you are your wife's advocate. Don't hesitate to ask questions and seek clarification from her doctors. Promptly report new or worsening symptoms.\n"

    "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, what you're describing is definitely something you should discuss with a doctor. Neurological sensations, especially those with accompanying emotional and perceptual changes, warrant investigation. Since these symptoms involve a combination of physical sensations (tingling, shivers, dizziness, headache) and subjective experiences (emotional shift, altered perception of reality), it's difficult to pinpoint the cause without a thorough evaluation. Here's a breakdown of possible considerations and why a doctor's visit is crucial:\n\n**Possible Considerations (Keep in mind I am NOT a doctor, and this is not a diagnosis):**\n\n*   **Migraine Variant:** While you state it's different from your migraine auras, some migraine presentations can be atypical. Migraines can sometimes manifest with unusual sensory or emotional symptoms, even without a prominent headache in some cases (or the headache might come later). Atypical auras can cause a wide range of experiences.\n*   **Focal Seizure:** A focal (partial) seizure originates in one area of the brain. It can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the location of the seizure activity. These can include sensory changes (tingling, shivers), emotional changes (fear, deja vu), altered perception, and sometimes dizziness. Often, there is no convulsion or loss of consciousness.\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Disorder with Somatic Symptoms:** Anxiety can sometimes manifest with physical symptoms that feel neurological. Derealization (feeling that your surroundings are unreal) and depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself) are common in anxiety disorders. However, the specific tingling/shivering sensation should still be investigated.\n*   **Vestibular Issues:** Problems with the inner ear (vestibular system) can cause dizziness, imbalance, and sometimes sensory distortions. While less likely to explain the emotional and perceptual components, it could contribute to the dizziness.\n*   **Disautonomia/POTS:** Though more rare, disautonomia can produce odd sensations and dizziness\n\n**Why You Need to See a Doctor:**\n\n1.  **Rule Out Serious Causes:** It's essential to rule out any potentially serious neurological conditions like seizures, TIA (transient ischemic attack), or other brain abnormalities.\n2.  **Accurate Diagnosis:** A doctor can take a detailed history, perform a physical and neurological exam, and order appropriate tests (if necessary) to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n3.  **Appropriate Management:** Once a diagnosis is made, your doctor can recommend appropriate treatment options, which might include medication, lifestyle changes, or therapy.\n4.  **Peace of Mind:** Understanding what's causing these sensations can alleviate anxiety and improve your quality of life.\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Detailed Description of Symptoms:** Describe the tingling/shivering, emotional changes (dread, deja vu), altered perception, dizziness, and headache as precisely as possible.\n*   **Frequency and Duration:** How often do these episodes occur? How long do they last?\n*   **Triggers:** Are there any specific triggers you've identified (stress, sleep deprivation, certain foods, etc.)?\n*   **Associated Symptoms:** Are there any other symptoms you experience before, during, or after the episodes (e.g., vision changes, weakness, speech difficulties, memory problems)?\n*   **Medical History:** Mention your occasional migraines with visual aura and any other relevant medical history.\n*   **Family History:** Is there a family history of seizures, migraines, neurological disorders, or psychiatric conditions?\n*   **Impact on Daily Life:** How do these episodes affect your ability to work, socialize, or perform daily tasks?\n\n**What to Expect at the Doctor's Office:**\n\n*   **Medical History and Physical Exam:** The doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history, and family history. They will also perform a physical exam, including a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, sensation, and mental status.\n*   **Possible Tests:** Depending on your symptoms and the doctor's findings, they may order tests such as:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To measure brain activity and look for seizure activity.\n    *   **MRI or CT Scan of the Brain:** To visualize the brain and look for structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To rule out other medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.\n    *   **Vestibular Testing:** If dizziness is a prominent symptom.\n\n**In summary, please make an appointment to see a doctor (ideally a neurologist) as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms.** The more information you can provide, the better equipped they will be to help you.\n\n"

    "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents.

    "answer": "Okay, I understand. It sounds like you've had a frustrating and confusing experience with your epilepsy management. Let's break down what you've described and try to address your question of why things seem to have gone downhill.\n\n**Key Issues & Possible Explanations**\n\n1.  **Misunderstanding/Dismissal of Myoclonic Seizures:** This is a significant problem. Myoclonic seizures *are* seizures, and they indicate that your epilepsy is not fully controlled. The fact that you were told you were seizure-free despite experiencing them is a major issue. These likely explain your confusion, due to medical professional dismissal.\n\n2.  **Stopping Medication Too Soon:** Even if the EEG was normal, the presence of myoclonic seizures while on medication should have been a red flag. Stopping medication after only 3 years (of *full* seizure freedom, not just absence of tonic-clonic seizures) is often considered premature.\n\n3.  **Poor Medication Management & Switch:** This is another critical point. A *significant* mistake has been made. Here's why:\n\n    *   **Inadequate Lamotrigine Dose:** 25mg of Lamotrigine is a starting dose. It's nowhere near a therapeutic level for most adults, especially those who were previously controlled on Keppra. Lamotrigine needs to be slowly titrated upwards to avoid side effects.\n    *   **Abrupt Medication Switch:** You can't abruptly switch from Keppra to Lamotrigine without proper overlap and titration. Keppra needs to be tapered down *while* Lamotrigine is gradually increased. Suddenly stopping Keppra and starting a tiny dose of Lamotrigine is a recipe for breakthrough seizures.\n    *   **Pharmacist Concerns:** The fact that pharmacists were concerned about the prescription speaks volumes.\n    * This led to breakthrough seizures - which are a major problem and can cause other health concerns, such as increased anxiety or stress.\n\n4.  **The Kindling Effect:** When seizures recur after a period of control, the brain may become more susceptible to having more seizures in the future. This is sometimes referred to as the \"kindling effect.\" Each seizure can lower the threshold for future seizures. This might be contributing to your current situation.\n\n5.  **Sleep Deprivation:** This is a major trigger for seizures in many people with epilepsy. Your experience in September highlights this.\n\n6.  **Mental Health:** While a formal diagnosis is lacking, your self-described history of depression, anxiety, and possible other mental health concerns can significantly impact seizure control. Stress, anxiety, and sleep problems related to mental health can lower the seizure threshold.\n\n7.  **EEG Results:**\n\n    *   **April 2021 EEG:**\n        *   \"Foyer de ralentissement localis\u00e9 fronto-temporal bilat\u00e9ral intermittent. Absence d'anomalies \u00e9pileptiformes franches.\"\n        *   Translation: \"A focus of localized intermittent slowing in the bilateral fronto-temporal region. Absence of clear epileptiform abnormalities.\"\n        *   **Interpretation:** This is *not* a completely normal EEG. \"Foyer de ralentissement\" (focus of slowing) indicates some abnormality in brain activity. While it doesn't show definite epileptiform spikes (the classic EEG signature of epilepsy), it suggests a potential area of instability. The fact that it is intermittent and in the fronto-temporal regions (which are often associated with epilepsy) is concerning.\n    *   **April 2022 EEG:** \"Normal exam\" \u2013 This is reassuring, but it's important to remember that a single normal EEG doesn't rule out epilepsy, especially when you have a history of seizures. EEGs are snapshots in time and can miss abnormalities.\n\n**Why Things Went Downhill (Summary):**\n\nThe primary reason for the decline is almost certainly the **inappropriate medication management.** You were effectively taken off a working medication (Keppra) and put on a sub-therapeutic dose of a new medication (Lamotrigine) without a proper transition. This triggered breakthrough seizures, which may have made your epilepsy harder to control in the long run. Sleep deprivation and potentially underlying mental health issues likely exacerbated the situation.\n\n**Recommendations & Actions to Take:**\n\n1.  **Find a New Neurologist (Epilepsy Specialist):** This is crucial. You need a neurologist with expertise in epilepsy who understands myoclonic seizures, proper medication management, and the impact of mental health on seizure control. Look for an epileptologist if possible.\n2.  **Medication Review:** The current medication regimen needs to be re-evaluated.\n    *   **Lamotrigine Titration:** The Lamotrigine dose likely needs to be increased significantly. Your neurologist should slowly titrate it upwards while monitoring for side effects.\n    *   **Keppra Dose:** It's possible the Keppra dose is adequate, but it needs to be assessed in combination with the Lamotrigine.\n    *   **Consider a Different Medication:** If the combination of Keppra and Lamotrigine isn't working, your neurologist might consider other anti-seizure medications.\n    *   **Clobazam Use:** Discuss the frequency and appropriateness of Clobazam use with your neurologist. It can be helpful for breakthrough seizures, but it also has potential for tolerance and dependence with frequent use.\n3.  **Detailed Seizure Diary:** Keep a meticulous record of all seizures, including myoclonic seizures. Note the time of day, duration, potential triggers (sleep deprivation, stress, missed medications), and any other relevant factors.\n4.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize sleep. Aim for a consistent sleep schedule, a dark and quiet bedroom, and avoid caffeine or alcohol before bed. Talk to your doctor about strategies to improve sleep if you have insomnia.\n5.  **Mental Health Evaluation:** Seek a formal mental health evaluation from a psychiatrist or psychologist. Addressing underlying depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions can significantly improve seizure control and overall quality of life. Therapy (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) can be very helpful.\n6.  **Repeat EEG:** Discuss with your new neurologist whether a repeat EEG (potentially including sleep deprivation) is warranted.\n7.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Be assertive with your healthcare providers. Don't be afraid to question their recommendations and seek second opinions if you're not comfortable with the treatment plan. Educate yourself about epilepsy and your medications.\n8.  **Consider Referral to an Epilepsy Center:** Epilepsy centers have specialized expertise in diagnosing and managing complex epilepsy cases.

    "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",

    "answer": "This is a complex and concerning situation, and it's good you're seeking information. The symptoms you describe \u2013 unilateral numbness, speech difficulties, headache, and vision loss \u2013 strongly suggest a neurological issue that needs thorough investigation. Given your history of a normal MRI (assuming it was a brain MRI), it could still be a number of possibilities, and further testing is likely warranted.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of potential causes and what you should do next:**\n\n**Potential Causes:**\n\n*   **Hemiplegic Migraine:** This is a type of migraine that involves weakness or paralysis (hemiplegia) on one side of the body. Other symptoms can include sensory changes (numbness, tingling), speech difficulties, and visual disturbances. It can be sporadic or familial.\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** Although less common in someone your age, a TIA is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. It causes stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. While you had a normal MRI in the past, TIAs may not always show up on imaging, especially if they are recent.\n\n*   **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS):** This is a chronic pain condition that can develop after an injury or trauma. While pain is a hallmark, it can also cause changes in sensation, including numbness, and can spread to involve a limb or part of the body. While less likely, it may explain the progression, but is less likely to explain visual loss.\n\n*   **Focal Seizures:** Sometimes seizures don't involve convulsions but can manifest as sensory changes, altered awareness, or speech difficulties.\n\n*   **Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder):** This is a condition where psychological stress manifests as neurological symptoms. The symptoms are real, but their cause is not related to a physical disease. While this is a possibility, it's crucial to rule out all other organic causes first.\n\n*   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** While less likely given your age and the episodic nature, MS can present with various neurological symptoms, including numbness, vision problems, and speech difficulties. Symptoms can come and go in relapses.\n\n*   **Mitochondrial Disorders:** These genetic disorders affect energy production in cells and can manifest with a variety of neurological symptoms.\n\n*   **Rare Genetic Conditions:** There are some rare genetic disorders that can cause episodic neurological symptoms.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Previous Normal MRI:** While reassuring, a single normal MRI doesn't rule everything out. The timing of the MRI relative to your symptoms is important. Also, specific MRI sequences might be needed to look for certain conditions.\n\n*   **Your Mental Health Conditions:** While your ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD are important to consider, it's crucial to rule out a neurological cause for your symptoms before attributing them to psychological factors.\n\n**Next Steps - What You *MUST* Do:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Neurologist IMMEDIATELY:** This is the most important step. You need to see a neurologist as soon as possible. Tell them about your complete medical history, including your psychiatric diagnoses, but emphasize the neurological symptoms and their pattern. Do not downplay anything.\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:** For each episode, record:\n\n    *   **Date and Time:** When did it start? When did it end?\n    *   **Precipitating Factors:** Was there anything that seemed to trigger it (stress, lack of sleep, certain foods, etc.)?\n    *   **Progression of Symptoms:** How did it start? How did it progress?\n    *   **Specific Symptoms:** Numbness (where, how intense), headache (location, intensity, type), speech difficulties (what kind), vision changes (what kind, how long), any other symptoms (weakness, dizziness, etc.)\n    *   **Duration of Each Symptom:** How long did each symptom last?\n    *   **What, if anything, helped:** Did the breathing exercises help, even if temporarily?\n3.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Given your age and psychiatric history, some healthcare providers might be quick to dismiss your symptoms as being psychological. Be persistent. Clearly and calmly explain your symptoms and their impact on your life. Bring your symptom diary. Bring a parent/guardian to help advocate for you.\n4.  **Request Further Testing:** Be prepared to discuss what tests you've already had. You may need:\n\n    *   **Repeat MRI:** If the initial MRI was years ago, a repeat MRI is warranted. Make sure the neurologist orders the correct sequences to look for specific conditions.\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** To rule out seizures.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for autoimmune disorders, inflammatory markers, vitamin deficiencies, and other potential causes.\n    *   **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** In some cases, this may be necessary to rule out certain conditions, such as MS.\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n*   **Don't self-diagnose.** Researching possible causes is helpful, but it's important to get a professional diagnosis.\n*   **Don't give up.** It may take time to find the cause of your symptoms. Be patient and persistent in seeking answers.\n*   **Bring a support person:** Having a trusted adult with you at appointments can be helpful, especially when discussing complex medical issues.\n\n**In summary, your symptoms are concerning and require a thorough neurological evaluation. Advocate for yourself, keep a detailed symptom diary, and work closely with a neurologist to find the cause and get appropriate treatment.**\n"

I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down this situation. It's understandable that you're concerned, especially after googling your medications and seeing the connection between Clonazepam and Myoclonic Epilepsy. Here's a structured way to think about it:\n\n**1. The Doctor's Assessment and Diagnosis:**\n\n*   **Motor Tics:** The neurologist diagnosed motor tics based on your posture, movements, and lack of abnormalities on the EEG. Motor tics are involuntary, repetitive movements.\n*   **AD/HD:** The neurologist also diagnosed AD/HD.\n*   **EEG Was Normal:** This is important. A normal EEG reduces the likelihood of a seizure disorder, though it doesn't completely rule it out. EEGs capture brain activity at a particular point in time and sometimes cannot capture abnormal activity unless it is happening during the test.\n* **Hasn't ruled out Epilepsy:** the doctor likely prescribed Clonazepam due to its effectiveness in treating various movement disorders, including Myoclonic jerks, as well as its anti-anxiety properties. Prescribing it doesn't automatically mean they suspect epilepsy; it might be a precautionary or symptomatic approach.\n\n**2. Medications and Their Possible Uses:**\n\n*   **Tetrabenazine:** This is commonly used to treat hyperkinetic movement disorders like tics, chorea, and dystonia. Its primary action is to deplete dopamine in the brain, which can help reduce involuntary movements.\n*   **Clonidine:** This is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It's used to treat AD/HD, tics, and anxiety. It works by affecting norepinephrine levels in the brain, which can improve focus, reduce impulsivity, and decrease tics. It also lowers Blood Pressure.\n*   **Clonazepam:** This is a benzodiazepine. It works by enhancing the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity. While it's used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy, it's also used for anxiety, panic disorder, and other movement disorders. *The fact that it's prescribed for \"emergency\" situations suggests that the doctor may be using it to manage severe episodes of your jerks, regardless of whether they're epileptic or tic-related.* The anti-anxiety effect of Clonazepam may also help alleviate tic symptoms which are worsened by stress.\n\n**3. Why Clonazepam Might Be Prescribed Even Without a Confirmed Epilepsy Diagnosis:**\n\n*   **Symptomatic Relief:** Clonazepam can be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of various types of jerky movements, whether they're caused by epilepsy, tics, or other neurological conditions.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Sometimes, doctors use medications as part of a \"trial\" to see how a patient responds. If Clonazepam significantly reduces your jerks, it could provide further information to help determine the underlying cause.\n*   **Anxiety and Stress:** Tics can be exacerbated by anxiety and stress. Clonazepam's anti-anxiety effects might indirectly reduce your tics.\n* **Myoclonus is broad:** Myoclonus is a symptom, not necessarily a disease. It can be caused by epilepsy, but also by other neurological conditions, medications, or even sleep deprivation. Clonazepam can treat myoclonus regardless of the cause.\n\n**4. What You Should Do:**\n\n*   **Talk to Your Neurologist:** This is the most important step.  Specifically ask:\n    *   \"Given that the EEG was normal, what is your level of concern about epilepsy? \"\n    *   \"Why are you prescribing Clonazepam, considering my diagnosis of motor tics and AD/HD?\"\n    *   \"Is this a trial to see how I respond, or is it intended for long-term management of my symptoms?\"\n    *   \"What are the potential side effects of all the medication i am taking considering my other underlying conditions.\"\n*   **Be Detailed About Your Symptoms:** Continue to carefully observe and document the frequency, intensity, and triggers of your jerks. This information will be valuable for your neurologist.\n*   **Adhere to the Medication Regimen:** Take your medications as prescribed and monitor their effects closely.\n*   **Don't Panic:** While it's good to be informed and proactive, try not to jump to conclusions. Google can be a valuable resource, but it's not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nIt's not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm that you've been prescribed Clonazepam. It *could* be related to a suspicion of epilepsy, but it's equally likely that it's being used to manage your symptoms of motor tics, anxiety, or a general movement disorder. The key is to have a frank and open conversation with your neurologist to understand their reasoning and treatment plan.\n"

    "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the air hunger, especially as a classical singer! It's smart to be proactive and seek advice. Here's a breakdown of potential causes, strategies to manage the air hunger, and when to seek medical attention:\n\n**Possible Causes of Air Hunger with Vyvanse**\n\n*   **Stimulant Side Effect:** Stimulants like Vyvanse can sometimes cause cardiovascular and respiratory side effects. While direct breathing difficulties aren't the *most* common, they can happen. These effects can stem from increased heart rate, blood pressure, or anxiety, which indirectly affect your breathing.\n*   **Anxiety:** Vyvanse can sometimes exacerbate or trigger anxiety in some individuals. Anxiety can manifest as shortness of breath, chest tightness, or the sensation of not getting enough air, even if your breathing is normal. Given your history, this is a real possibility.\n*   **Dosage Too High/Too Rapid Increase:** Even though your psychiatrist put you on a low dose, some people are more sensitive to the effects of stimulants. Starting too high or increasing the dose too quickly can increase the risk of side effects.\n*   **Interaction with Other Medications:** While Zoloft, Lamictal, and hormonal IUDs don't typically have strong interactions with Vyvanse, individual reactions can vary.\n*   **Underlying Medical Condition:** While less likely, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your air hunger, such as asthma, allergies, or heart problems. (Especially if you were having some air hunger before starting Vyvanse, even if it wasn't as much.)\n\n**Strategies to Manage Air Hunger (While Waiting for Potential Adaptation)**\n\n*   **Contact your prescribing psychiatrist immediately.** This needs to be step one. Side effects, especially involving breathing, should be reported promptly. They may want to adjust your dose, have you stop the medication immediately, or investigate other potential causes. *Do not adjust your medication without talking to your doctor first.*\n*   **Breathing Exercises (Carefully):** Since you're a singer, you already understand breath control. Try gentle diaphragmatic breathing exercises:\n    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Lie on your back with one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Breathe in slowly through your nose, focusing on expanding your abdomen (your lower hand should rise). Breathe out slowly through your mouth.\n    *   **Pursed-Lip Breathing:** Breathe in slowly through your nose. Purse your lips as if you're about to whistle, and breathe out slowly through your mouth. This can help regulate your breathing.\n    *   *Important:* Do these *gently*. If you start to feel nauseous, stop immediately. The goal is relaxation, not forced breathing.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can sometimes worsen anxiety and the feeling of shortness of breath. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n*   **Avoid Caffeine and Other Stimulants:** Caffeine and other stimulants can exacerbate anxiety and the effects of Vyvanse.\n*   **Manage Anxiety:** Since anxiety can contribute to air hunger, practice relaxation techniques:\n    *   **Meditation:** Even a few minutes of daily meditation can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. There are many free guided meditation apps available.\n    *   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This technique involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body to promote relaxation.\n    *   **Grounding Techniques:** If you're feeling anxious, try grounding techniques like focusing on your senses (e.g., naming five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste).\n*   **Monitor Your Heart Rate and Blood Pressure:** If you have a way to measure your heart rate and blood pressure at home, monitor them regularly and report any significant changes to your doctor.\n\n**When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention**\n\n*   **Severe shortness of breath:** If you're experiencing severe shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain, seek immediate medical attention.\n*   **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, this could indicate a more serious problem.\n*   **Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue:** This could be a sign of an allergic reaction.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Don't Wait Too Long:** While it's reasonable to give the medication a few days to see if the side effects subside, don't wait too long if the air hunger persists or worsens. Your health and well-being are the top priority.\n*   **Communicate Openly with Your Doctor:** Keep your psychiatrist informed about all of your symptoms and concerns. They can help you determine the best course of action.\n*   **Consider a Different Medication:** If Vyvanse is causing intolerable side effects, your doctor may recommend trying a different ADHD medication or a non-stimulant option.\n\nThe bottom line is: call your psychiatrist immediately. In the meantime, try the breathing and relaxation techniques *gently* and stay hydrated. If your symptoms worsen, seek immediate medical care. I hope you find a solution that allows you to manage your ADHD effectively without compromising your singing or well-being.\n"

    "question": "Hi. I just wanna have some guidance in advance if someone can help me :(This hadn't happened to me since March 2020. It happened again last week and sometimes I do feel a bit drowsy or weird but haven't had a full on focal seizure again.What I experienced was:Nausea I saw an aura, or like static? on my right eye that then turned into colors.   My limbs went cold I had a deja vu sensation, like I started to think things I hadn't thought of in two years? I don't know how to explain it I lost all peripheral vision on my right eye for a good while.Speaking was difficult Almost lost consciousness (in 2020 I did lose consciousness and moved my eyes from side to side very rapidly and my face went droopy last time). Back then I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything. Since it never happened again I didn't go see a neurologist but the other day it happened twice so I immediately booked an appointment.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. It sounds like you've experienced a recurrence of some very concerning neurological symptoms, and it's wise of you to seek a neurologist's evaluation. What you've described does sound like it could be related to focal seizures, especially given the aura, deja vu, and visual disturbances.\n\nHere's some guidance and things to consider before your appointment:\n\n**1. Document Everything:**\n\n*   **Detailed Journal:** Start a seizure/symptom journal *immediately*. Record:\n    *   **Date and Time:** Precise time the event started.\n    *   **Duration:** How long did each symptom last?  (e.g., the aura, the deja vu, the vision loss).\n    *   **Description of Symptoms:** Be as specific as possible.\n        *   **Aura:** Describe the static/colors in as much detail as you can remember.  What colors?  What shape? Did it move?\n        *   **Deja Vu:** What specific thoughts or memories returned? Were they related to a specific event?\n        *   **Vision Loss:** How complete was the vision loss? Was it a gradual loss or sudden? Did it recover quickly or slowly?\n        *   **Speech Difficulty:** What kind of difficulty?  Trouble finding words? Slurring?\n        *   **Nausea:** Intensity?  Did you vomit?\n        *   **Drowsiness/Weird Feeling:** Describe the feeling as best you can.\n        *   **Cold Limbs:** Which limbs?  How cold?  Did they feel numb or tingly?\n    *   **Triggers:** What were you doing *immediately* before the event started? Were you stressed?  Sleep-deprived? Had you eaten?  What medications did you take? Had you consumed alcohol?\n    *   **Post-Event:** How did you feel afterward?  Headache? Fatigue? Confusion?  Muscle soreness?\n    *   **Anything Else:** Note anything else unusual that you experienced before, during, or after the event.\n\n*   **Videos (If Possible):** If you feel another episode coming on and it is safe to do so, try to record a video of yourself. This can be incredibly helpful for the neurologist to see what's happening during the event.  Of course, your safety is paramount, so only do this if it doesn't put you at risk.\n\n**2. Prepare for Your Neurologist Appointment:**\n\n*   **Summarize Your History:** Briefly write down your medical history, including any other medical conditions you have, any medications you take (prescription, over-the-counter, and supplements), and any allergies. Also, indicate if anyone in your family has a history of seizures or neurological conditions.\n*   **List of Questions:** Write down any questions you have for the neurologist. Some examples:\n    *   \"Based on my symptoms, what do you think is the most likely cause?\"\n    *   \"What tests do you recommend, and why?\"\n    *   \"What are the treatment options if it is epilepsy/seizures?\"\n    *   \"What are the potential side effects of the medications?\"\n    *   \"What lifestyle changes can I make to help manage these episodes?\"\n    *   \"What should I do if I experience another event?\"\n    *   \"When can I expect to have a diagnosis?\"\n    *   \"What are the restrictions on driving, working, or other activities if I have seizures?\"\n*   **Bring a Support Person (If Possible):** Having someone with you at the appointment can be helpful to take notes, ask questions you might forget, and provide emotional support.\n\n**3. What to Expect at the Neurologist:**\n\n*   **Medical History and Physical Exam:** The neurologist will ask detailed questions about your symptoms, medical history, family history, and lifestyle. They will also perform a neurological exam, which may include testing your reflexes, strength, coordination, sensation, and mental status.\n*   **Diagnostic Tests:** The neurologist will likely order some tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Common tests include:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This test measures the electrical activity in your brain and can help identify abnormal brain waves that are associated with seizures.  Sometimes, they'll recommend sleep-deprived EEG or an ambulatory (24-72 hour) EEG.\n    *   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of the Brain:** This imaging test can help identify structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing seizures (e.g., tumors, lesions, stroke).\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To rule out other medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.\n\n**4. What to Do in the Meantime:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Sleep:** Lack of sleep is a common seizure trigger. Aim for a consistent sleep schedule and get 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n*   **Manage Stress:** Stress can also trigger seizures. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n*   **Avoid Alcohol and Drugs:** These substances can lower the seizure threshold.\n*   **Inform Close Contacts:** Tell trusted family members, friends, or coworkers about your symptoms and what to do if you experience another event.\n*   **Driving:** This is *crucially* important. You *absolutely must* discuss driving with your neurologist. Depending on the laws in your state/country and the frequency of your events, you may be required to stop driving until you are seizure-free for a certain period of time. This is for your safety and the safety of others.\n*   **Be Aware of Potential Triggers:** Try to identify any specific triggers that may be contributing to your seizures (e.g., flashing lights, certain foods, specific times of day).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Focal Seizures:** What you're describing sounds like it could be a focal seizure (previously called partial seizure). Focal seizures start in one area of the brain. They can occur with or without loss of consciousness. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain involved. The aura you experienced would be the beginning of the seizure.\n*   **Epilepsy:** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. If your neurologist determines that you have epilepsy, they will discuss treatment options with you, which may include medication, surgery, or lifestyle changes.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** It's important to remember that other conditions can mimic seizures. The neurologist will need to rule out other possibilities, such as migraines, panic attacks, syncope (fainting), or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).\n*  **Don't self-diagnose:** It's really important to not try to decide this is or isn't seizures by yourself. Let the neurologist take a look at your brain and decide, using the testing they want to run.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\nI hope this helps! I wish you the best of luck with your appointment and hope you get some answers and relief soon.  Remember to be your own advocate and ask lots of questions.\n"

    "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex and concerning constellation of symptoms that definitely warrants professional medical investigation. It's good that you're being observant and trying to understand what's happening. Let's break down the issues and discuss possible next steps, emphasizing that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.\n\n**Summary of Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Age of Onset:** Primarily began around age 12, with some possible earlier episodes (AIWS, vomiting).\n*   **Neurological/Perceptual Symptoms:**\n    *   Difficulty understanding speech (especially during episodes).\n    *   Depersonalization.\n    *   Trembling.\n    *   Ptosis (eyelid drooping).\n    *   Blurry vision.\n    *   Possible Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS).\n    *   Restricted circulation during sleep.\n    *   Foggy hearing.\n    *   Mouth numbness, altered sensation with eating.\n*   **Psychological/Emotional Symptoms:**\n    *   Panic attacks (often associated with other symptoms).\n    *   Anxiety.\n    *   Sensory overload (especially visual and auditory).\n*   **Gastrointestinal Connection:**\n    *   Symptoms strongly linked to food intolerances.\n    *   Relief after bowel movement (passing stool).\n*   **Possible Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** You suspect this based on the characteristics.\n*   **Past Medical History:**\n    *   Blood and heart tested at age 12 (normal).\n    *   Healthy BMI (currently 18.5).\n    *   No family history of stroke or blood clot disorders.\n\n**Key Concerns and Potential Considerations:**\n\n1.  **Neurological Issues:** The speech difficulties, depersonalization, trembling, ptosis, blurry vision, and possible AIWS all point to some kind of neurological involvement.  While you suspect PNES, a neurologist *must* rule out other potential causes.\n2.  **Food Intolerances and Gut-Brain Axis:** The strong correlation with food intolerances and the improvement after a bowel movement suggest a significant gut-brain connection. This is an area of growing research. The gut microbiota can influence the brain and vice versa, triggering a cascade of inflammatory and neurological responses.\n3.  **Anxiety and Panic:** While anxiety and panic attacks are clearly present, it's crucial to determine if they are *primary* or *secondary* to the other symptoms. In other words, are they causing the other symptoms, or are the other symptoms triggering the anxiety/panic?\n4.  **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Although past tests were normal, it's important to reassess for conditions that can manifest with these types of symptoms.\n5.  **Hormonal Influence:** You mention the onset coinciding with puberty. Hormonal fluctuations can sometimes trigger or exacerbate certain conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Neurologist:** This is the *most important* first step. A neurologist can perform a thorough neurological exam, order appropriate tests (EEG, MRI of the brain, etc.), and help determine the underlying cause of your neurological symptoms.  Be sure to tell them about the food intolerances and gut-brain connection you have noticed.\n\n2.  **See a Gastroenterologist:** Due to the strong link with food intolerances, seeing a gastroenterologist is crucial. They can investigate potential food sensitivities or intolerances (e.g., through food elimination diets, allergy testing), and rule out gastrointestinal disorders that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n3.  **Consult a Psychiatrist or Psychologist:**  A mental health professional can help you manage the anxiety and panic attacks. They can also help determine if the anxiety is primary or secondary to your other symptoms, which will inform the best course of treatment. If PNES is suspected, a psychologist or psychiatrist with experience in treating seizure disorders will be vital.\n    *   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be very helpful for managing anxiety and panic.\n    *   Therapy can also help you cope with the emotional distress of living with these symptoms.\n\n4.  **Consider a Functional Medicine Doctor or Integrative Practitioner:** A practitioner with a holistic approach can help you explore the connection between your gut health, neurological function, and mental well-being.\n\n5.  **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Record *everything* you eat, the timing of your symptoms, their severity, and any factors that seem to trigger or alleviate them. This will be invaluable for your healthcare providers.\n\n**Important Considerations for Your Appointments:**\n\n*   **Be Thorough:**  Explain your symptoms clearly and comprehensively. Don't leave anything out, even if it seems embarrassing or unrelated.\n*   **Be Persistent:**  It may take time to find the right diagnosis and treatment. Don't give up if your initial appointments don't provide all the answers.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** You know your body best. If you feel like something isn't being adequately addressed, speak up.\n*   **Bring a Support Person:** If possible, bring a friend or family member to your appointments to help you remember information and advocate for you.\n\n**In summary, your symptoms are complex and require a multidisciplinary approach. Please see a neurologist and gastroenterologist as soon as possible to begin the diagnostic process. They are the most qualified to evaluate your symptoms and make appropriate recommendations. It is possible to treat and manage your symptoms, do not be discouraged and have hope.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** *This information is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the Keppra side effects and how to potentially manage them. It's good you're being proactive and trying to find the best way to take your medication. It's important to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. *Always* consult with your neurologist or prescribing doctor before making any changes to your medication schedule or dosage. They have your full medical history and can provide personalized recommendations.\n\nThat being said, here's some general information and considerations regarding Keppra and its side effects:\n\n**Common Keppra Side Effects:**\n\n*   **Fatigue and Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose.\n*   **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.\n*   **Weakness:** General lack of energy.\n*   **Headache:** Head pain.\n*   **Irritability and Mood Changes:**  Keppra can sometimes be associated with mood swings, aggression, or depression in some individuals (sometimes referred to as \"Keppra rage\").\n*   **Cognitive Issues (\"Brain Fog\"):** Difficulty concentrating, memory problems, feeling mentally slowed down. This is what you're describing.\n\n**Why You Might Be Feeling \"Foggy\" or \"Drunk\":**\n\n*   **Keppra Level Fluctuations:** Even with once-a-day dosing, the level of Keppra in your blood will fluctuate throughout the day. The peak concentration after taking the dose might be causing the \"foggy\" feeling.\n*   **Dosage Too High:** Even though it's a common starting dose, 1000mg once a day may be too high for *you*.  Individual responses to medications vary greatly.\n*   **Tolerance:** Sometimes, side effects lessen over time as your body adjusts to the medication. However, in your case, it sounds like it's been persistent.\n*   **Interaction with Motrin:** While a direct interaction between Keppra and Motrin is less likely to be the primary cause of the fogginess, it is still a possibility. Motrin (ibuprofen) can affect kidney function, and since Keppra is primarily cleared by the kidneys, altered kidney function *could* theoretically influence Keppra levels, though this is less common.\n*   **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Though less probable, if you have underlying and perhaps unknown kidney issues, Keppra could cause you to feel sluggish and drunk.\n\n**What You Can Discuss With Your Doctor:**\n\n1.  **Timing of Dose:**\n    *   **Bedtime:** Taking Keppra at bedtime might help minimize the daytime fogginess. The peak concentration would occur while you're asleep. However, some people find that taking it before bed disrupts their sleep.\n    *   **With Food:** Taking Keppra with food might slow down the absorption rate, leading to a more gradual rise in blood levels and potentially reducing the peak concentration and side effects.\n    *   **Splitting the Dose:** Even though you're currently on once-a-day dosing, ask your doctor about the possibility of splitting the dose back into twice a day, but at a *lower* dose each time (e.g., 500mg twice a day). This can sometimes result in more stable blood levels and fewer side effects. This would be a discussion to have with your doctor since that is what you previously did not like, but maybe at a lower dosage, it could be beneficial.\n    *   **Monitor When you feel these side effects:** Keep a symptom journal and note the times you take your Keppra so you can track the frequency and level of side effects.\n\n2.  **Dosage Adjustment:** This is the most important thing to discuss. Your doctor might consider lowering the dose of Keppra to see if that reduces the side effects while still controlling your seizures. They may also suggest blood tests to determine levels of the medication.\n\n3.  **Alternative Medications:** If the side effects are truly intolerable and affecting your quality of life, discuss other anti-epileptic medications with your doctor. There are many different options available, and what works best varies from person to person.\n\n4.  **Kidney Function Test:** Ask your doctor to run some blood tests to check kidney function.\n\n5.  **Discuss Other Medical Issues:** Let your doctor know about all other medications you are taking or any other ailments.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Never Stop Keppra Abruptly:** Suddenly stopping Keppra can increase the risk of seizures. Always work with your doctor to make any changes to your medication regimen.\n*   **Be Patient:** Finding the right medication and dosage for epilepsy can be a process of trial and error. It may take some time to find the best solution for you.\n*   **Driving:** If you're feeling \"foggy\" or \"drunk,\" *do not drive* or operate heavy machinery. This is very dangerous.\n*   **Communication is Key:** Keep an open and honest dialogue with your neurologist about your side effects and how they are impacting your life. The more information you provide, the better they can help you find the right treatment plan.\n\n**In summary:** The fogginess you're experiencing is a known side effect of Keppra. The best course of action is to discuss your symptoms with your neurologist. They can assess your individual situation, consider dosage adjustments, timing, and possibly alternative medications to find the optimal treatment plan for you.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss these concerns. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Age - 30   Sex - male    Height - 5'8\"-174 cm    Weight - 60 kgs.    Duration of complaint - 3 years    Location - Soft palate    Any existing relevant medical issues - Subjective Tinnitus caused by olanzapine and an MRI scan   Current medications - Cinolazepam for sleep, Mysoline for the myoclonus. Is palatal myoclonus treatable?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the information and address the treatability of palatal myoclonus, given your situation.\n\n**Understanding Your Information**\n\n*   **Age, Sex, Height, Weight:** 30 years old, male, 5'8\" (174 cm), 60 kgs (approximately 132 lbs). This puts you in the lower end of a healthy BMI range. This is important to consider, as certain nutrient deficiencies can sometimes contribute to neurological issues.\n*   **Duration:** 3 years of palatal myoclonus. This is considered a chronic condition.\n*   **Location:** Soft palate. This specifically points to palatal myoclonus.\n*   **Relevant Medical Issues:**\n    *   **Subjective Tinnitus (from Olanzapine):** This is important because medications and their side effects can sometimes interact or complicate other neurological conditions. While you're not currently taking Olanzapine (I presume, since it caused the tinnitus), the past exposure could be relevant.\n    *   **MRI Scan:** The results of this scan are **crucial**.  The MRI helps determine the *cause* of the palatal myoclonus. Did the MRI show any abnormalities in the brainstem (specifically the inferior olivary nucleus), cerebellum, or other relevant areas? What was the date and indication for the scan?\n*   **Current Medications:**\n    *   **Cinolazepam (for sleep):** A benzodiazepine. These can sometimes have side effects that affect neurological function, but are unlikely to be directly causing palatal myoclonus.\n    *   **Mysoline (Primidone) (for myoclonus):**  This is a barbiturate anticonvulsant and is *often* used to treat myoclonus, including palatal myoclonus. The fact that you're taking it suggests that your doctor has already considered myoclonus as a diagnosis and is attempting treatment.\n\n**Palatal Myoclonus: Is it Treatable?**\n\nThe answer is **it depends on the cause and severity, but often, yes, there are treatments that can significantly improve symptoms.**  Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1.  **Types of Palatal Myoclonus (Etiology):**\n    *   **Essential/Idiopathic Palatal Myoclonus:** This is when no specific cause can be identified on MRI. Sometimes it's thought to be related to prior viral infections or other subtle injuries that don't show up on imaging.\n    *   **Symptomatic Palatal Myoclonus:** This is where there's a clear underlying cause identified on MRI. The most common cause is a lesion (damage) in the brainstem pathway involving the inferior olivary nucleus. This lesion can be caused by stroke, trauma, multiple sclerosis, tumor, or other neurological conditions.\n\n2.  **Treatment Options:**\n\n    *   **Medications:**\n        *   **Primidone (Mysoline):** You are already on this. It's a first-line medication for myoclonus, and it can be effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of the palatal movements.  It may take time to find the optimal dose.\n        *   **Clonazepam:** Another benzodiazepine that is sometimes used to treat myoclonus. However, you're already on Cinolazepam.\n        *   **Gabapentin or Pregabalin:** These are anticonvulsants that can sometimes help with myoclonus, especially if there is a neuropathic component.\n        *   **Other Medications:** In some cases, other medications like Tetrabenazine, Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, or even anti-epileptic drugs may be considered.\n\n    *   **Botulinum Toxin (Botox) Injections:**\n        *   This is a common and often effective treatment for palatal myoclonus, *especially* when the medication response is not sufficient.\n        *   Botox is injected directly into the palatal muscles (levator veli palatini or tensor veli palatini). This weakens the muscles, reducing the myoclonic movements.\n        *   The effects are temporary (typically lasting 3-6 months), so repeat injections are usually needed.\n\n    *   **Surgery:**\n        *   Surgery is rare and usually reserved for severe, refractory cases of *symptomatic* palatal myoclonus where a specific lesion can be targeted.\n\n3.  **Factors Affecting Treatability:**\n\n    *   **Underlying Cause:** Symptomatic palatal myoclonus may be harder to treat if the underlying cause is progressive or untreatable.\n    *   **Severity:** Mild cases may be more easily managed with medication than severe cases.\n    *   **Individual Response:** People respond differently to medications and treatments. What works for one person may not work for another.\n    *   **Side Effects:** Medications can have side effects that limit their use.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Review MRI:** Very carefully review the results of the MRI scan that was previously carried out. Get a copy of the radiologist's report and, ideally, the images themselves. Understand what the MRI showed (or didn't show). This is the *most* important piece of information for determining the cause and best treatment strategy.\n2.  **Neurologist Consultation:** You need to be under the care of a neurologist, ideally one with experience in movement disorders. Discuss your symptoms, medications, and MRI results with the neurologist.\n3.  **Medication Optimization:** Work with your neurologist to optimize your Mysoline dosage and explore other medication options if Mysoline is not providing adequate relief.\n4.  **Consider Botox Injections:** If medications are not fully controlling your symptoms, discuss Botox injections into the soft palate with your neurologist.\n5.  **Address Contributing Factors:** Ensure you have a healthy diet and lifestyle. While not a direct cure, optimizing your overall health can sometimes improve neurological symptoms.\n6.  **Tinnitus Management:** Continue to address your tinnitus, as it can be exacerbated by stress and lack of sleep. Good sleep hygiene is especially important.\n\n**In summary, palatal myoclonus *is* often treatable, but the best approach depends on identifying the underlying cause (if possible) and working with a neurologist to find the right combination of medications and/or Botox injections.** I would strongly recommend seeing a neurologist that specialises in movement disorders.\n"

    "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

    "answer": "Okay, I understand. You're seeking insights into your MRI given your complex medical history, and specifically concerned about the right side of your brain following your CVST in 2019. It's understandable you're seeking more information and considering your options before potentially consulting a specialist at a place like Cornell.\n\n**Before I can provide any input, I need to state clearly that I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations. My comments below are for informational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice. You MUST discuss your MRI results and health concerns with your doctor, who can accurately interpret the images in the context of your full medical history.**\n\nHere's how I can *potentially* help, based on the information you've provided and your desire to understand more about your MRI:\n\n1.  **Understanding MRI Basics:**\n    *   MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain.\n    *   Different MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, etc.) highlight different tissue characteristics. For example, T2 and FLAIR sequences are more sensitive to fluid and inflammation.\n    *   Areas of prior blood clots or damage can show up as changes in the brain tissue on MRI.\n\n2.  **What *I* can do with an image:**\n\n    *   *Describe the view*: I can describe what the image is showing, the plane (axial, sagittal, coronal), and identify major brain structures like the lobes, ventricles, etc.\n    *   *Identify obvious areas*: I can point out areas that appear \"different\" from the surrounding brain tissue. These are likely to be areas your doctor is already aware of.\n\n3.  **What *I* *cannot* do:**\n\n    *   *Diagnose anything*: I can't say *what* any abnormality is (e.g., scar tissue, inflammation, etc.).\n    *   *Interpret the clinical significance*: I can't say how any MRI findings correlate with your symptoms.\n    *   *Give treatment recommendations*: I am not qualified to advise you on your medication or treatment plan.\n\n**How to Proceed:**\n\n1.  **Share the Image:** Please share the image you feel is most relevant. A T2 or FLAIR image in the axial plane that focuses on the areas affected by your CVST (right side, superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, jugular) would be a good starting point.\n2.  **Tell me what you're concerned about:** Be specific about what you're looking for. For example, \"I'm concerned about any signs of re-occlusion of the sinus\" or \"I'm concerned about areas of brain damage near where the clot was.\"\n3.  **Understand My Limitations:** Remember, I am an AI. My input is *not* a substitute for your doctor's expertise.\n\n**Important Considerations Given Your History:**\n\n*   **CVST and its Sequelae:** A CVST can lead to venous infarction (brain damage due to lack of blood flow), edema (swelling), and increased intracranial pressure. MRI is used to assess these things.\n*   **Epilepsy and Temporal Lobe:** The right temporal lobe is where your seizures originate. MRI is important to rule out any structural cause for the epilepsy (scarring, malformations, etc.).\n*   **Factor V Leiden:** This genetic condition increases your risk of blood clots. It's essential to stay on anticoagulation medication like Eliquis to prevent further thrombotic events.\n*   **Your Symptoms:** It's important to discuss all your symptoms (temperature regulation, sleep disturbances, etc.) with your doctor to determine if they are related to the CVST, epilepsy, medication side effects, or other conditions.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"What are the key findings on my MRI, specifically in the area of my previous CVST?\"\n*   \"Is there any evidence of new clot formation or changes in the sinuses?\"\n*   \"Is there any evidence of brain damage (infarction, gliosis) related to the CVST or epilepsy?\"\n*   \"How do the MRI findings correlate with my symptoms (seizures, vision problems, etc.)?\"\n*   \"What are the risks and benefits of further evaluation at a specialized center like Cornell?\"\n\n**Bottom Line:** Your case is complex, and requires a thorough evaluation by a neurologist with expertise in cerebrovascular disease and epilepsy. Sharing the MRI image is the first step in helping me potentially provide some basic informational input, *but it cannot replace a consultation with your doctor*.\n"

    "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your concerns about radiation exposure from your CT scans and PET scan, and try to put them into perspective.  It's understandable to be worried, especially after a period of intense medical investigation.\n\n**Understanding Radiation Dose and DLP**\n\n*   **Radiation Dose:**  Medical imaging uses ionizing radiation, which carries a small risk of causing cellular damage that *could* lead to cancer years or decades later. This is why doctors strive to minimize radiation exposure (\"as low as reasonably achievable,\" or ALARA).\n\n*   **DLP (Dose-Length Product):**  DLP is a measure of the total radiation delivered during a CT scan.  It's calculated by multiplying the radiation dose at a specific point by the length of the scan. DLP is measured in milligray-centimeters (mGy-cm). The higher the DLP, the higher the radiation dose. It is used as an estimate of the radiation dose of a CT scan to the body.\n\n**Estimating Effective Dose**\n\nDLP isn't the *effective dose* (measured in Sieverts (Sv) or millisieverts (mSv)), which is a standardized measure that takes into account the sensitivity of different organs to radiation.  To get from DLP to effective dose, you need to use conversion factors that depend on the body region scanned.  Here are some *approximate* conversions:\n\n*   **Head CT:** Effective Dose (mSv) \u2248 DLP (mGy-cm) * 0.0021\n*   **Chest CT:** Effective Dose (mSv) \u2248 DLP (mGy-cm) * 0.0054\n*   **Abdomen/Pelvis CT:** Effective Dose (mSv) \u2248 DLP (mGy-cm) * 0.015\n*   **Full Body PET:** Effective Dose (mSv) \u2248 ??? (Complex and depends on the radiotracer used and the scan parameters. It's definitely the highest dose of the group.)\n\nLet's estimate your effective dose from the CT scans:\n\n*   Aug 16 Head: 1005.29 * 0.0021 = ~2.11 mSv\n*   Sept 22 Head: 799 * 0.0021 = ~1.68 mSv\n*   Sept 23 Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: (652 * 0.0054) + (652 * 0.015) = ~13.21 mSv\n*   Sept 25 Head: 763 * 0.0021 = ~1.60 mSv\n*   Nov 15 Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: (1291.11 * 0.0054) + (1291.11 * 0.015) = ~26.16 mSv\n*   Dec 15 Head: 881.17 * 0.0021 = ~1.85 mSv\n\n**Total Estimated CT Dose: ~46.61 mSv**\n\n**Putting Your Exposure in Perspective**\n\nHere's how your estimated radiation exposure from CT scans compares to other sources and occupations:\n\n*   **Natural Background Radiation:** The average person receives about 3 mSv per year from natural sources (cosmic rays, radon in the air, radioactive materials in the earth, etc.).  So, your CT scans are equivalent to about 15 years worth of background radiation.\n*   **Airline Pilots and Flight Attendants:** Pilots can receive an extra 2-9 mSv per year due to cosmic radiation at high altitudes. Your dose is higher than a year or two for a pilot.\n*   **Radiation Workers:**  Regulatory limits for radiation workers (e.g., nuclear power plant employees, radiographers) vary by country but are typically around 20-50 mSv per year.  Your CT dose is on the lower end of what radiation workers might experience *in a single year*.\n*   **Radiation Therapy:**  Cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy receive *much* higher doses, often in the range of 20,000-80,000 mSv (20-80 Sieverts) delivered to a localized area over a period of weeks.  Your dose is orders of magnitude lower.\n*   **PET Scan:** A typical PET scan delivers an effective dose of 5-10 mSv. However, a full-body PET scan can have a wider range due to the type of radiotracer used.\n\n**Key Considerations and Reassurance**\n\n1.  **Increased Risk is Small:** While any exposure to ionizing radiation carries a theoretical increased risk of cancer, the risk from your CT scans is generally considered small. The increased risk is difficult to quantify precisely and is spread over a lifetime.\n2.  **Benefits vs. Risks:**  The CT scans were performed because doctors needed to diagnose your complex neurological issues. The potential benefits of accurate diagnosis and treatment outweighed the small radiation risk.  You received empirical treatment based on those scans.\n3.  **Age Matters:**  Younger people are generally more susceptible to the effects of radiation.  At 32, you're not considered a child, where the risks are higher.\n4.  **Linear No-Threshold (LNT) Model:** The assumption that any radiation exposure carries some risk is based on the LNT model. Some scientists debate this model, suggesting that low doses of radiation may not be harmful or may even have a protective effect (hormesis), but LNT remains the conservative, accepted model for regulatory purposes.\n5.  **Individual Susceptibility:**  Everyone's susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer varies based on genetics, lifestyle, and other factors.\n6.  **PET Scan Matters:** The biggest unknown is the radiation dose of the \"Full body PET scan\". If it was 20 mSv, your total accumulated dose would be roughly 67 mSv. If it was 40 mSv it would be roughly 87 mSv. It is important to know this value as the radiation does delivered during these scans are noticeably higher than head scans.\n\n**What You Can Do Now**\n\n*   **Focus on a Healthy Lifestyle:** A healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption can all help reduce your overall cancer risk.\n*   **Routine Cancer Screenings:** Follow recommended cancer screening guidelines for your age and gender.\n*   **Communicate with Your Doctor:** Discuss your concerns with your doctor. They can assess your individual risk factors and provide personalized advice.\n\n**Moving Forward**\n\nIt's understandable to have these worries, but dwelling on them won't improve your health.  The radiation exposure from your CT scans is unlikely to have a significant impact on your long-term cancer risk.  The important thing is that you received the medical care you needed, you are improving, and you are taking steps to live a healthy life.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI Chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're seeing a lot about the vagus nerve lately. It's definitely become a buzzword in wellness circles. Let's break down what it is, what it does, and whether the claims surrounding its stimulation are legit.\n\n**What is the Vagus Nerve?**\n\n*   The vagus nerve is the longest and most complex cranial nerve in the body. It's like a superhighway connecting your brain to many major organs, including:\n    *   Heart\n    *   Lungs\n    *   Gut (stomach, intestines)\n    *   Liver\n    *   Kidneys\n    *   Pancreas\n*   \"Vagus\" comes from the Latin word for \"wandering,\" because it meanders throughout the body, reaching so many different areas.\n*   It's a *mixed* nerve, meaning it carries both sensory and motor signals.\n    *   **Sensory:** It sends information *from* your organs *to* your brain about their state (e.g., fullness in your stomach, heart rate changes, etc.).\n    *   **Motor:** It sends signals *from* your brain *to* your organs, influencing their function (e.g., slowing heart rate, stimulating digestion).\n\n**What Does the Vagus Nerve Do? Key Functions:**\n\nThe vagus nerve plays a crucial role in many essential bodily functions. Here's a summary:\n\n*   **The Parasympathetic Nervous System:** The vagus nerve is a *major* component of the parasympathetic nervous system, often called the \"rest and digest\" system. It helps your body conserve energy, slow down after stress, and promote relaxation.\n*   **Heart Rate Regulation:** It helps lower your heart rate and blood pressure.\n*   **Digestion:** It stimulates stomach acid production, digestive enzyme release, and gut motility (the movement of food through your digestive system).\n*   **Breathing:** It influences the rate and depth of your breathing.\n*   **Immune Function:** It has anti-inflammatory effects and can modulate the immune system.\n*   **Mood Regulation:** It plays a role in anxiety, depression, and overall emotional well-being, in part by communicating with the brain about the state of the gut (the gut-brain axis).\n*   **Swallowing and Speech:** It controls muscles in the throat and voice box.\n*   **Taste:** It carries some taste information.\n\n**Does Vagus Nerve Stimulation Have the Positive Effects Claimed?**\n\nThis is where things get a bit nuanced. *Yes*, stimulating the vagus nerve *can* have positive effects, but the extent and reliability of those effects vary.\n\n*   **Established Medical Uses:**\n    *   **Epilepsy:** Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an *approved* treatment for epilepsy in some cases. A device is implanted to send electrical pulses to the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Depression:** VNS is also used to treat treatment-resistant depression.\n*   **Potential Benefits Still Being Investigated (More Research Needed):**\n    *   **Anxiety:** Some studies suggest VNS may help reduce anxiety symptoms, but more research is needed to determine the most effective methods and populations.\n    *   **Inflammation:** Because the vagus nerve has anti-inflammatory properties, it's being investigated for conditions involving chronic inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n    *   **Digestive Issues:** Some people find that stimulating the vagus nerve helps with digestive problems like bloating, constipation, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), but again, the evidence is not conclusive.\n    *   **Heart Health:** VNS is being explored as a potential therapy for heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions.\n\n**Methods of Stimulating the Vagus Nerve:**\n\nHere are some common methods people use, ranging from medically established to more anecdotal:\n\n*   **Medical VNS (Implanted Device):** This is the most direct form of stimulation and is used for epilepsy and depression.\n*   **Non-Invasive VNS (nVNS):** This involves using a device to deliver electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve through the skin, often on the ear or neck. It's less invasive than implanted VNS.\n*   **Lifestyle Practices (Self-Stimulation):** These are things you can do at home to potentially stimulate the vagus nerve:\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) is thought to stimulate the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Cold Exposure:** Splashing cold water on your face or taking a cold shower can activate the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Singing, Humming, Chanting:** These activities can stimulate the vagus nerve because it connects to the vocal cords.\n    *   **Gargling:** Gargling vigorously can stimulate the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Meditation and Mindfulness:** These practices can promote relaxation and increase vagal tone (the activity level of the vagus nerve).\n    *   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve vagal tone.\n    *   **Yoga and Tai Chi:** These practices combine movement, breathing, and mindfulness, which may stimulate the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Probiotics:** Because the vagus nerve connects the gut and brain, a healthy gut microbiome may support vagal nerve function.\n    *   **Massage:** Certain types of massage, particularly those focused on the neck and shoulders, may stimulate the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Social Connection:** Positive social interactions and relationships can stimulate the vagus nerve and promote well-being.\n\n**Is Stimulating the Vagus Nerve Bullshit?**\n\n*   **Not entirely.** The vagus nerve is a real and important nerve with significant effects on the body.\n*   **The hype is overblown.** Many of the claims you see online are exaggerated or lack strong scientific evidence. The effectiveness of self-stimulation methods can vary greatly from person to person.\n*   **It's not a magic bullet.** While stimulating the vagus nerve *can* be helpful, it's not a cure-all for every ailment. It's important to have realistic expectations.\n*   **Context is Key.** It's important to note that studies of vagus nerve stimulation are often conducted in specific populations (e.g., people with epilepsy, people with depression). It's not always clear whether the results can be generalized to the general population.\n*   **Consider it part of a holistic approach.** Lifestyle practices that stimulate the vagus nerve are generally safe and can be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle that includes proper nutrition, exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep.\n\n**Important Considerations for You (Given Your Information):**\n\n*   **Sertraline:** You're taking sertraline, an SSRI antidepressant. If you're considering using vagus nerve stimulation (especially non-invasive VNS devices) to manage anxiety or depression, it's *crucial* to discuss this with your doctor *first*. VNS might interact with your medication or affect your treatment plan. Don't make changes to your medication regimen without medical guidance.\n*   **Anxiety and Depression:** While lifestyle-based vagus nerve stimulation techniques are generally safe, they may not be sufficient to treat significant anxiety or depression. It's important to have a comprehensive treatment plan that may include therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes.\n*   **Digestive Issues:** If you have digestive problems, see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n*   **Your Doctor Knows Best:** Always consult with your doctor or another qualified healthcare professional before starting any new treatment, including vagus nerve stimulation techniques. They can help you determine if it's safe and appropriate for you, given your medical history and current medications.\n\n**In summary:** The vagus nerve is a vital part of your body's communication system, and stimulating it can have potential benefits. While lifestyle methods of self-stimulation are generally safe, it's essential to be realistic about their effectiveness and talk to your doctor if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications. Don't let the hype lead you to believe it's a miracle cure. Focus on a balanced approach to health and well-being, and always prioritize professional medical advice.\n"

    "question": "i was diagnosed when i was young with a seizure thing that goes away when youre 13, which impairs my ability to concentrate and gave me seizures while im sleeping about once every blood moon and my mom told me it was epilepsy, but see the thing is that shes not very good with english, and i have never had any trouble with seeing flashing lights. is it possible to have epilepsy but no trouble with seeing flashing colors?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Yes, it is absolutely possible to have epilepsy without being sensitive to flashing lights (photosensitivity).  In fact, photosensitive epilepsy is a relatively small subset of all epilepsy cases.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Epilepsy is a broad term:** Epilepsy isn't a single disease. It's a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, with various causes and triggers.\n\n*   **Seizure triggers vary:**  While flashing lights are a well-known trigger, they are not the *only* trigger, or even a common one for many people with epilepsy.  Other triggers can include stress, lack of sleep, hormonal changes, illness, specific patterns, and even, in some cases, nothing identifiable at all.\n\n*   **Photosensitive epilepsy is specific:** Photosensitive epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where seizures are specifically triggered by flashing or flickering lights or certain visual patterns. Only about 3% of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy.\n\n*   **Age-related epilepsy:**  You mentioned a \"seizure thing that goes away when you're 13.\" This could potentially be something like Benign Rolandic Epilepsy (also known as Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes - BECTS).  This is a common childhood epilepsy that often resolves by adolescence.  Seizures in BECTS are often nocturnal (happening during sleep).\n\n*   **\"Blood moon\" is likely coincidental:** The timing with the \"blood moon\" is almost certainly coincidental. Seizures that occur infrequently might *seem* linked to something, but that's often just due to chance.\n\n**Given your history, here's what's important:**\n\n1.  **Clarify the Diagnosis:** Since your mother received the diagnosis, it's crucial to get official documentation from your doctor and understand the specific type of seizure disorder you were diagnosed with. Knowing the specific type (if possible) is essential for understanding the likelihood of recurrence and managing it. If you don't have this information, you should contact the doctor who made the diagnosis. Medical records are usually kept, and you have a right to access them.\n\n2.  **Consult a Neurologist:** It's essential to see a neurologist, especially since you are now older. They can:\n    *   Review your past medical history and records.\n    *   Determine if you truly had epilepsy, and if so, what type.\n    *   Assess whether you are still at risk for seizures. Even if the childhood condition typically resolves, it's wise to get a professional opinion.\n    *   Discuss any current symptoms or concerns you have.\n    *   Explain your risk factors and what to do if you experience any further seizure-like activity.\n\n3. **Be Prepared:** Write down all the details you remember about the seizures, the diagnosis, and anything your mom told you. This will help the doctor understand your history.\n\nIn summary, the lack of photosensitivity doesn't rule out epilepsy. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and management plan from a neurologist. They can assess your history, determine if you have ongoing risks, and provide guidance on how to manage your health.\n"

    "question": "Does radiation necrosis heal? 31 female 155 lbs Diagnosed w/ Brain AVM & 2 aneurysms 2009. - 3 gamma knife treatments in 2019. edications: Topamax, Trileptal, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Clonidine, Vyvanse, Vitamin D, Folic Acid & had Kyleena IUD replaced February 16th. - important because vision symptoms started could be coincidence. Shortly after I had my new iud put in I started having issues with my left eye, vision became blurry\u201dish\u201d on and off. For the next 3 weeks I Had slow thought processing during the time & some confusion. - Hard time finding words. I also had some \u201cleft neglect\u201d symptoms but that\u2019s normal for me when I get migraines because my left side goes numb so I related all of this to stress & the migraines until I started having muscle twitching in my left hand & wrist. - I started to improve end of March but My vision is still off sometimes & I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be. I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me? No one has ever told me I had radiation necrosis. I guess I was always under the assumption my brain would heal itself after my radiation\u2026 but 4 years later it just seems to be getting worse. Does radiation necrosis heal/is it dangerous? Could this just be swelling? Did is progress fast from January 2022-April 2023? 4.. Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as a ischemic stroke? What is FLAIR hyperintensity? Those are just questions off the top of my head. I don\u2019t see a dr until June and google is not my friend.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and the information from your MRI report, keeping in mind I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. It's crucial to discuss this with your doctors, especially the neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist involved in your care. This information is for educational purposes only.\n\n**Understanding Radiation Necrosis**\n\n*   **What it is:** Radiation necrosis is a complication that can occur after radiation therapy, including Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS). It happens when the radiation damages healthy brain tissue, leading to cell death and inflammation. It can develop months or even years after treatment.\n\n*   **Does it heal?** This is a complex question. Radiation necrosis *can* improve over time, especially with treatment, but it may not completely resolve.  The extent of healing depends on the severity of the damage, the location, and the individual's response to treatment.  Sometimes, the damaged tissue is replaced by scar tissue.\n\n*   **Is it dangerous?** Yes, radiation necrosis can be dangerous. It can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including:\n    *   Headaches\n    *   Seizures\n    *   Weakness or numbness\n    *   Vision problems\n    *   Cognitive difficulties (memory, concentration, word-finding)\n    *   Changes in personality or behavior\n\n**Interpreting Your Symptoms and Potential Connection to Radiation Necrosis**\n\nYour symptoms (blurry vision, slow thought processing, word-finding difficulties, muscle twitching, and left neglect) *could* be related to radiation necrosis, especially given your history of GKRS. However, it's important to consider other possibilities:\n\n*   **Migraines:** Migraines can definitely cause neurological symptoms like vision changes, confusion, and weakness.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** Some of your medications (Topamax, Trileptal, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Clonidine, Vyvanse) can have neurological side effects that could contribute to your symptoms.\n*   **IUD:** While less likely, hormonal changes can sometimes affect neurological conditions.  It's good that you're considering this as a possible factor, even if it seems like a coincidence.\n*   **Underlying AVM/Aneurysms:**  While treated, it's important to monitor for any changes related to the original AVM or aneurysms.\n*   **Seizures:** The muscle twitching you described could potentially be related to seizure activity.\n*    **Stress/Anxiety:** Stress can exasterbate most symptoms so that's something important to be aware of.\n\n**Answering Your Specific Questions**\n\n1.  **\"Does radiation necrosis heal/is it dangerous?\"** As stated above, it *can* improve with treatment but it may not fully heal.  It is potentially dangerous and needs to be properly managed.\n\n2.  **\"Could this just be swelling?\"** Swelling (edema) is a component of radiation necrosis. The inflammation from the damaged tissue causes swelling, which contributes to the symptoms. Treatment often aims to reduce this swelling.\n\n3.  **\"Did it progress fast from January 2022-April 2023?\"** That is not enough information to make that assessment. You'd need to compare the reports side by side to see if that time frame reveals it being \u201cfast.\u201d\n\n4.  **\"Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as a ischemic stroke?\"**  While both involve reduced oxygen to brain tissue, they are different processes.  An ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage of a blood vessel, preventing blood flow to a specific area.  Radiation necrosis is damage to the brain tissue itself, which *can* disrupt blood flow to the affected area, but the primary cause is the radiation-induced tissue injury. The result can be similar (tissue damage due to lack of oxygen), but the underlying mechanism is different.\n\n5.  **\"What is FLAIR hyperintensity?\"** FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is a type of MRI sequence that is very sensitive to fluid changes in the brain. FLAIR hyperintensity (meaning brighter areas on the FLAIR image) often indicates:\n    *   **Edema (swelling):** Fluid accumulation in the brain tissue.\n    *   **Inflammation:** A sign of an active inflammatory process.\n    *   **Demyelination:** Damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers.\n    *   **Gliosis:** Scarring in the brain tissue.\n    *   In the context of radiation necrosis, FLAIR hyperintensity is a common finding, indicating the presence of edema and inflammation around the area of necrosis.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Doctors:** This is the MOST important step. Schedule a detailed discussion with your neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, and neurologist. Bring a list of your symptoms and concerns. Ask them to explain the MRI findings in detail and discuss the potential diagnosis of radiation necrosis.\n\n2.  **Review the MRI Images:** Ask your doctor to show you the MRI images and explain the specific areas of concern. Comparing your previous and new images is crucial to assess any progression.\n\n3.  **Discuss Treatment Options:** If radiation necrosis is suspected, discuss treatment options. Common treatments include:\n    *   **Corticosteroids (e.g., Dexamethasone):** To reduce swelling and inflammation.\n    *   **Bevacizumab (Avastin):** An anti-VEGF antibody that can help reduce edema and improve symptoms.\n    *   **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT):** May promote healing.\n    *   **Surgery:** In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the necrotic tissue.\n\n4.  **Consider Other Evaluations:** Your doctor may want to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as seizures, migraines, or medication side effects. This might involve further EEG monitoring or medication adjustments.\n\n5.  **Keep a Symptom Journal:** Track your symptoms, including their frequency, severity, and any triggers. This information will be valuable for your doctors in assessing your condition and treatment response.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Early Diagnosis and Treatment:** Early diagnosis and treatment of radiation necrosis are crucial for improving outcomes and preventing further damage.\n*   **Long-Term Monitoring:** Even if you receive treatment and your symptoms improve, you will likely need long-term monitoring with regular MRI scans to watch for recurrence or progression of radiation necrosis.\n*   **Quality of Life:** The symptoms of radiation necrosis can significantly impact your quality of life. It's important to work with your doctors to manage your symptoms and maintain your overall well-being.\n\nDon't hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek the best possible care. By working closely with your medical team, you can gain a better understanding of your condition and develop a plan to manage it effectively.\n"

    "question": "Sex: M Age 48 Weight 235lbs Height: 6ft 2\" non smoker, non drinker epilepsy since birth, had his hemispheres separated about 15 years ago. Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It sounds like you're going through a lot, and it's commendable that you're so involved and supportive of your husband. Dealing with increasing seizure frequency and severity is understandably concerning. Let's break down the situation and discuss potential avenues for improvement.\n\n**Key Concerns and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Increasing Seizure Frequency:** The fact that the seizures are becoming more frequent over the past 7 years is definitely a reason to re-evaluate the treatment plan. Simply increasing medication dosage might not be the most effective long-term strategy.\n*   **Headaches as a Prodrome:** The headaches preceding the seizures are significant. They strongly suggest a focal onset, meaning the seizures are likely originating from a specific area in the brain, even though they generalize into larger seizures.\n*   **Calcification:** While the neurologist says the calcification is \"normal and unchanged,\" it's worth exploring *why* it's there and if it could be contributing to the seizures. Calcification can be caused by a variety of things, some of which could be relevant to seizure management (old infection, injury, etc.) While \"unchanged\" can be reassuring, it doesn't necessarily mean it's benign in terms of its contribution to his epilepsy.\n*   **Medication:** Tegretol (carbamazepine) is a common anti-epileptic drug (AED). The anti-depressant is also important to consider as some can lower the seizure threshold. It's crucial to review *all* medications with the neurologist.\n*   **Postictal State:** The varying length of the postictal state (10 minutes to an hour) is also something to monitor. Prolonged postictal states can indicate a more significant seizure event.\n*   **Impact on Quality of Life:** Frequent seizures, and the anxiety surrounding them, can significantly impact quality of life for both your husband and you.\n\n**Possible Steps and Questions to Ask the Neurologist:**\n\nGiven the above concerns, it's important to advocate for a more thorough evaluation. Here's a list of questions and steps you might consider:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the Diagnosis and Seizure Type:**\n    *   \"Is it possible to pinpoint the origin of the seizures, given the headaches that precede them?\" (i.e., rule out focal seizures)\n    *   \"Are there other types of epilepsy that need to be considered, given the changing pattern?\"\n\n2.  **Advanced Imaging:**\n    *   **MRI with Epilepsy Protocol:** Ask about getting an MRI with a specific \"epilepsy protocol.\" This type of MRI uses higher resolution and specific sequences to look for subtle abnormalities that might be missed on a standard CT scan or MRI.\n    *   **fMRI (functional MRI):** If a specific area is suspected, an fMRI might help map brain function around the calcification and potential seizure focus.\n    *   **PET Scan:** A PET scan can sometimes identify areas of abnormal brain metabolism that might be contributing to seizures.\n    *   **MEG (Magnetoencephalography):** MEG is a non-invasive test that measures the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain. It can help pinpoint the source of seizures.\n\n3.  **EEG Monitoring:**\n    *   **Long-Term EEG Monitoring (LTM):** A longer EEG recording (days to weeks, often done as an inpatient) increases the chance of capturing a seizure and identifying the seizure onset zone.\n    *   **Ambulatory EEG:** An ambulatory EEG can be done at home over several days to monitor brain activity in a more natural setting.\n\n4.  **Medication Review and Optimization:**\n    *   \"Are there other anti-epileptic medications that might be more effective, or have fewer side effects?\"\n    *   \"Could the anti-depressant be contributing to the seizures?\"\n    *   \"Is there a specific reason why Tegretol was chosen over other AEDs? Have we considered newer generation AEDs with potentially better side effect profiles?\"\n    *   Consider genetic testing to guide medication selection. Certain genetic variations can affect how people respond to different AEDs.\n\n5.  **Surgical Evaluation (Consider if Medications are Ineffective):**\n    *   \"If we can identify a specific seizure focus, would my husband be a candidate for surgery to remove or disconnect that area?\" (Even with the prior hemispherectomy, a focal area could still be triggering events.)\n    *   **RNS (Responsive Neurostimulation):** RNS is a device implanted in the brain that detects abnormal electrical activity and delivers small electrical pulses to stop seizures before they start. It might be an option if a specific seizure focus is identified but can't be surgically removed.\n    *   **VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation):** While less targeted, VNS can sometimes help reduce seizure frequency in people who aren't candidates for more focused surgical interventions.\n    *   **DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation):** DBS involves implanting electrodes in specific areas of the brain to regulate brain activity. It's sometimes used for epilepsy when other treatments haven't been successful.\n\n6.  **Lifestyle Factors:**\n    *   **Sleep:** Discuss sleep hygiene with the neurologist. Poor sleep can trigger seizures.\n    *   **Stress:** Explore stress management techniques, as stress can also be a trigger.\n    *   **Diet:** Some people with epilepsy find that certain diets, like the ketogenic diet, can help reduce seizure frequency. Discuss this with the neurologist or a registered dietitian experienced in epilepsy management.\n\n7.  **Second Opinion:**\n    *   If you're not satisfied with the current neurologist's approach, consider getting a second opinion from an epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy), preferably at a comprehensive epilepsy center. These centers have more advanced diagnostic and treatment options.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy is complex:** It's important to remember that epilepsy management is often a process of trial and error. It may take time to find the right combination of medications and lifestyle changes to control the seizures.\n*   **Open Communication:** Maintain open and honest communication with the neurologist. Be prepared to provide detailed information about the seizures, including frequency, duration, triggers, and postictal symptoms.\n*   **Support:** Join a support group for people with epilepsy and their families. It can be helpful to connect with others who understand what you're going through. The Epilepsy Foundation is a good resource: [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns:**\n\n*   **\"Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better?\"** Yes, it's definitely worth exploring whether the seizures can be managed better. The fact that they are increasing in frequency suggests that the current treatment plan is not optimal.\n*   **\"Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?\"** While some level of seizure activity may be unavoidable, the goal is always to minimize seizure frequency and severity and improve quality of life. Don't accept the current situation as \"just the way it is\" without exploring all available options.\n\n**In summary,** I strongly encourage you to advocate for a more comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause of the increasing seizure frequency and explore all potential treatment options. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from an epileptologist at a comprehensive epilepsy center. You are an amazing advocate for your husband, and your persistence in seeking answers and better care is crucial.\n"

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds incredibly frustrating and painful. Constant muscle contractions and cramps, especially as frequent and widespread as you describe, definitely warrant a thorough investigation. Let's break down possible causes and things you can discuss with your doctor:\n\n**Potential Contributing Factors (Given Your History & Medications):**\n\n*   **Medication Side Effects:**\n    *   **Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine):** While less commonly associated with muscle cramps than some other stimulants, Vyvanse can indirectly contribute. It can lead to dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), anxiety (muscle tension), and decreased appetite (potential nutritional deficiencies).\n    *   **Keppra (Levetiracetam):** Muscle weakness is a listed side effect, but direct cramping is less common. However, it can indirectly influence things.\n    *   **Trintellix (Vortioxetine):** This antidepressant is less likely to directly cause muscle issues, but it can indirectly influence things through anxiety and changes in fluid/electrolyte balance.\n    *   **Ranitidine:** This medication decreases acid production in the stomach. I do not believe that it would be related to your muscle issues.\n    *   **Oral Contraceptives:** Some birth control pills can affect fluid balance and potentially contribute to muscle cramps in susceptible individuals.\n\n*   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** This is a big one.\n    *   **Magnesium:** Deficiency is a common culprit in muscle cramps. Vyvanse and some other medications can potentially deplete magnesium.\n    *   **Potassium:** Crucial for muscle function.\n    *   **Calcium:** Also essential, but deficiencies are less likely if you have a balanced diet (though medications can interfere with absorption).\n    *   **Sodium:** Dehydration and sodium imbalances can trigger cramps.\n\n*   **Dehydration:** You mentioned vaping, which can dehydrate you. Being adequately hydrated is vital for muscle function.\n\n*   **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n    *   **Vitamin D:** Important for muscle function and calcium absorption.\n    *   **B Vitamins:** Especially B12, which plays a role in nerve and muscle health.\n\n*   **Vascular Issues:** Although less likely given your age, poor circulation can sometimes cause muscle cramps, especially in the legs.\n\n*   **Neurological Issues:** Given your epilepsy, it's crucial to rule out any connection to your seizure activity or medication. While these contractions sound different from seizures, it's worth exploring.\n\n*   **Other Medical Conditions:**\n    *   **Hypothyroidism:** While you said you don't have other underlying conditions \"to your knowledge,\" hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness and cramps.\n    *   **Autoimmune Disorders:** In rare cases, certain autoimmune conditions can affect muscles.\n\n*   **Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS):** This is a benign condition that causes muscle twitching, cramping, and sometimes pain. It can be triggered by stress, anxiety, and caffeine.\n\n**What To Do & Discuss with Your Doctor:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Symptom Log:** Keep a record of when the cramps occur, where they occur, what you were doing (or not doing) at the time, their severity, and how long they last. This will be invaluable for your doctor.\n\n2.  **Medication Review:** Discuss *all* your medications with your doctor and pharmacist, including over-the-counter supplements. They need to assess potential interactions and side effects. *Do not stop any medication without your doctor's guidance.*\n\n3.  **Blood Tests:** Insist on a comprehensive blood panel that includes:\n    *   **Electrolytes:** Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride.\n    *   **Vitamin D, B12, Folate.**\n    *   **Thyroid Function (TSH, T4, T3).**\n    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for anemia or other abnormalities.**\n    *   **Kidney Function (BUN, Creatinine).**\n    *   **Creatine Kinase (CK):** This can indicate muscle damage, especially if the cramps are severe.\n    *   **Consider a Calcium-Albumin blood test to check for protein binding issues affecting your Calcium levels.*\n\n4.  **Neurological Evaluation:** Talk to your neurologist about the cramps. They may want to perform additional tests, such as an EMG (electromyography) to assess muscle and nerve function.\n\n5.  **Hydration & Diet:** Increase your water intake significantly. Consider adding electrolyte-rich drinks (like Gatorade or Pedialyte) *judiciously* after consulting your doctor, as excessive electrolytes can also be harmful. Review your diet with a registered dietitian.\n\n6.  **Magnesium Supplementation:** Discuss magnesium supplementation with your doctor. Different forms of magnesium have varying bioavailability (e.g., magnesium citrate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium oxide). *Don't start taking magnesium supplements without consulting a doctor, as they can interact with some medications and may not be appropriate for everyone.*\n\n7.  **Physical Therapy:** A physical therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises to help prevent cramps.\n\n8.  **Stress Management:** Explore stress-reduction techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n9.  **Consider Quitting Vaping:** While it might not be the sole cause, vaping can contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's easy to fall into the trap of searching online and diagnosing yourself. Your symptoms could be caused by a variety of factors, so it's crucial to get a professional evaluation.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** If you feel like your concerns are being dismissed, don't be afraid to seek a second opinion.\n*   **Be Patient:** Finding the cause of your cramps may take time and require multiple tests and doctor visits.\n\n**In summary, you need a thorough medical workup to identify the underlying cause of your constant muscle contractions. Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and get the necessary testing done. This is interfering with your quality of life, and you deserve answers and relief.**\n"

    "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about these episodes, especially given your history of epilepsy. The symptoms you're describing \u2013 the aura-like feeling, strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, overwhelming fear, panic attack symptoms, confusion, and the feeling of reliving a moment \u2013 can be associated with both anxiety disorders and certain types of seizures.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why it's difficult to say for sure what's happening without a proper medical evaluation, and what steps you should take:\n\n**Why it could be related to epilepsy (even though you're seizure-free):**\n\n*   **Focal Seizures:** Your symptoms are highly suggestive of focal seizures, particularly complex partial seizures (now called focal aware or focal impaired awareness seizures). These seizures often originate in the temporal lobe, which is responsible for memory, emotions, and sensory processing. This location can explain the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, and altered state of consciousness.\n*   **Aura:** The \"weird feeling\" before the episode could be an aura, which is a simple partial seizure (focal aware seizure) that acts as a warning sign for a more complex seizure.\n*   **Breakthrough Seizures:** Even if you've been seizure-free for two years, it's possible to experience breakthrough seizures, especially if there have been any changes in your medication, sleep patterns, stress levels, or other factors.\n*   **Sleep-Related Seizures:** The fact that you're experiencing these episodes during sleep is also consistent with certain types of epilepsy.\n\n**Why it could be related to anxiety/panic disorder:**\n\n*   **Panic Attacks:** Panic attacks can cause many of the physical symptoms you describe, such as heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, and a sense of impending doom.\n*   **Derealization/Depersonalization:** Anxiety can sometimes cause feelings of derealization (feeling detached from your surroundings) or depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself), which could be misinterpreted as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or a sense of reliving a moment.\n*   **Health Anxiety:** Worrying about having another seizure could trigger anxiety and panic attacks.\n*   **Hyperventilation:** The breathing problems you mentioned are indicative of hyperventilation, which can lead to some of the symptoms you are experiencing.\n\n**Why it's crucial to see a doctor, preferably a neurologist and/or an epileptologist:**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** It's impossible to diagnose the cause of your episodes without a thorough medical evaluation. A neurologist can perform tests, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) and MRI, to determine if there is any seizure activity or structural abnormalities in your brain.\n*   **Medication Adjustment:** If the episodes are related to epilepsy, your neurologist may need to adjust your Levetiracetam dosage or consider adding another medication. Even if the EEG is normal, your doctor might still consider a trial of increased medication if the clinical suspicion for seizures is high.\n*   **Ruling out Other Conditions:** Your doctor can also rule out other medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.\n*   **Treatment for Anxiety:** If anxiety is contributing to your episodes, your doctor can recommend therapy, medication, or lifestyle changes to manage your anxiety.\n*   **Safety:** Frequent episodes where you have altered awareness can be dangerous. Driving or operating machinery during these times is particularly risky.\n\n**What you should do immediately:**\n\n1.  **Schedule an Appointment:** Make an appointment with your neurologist or epileptologist as soon as possible. Explain the frequency, duration, and specific symptoms of your episodes. If you don't have a neurologist, get a referral from your primary care physician.\n2.  **Keep a Seizure/Symptom Diary:** Start documenting each episode. Include the date, time, duration, specific symptoms, any triggers you can identify, and what you were doing before the episode. This information will be helpful for your doctor.\n3.  **Don't Change Medication:** Do not change your Levetiracetam dosage or stop taking it without consulting your doctor.\n4.  **Avoid Potential Triggers:** Try to identify and avoid any potential triggers for your episodes, such as stress, sleep deprivation, or caffeine.\n5.  **Consider a Video EEG:** Your doctor may recommend a video EEG, which records your brain activity while you are being video monitored. This can help capture any seizure activity that might not be detected on a routine EEG.\n6.  **Discuss your concerns:** Talk to your neurologist about your concerns and ask them if your medication still effective, since it's been two years since your last seizure.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Triggers:** Try to identify potential triggers such as stress, lack of sleep, changes in diet, and hormonal changes.\n*   **Lifestyle modifications:** Getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and managing stress can help prevent seizures and anxiety.\n*   **Therapy:** If anxiety is an issue, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be very effective in managing panic attacks and other anxiety symptoms.\n*   **Support groups:** Joining a support group for people with epilepsy or anxiety can provide valuable emotional support and practical advice.\n\n**In summary, it's important to take these episodes seriously and seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause. Your symptoms could be related to epilepsy, anxiety, or a combination of both. A proper diagnosis is essential for developing an effective treatment plan.**\n\n*This information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex and concerning set of symptoms. It's important to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a diagnosis or treatment plan. You need to see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why these symptoms are concerning and what a doctor will likely investigate:\n\n*   **Dizziness and Lightheadedness Correlated with Exhalation:** This is unusual. Typically, dizziness is associated with inhalation (related to blood pressure changes). The fact that it worsens on exhalation suggests potential issues with:\n    *   **Respiratory Function:** While you describe normal breathing, the sensation of \"brain not being nourished\" on exhalation could indicate an issue with gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Anemia can contribute to this.\n    *   **Circulatory Issues:**  Problems with blood pressure regulation or blood flow to the brain could be exacerbated by the changes in intrathoracic pressure during exhalation.\n    *   **Neurological Problems:** Something affecting how the brain interprets these respiratory and circulatory changes.\n\n*   **Sensations in the Brain:** The descriptions of \"brain feeling full,\" \"brain vibrating,\" \"electrical feeling,\" and \"something rushing into the brain\" are all concerning. These suggest a potential neurological issue.\n\n*   **\"Jerks\" upon Waking:** These sound like myoclonic jerks, which are sudden, involuntary muscle twitches or jerks. While sometimes benign, frequent or forceful myoclonic jerks, especially when accompanied by other neurological symptoms, need investigation.  The inability to speak during these events is also worrisome.\n\n*   **Anemia:** Anemia, even when treated, can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. However, it doesn't usually explain the specific brain sensations you're describing. It's important to determine the *cause* of your anemia.\n\n**Possible Considerations for a Doctor:**\n\nBased on your description, a doctor will likely consider the following:\n\n1.  **Full Physical and Neurological Examination:** This is essential to assess your overall health and neurological function.\n2.  **Blood Tests:**\n    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check your red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit to assess the severity of your anemia and evaluate other blood cell lines\n    *   **Iron Studies:** Ferritin, serum iron, TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity) to assess iron levels and iron storage.\n    *   **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:** Deficiencies can cause anemia and neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Electrolytes:** Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium \u2013 imbalances can cause neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Thyroid Function Tests (TSH, T4):** Thyroid disorders can sometimes cause neurological symptoms.\n3.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** To assess heart function, as heart problems can sometimes cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\n4.  **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** To check for orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing).\n5.  **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):** To rule out sleep disorders, especially if the \"jerks\" are happening during sleep.\n6.  **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** To evaluate brain activity and rule out seizure activity, even if you don't have a history of epilepsy.\n7.  **Imaging:**\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** This is likely necessary to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n\n**What you need to do immediately:**\n\n1.  **Schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.**  Explain the urgency of your symptoms.\n2.  **Be prepared to provide a detailed medical history.** Include all medications, supplements, and any previous medical conditions.\n3.  **Keep a detailed log of your symptoms.** Note the frequency, duration, and any triggers that seem to worsen or improve them.\n4.  **Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery** if you are experiencing dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\n**In summary, your symptoms require immediate medical attention. Do not delay seeking professional medical help.**\n"

    "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're trying to understand what's happening and that you've done some research to try and make sense of your experiences. It's good that you're proactive in your health journey.\n\nBased on what you've shared, here's a breakdown of what makes sense and what needs to be considered:\n\n**What Makes Sense (and aligns with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy):**\n\n*   **Grand Mal Seizures with Warning:** The description of feeling nauseous right before the seizure, followed by loss of consciousness and a deja vu feeling, is consistent with a seizure originating in the temporal lobe that then generalizes into a grand mal seizure. The initial warning is often referred to as an \"aura,\" and it's a focal seizure experienced before the generalized seizure.\n*   **Deja Vu:** This is a *very* common symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy. The feeling of \"knowing\" what's about to happen is a classic presentation.\n*   **Childhood \"Episodes\":** The described episodes as a child where sounds seem agressive and urgent could be a non convulsive focal seizure.\n*   **EEG Findings:** Abnormal activity on the left side of the brain during a sleep-deprived EEG is a significant finding and supports the possibility of a focal epilepsy originating from the left temporal lobe. Sleep deprivation is known to provoke seizures in susceptible individuals, making the sleep-deprived EEG a more sensitive test.\n*   **Emotional Outbursts in Childhood:** Unexplained refusal to go to places, especially if combined with other symptoms, *could* be related to temporal lobe seizures, although it's harder to say definitively. These could also be related to normal childhood development.\n\n**Points to Consider (and Discuss with your Neurologist):**\n\n*   **Tonsillectomy and Mononucleosis:** While the tonsillectomy itself isn't directly linked to epilepsy, the mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) is something to mention. While rare, some viral infections can, in theory, trigger or worsen seizures. There is no direct link that the seizure were triggered due to the infection but the more information you provide your neurologist, the easier it is to make a diagnose.\n*   **Normal MRI:** A normal MRI doesn't rule out temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy can be caused by subtle abnormalities that are not visible on standard MRI. In some cases, specialized MRI protocols (like high-resolution MRI) may be needed to identify subtle changes. In addition, some people simply have genetic predispositions.\n\n**What To Do Next:**\n\n1.  **Document Everything:** Continue to meticulously document any unusual sensations, feelings, or behaviors, including:\n    *   Exact descriptions of your \"auras\" before seizures (what do you feel, smell, hear, see, think?)\n    *   Details of deja vu experiences (when do they occur, what triggers them?)\n    *   Frequency and nature of any other unusual sensations.\n\n2.  **Discuss Your Concerns with Your New Neurologist:**\n    *   **Be Clear:** State that you've researched temporal lobe epilepsy and feel that your symptoms align with it.\n    *   **Present Your Documentation:** Provide your documented notes of your experiences. This is incredibly helpful to your neurologist.\n    *   **Ask Questions:** Don't be afraid to ask direct questions about the possibility of temporal lobe epilepsy, further diagnostic testing, and potential treatment options.\n\n3.  **Consider Further Testing:** Discuss with your neurologist if the following tests may be necessary:\n    *   **Long-Term EEG Monitoring:** This can capture seizure activity over a longer period (days or weeks) and can be more likely to detect abnormalities, especially if your seizures are infrequent. Sometimes, this is done with video EEG monitoring, so the doctors can review your behaviours during the seizure.\n    *   **High-Resolution MRI:** Ask if a specialized MRI protocol specifically for detecting subtle temporal lobe abnormalities (like hippocampal sclerosis) would be beneficial.\n    *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** This type of testing can evaluate cognitive functions that are often affected in temporal lobe epilepsy, such as memory and language.\n\n4.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't be afraid to seek a second opinion if you feel your concerns aren't being adequately addressed. It's important to find a neurologist who you trust and who is willing to listen to your concerns.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Self-Diagnosis is Not a Substitute for Professional Medical Advice:** While your research is helpful, it's crucial to have a qualified neurologist make the diagnosis. Many conditions can mimic epilepsy.\n*   **Treatment Options:** If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, there are many effective treatment options available, including anti-seizure medications, surgery, and other therapies.\n\nIt sounds like you are on the right track by seeking medical attention and doing your own research. Keep advocating for yourself, and work closely with your neurologist to get the correct diagnosis and treatment.\n"

    "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your concern. Elevated eosinophils without a clear parasitic infection can be puzzling, but it's good you're seeing a hematologist. Here's a breakdown of what could be going on, keeping in mind I am not a doctor and this is just general information:\n\n**Understanding Eosinophils**\n\nEosinophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in:\n\n*   **Fighting Parasitic Infections:** This is their primary role. They release toxic substances to kill parasites.\n*   **Allergic Reactions:** They are activated by allergens and contribute to inflammation.\n*   **Inflammatory Conditions:** They can be involved in a variety of inflammatory processes.\n\n**Possible Causes of Elevated Eosinophils (Eosinophilia) - Aside from Parasites**\n\nGiven that you haven't traveled abroad and deny having any allergies (although the possibility should still be explored further), here's a list of potential causes that your hematologist will likely investigate. Keep in mind this is not an exhaustive list and diagnosis requires careful evaluation:\n\n*   **Allergic Reactions:**\n    *   **Drug Reactions:** This is *very* important to consider given your current medication regimen. **Topamax, Rivotril, and Venlafaxine can all potentially cause eosinophilia.** Your hematologist will want to carefully consider this. Even if you've been on the medications for a while, a delayed reaction is possible.\n    *   **Food Allergies/Sensitivities:** Sometimes these are subtle and not immediately obvious. An elimination diet or allergy testing might be considered.\n    *   **Environmental Allergens:** While you say you have no allergies, sometimes allergies develop later in life, or you might not be aware of a mild sensitivity.\n*   **Skin Conditions:**\n    *   **Eczema/Atopic Dermatitis:** Even if it's mild or intermittent, it can sometimes elevate eosinophils.\n    *   **Psoriasis**\n*   **Asthma:** Even if you haven't been diagnosed with asthma, your eosinophils could be elevated for it, especially if you have a dry cough or other symptoms of asthma.\n*   **Other Inflammatory Conditions:**\n    *   **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE):** Inflammation of the esophagus. Often associated with food allergies.\n    *   **Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis:** Similar to EoE, but affecting the stomach and intestines.\n    *   **Vasculitis:** Inflammation of blood vessels.\n    *   **Connective Tissue Diseases:** Like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.\n*   **Hematologic (Blood) Disorders:**\n    *   **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES):** This is a rare group of disorders where eosinophils are chronically elevated, causing damage to organs over time. This diagnosis requires a more complex work-up\n    *   **Leukemia/Lymphoma:** In rare cases, eosinophilia can be associated with certain blood cancers. This is less likely if you have no other concerning symptoms, but it needs to be ruled out.\n*   **Infections (Other than Parasites):**\n    *   **Fungal Infections:** Certain fungal infections can sometimes trigger eosinophilia.\n    *   **HIV:** In some cases.\n*   **Endocrine Disorders:**\n    *   **Addison's Disease:** Though rare, adrenal insufficiency can sometimes be associated with eosinophilia.\n*   **Tumors:** In very rare cases, solid tumors can produce substances that stimulate eosinophil production.\n\n**What the Hematologist Will Likely Do**\n\nThe hematologist will likely take a detailed history, including:\n\n*   **Medication Review:** A thorough review of your current medications (dosages, duration) and any recent changes.\n*   **Allergy History:** A more detailed exploration of potential allergies, including exposures to new products, foods, or environments.\n*   **Symptom Assessment:** Even though you don't have many specific complaints, they'll ask about things like fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes, digestive issues, respiratory symptoms, etc.\n*   **Physical Exam:** Looking for any signs of skin conditions, enlarged lymph nodes, or other abnormalities.\n\nThey will also likely order further testing:\n\n*   **Repeat Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential:** To confirm the eosinophilia.\n*   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** To assess liver and kidney function.\n*   **Stool Ova and Parasite Exam (O&P):** Even though your neurologist ruled out a parasite, it's possible that they're hiding in your digestive tract.\n*   **IgE Levels:** To assess for allergic reactions.\n*   **Specific Allergy Testing:** Skin prick tests or blood tests (RAST) for common allergens.\n*   **Thyroid Function Tests:** To rule out thyroid abnormalities\n*   **Consider stopping your medication and evaluating the evolution of the eosinophil level**\n*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** This is usually only done if other causes are ruled out and the eosinophilia is persistent or severe.\n\n**What You Can Do Now**\n\n*   **Keep a detailed symptom diary:** Note any new or worsening symptoms, even if they seem minor. Track your medications and dosages.\n*   **Write down any questions you have for the hematologist.**\n*   **Be prepared to provide a thorough medical history.**\n*   **Consider if your symptoms are possibly side effects from your epilepsy meds.**\n*   **Relax:** While it's understandable to be worried, try not to jump to conclusions. Most cases of eosinophilia are benign or treatable. The hematologist will help you figure out what's going on.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Your Current Medications**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the possibility of drug-induced eosinophilia from Topamax, Rivotril, or Venlafaxine is a real concern. Here's why:\n\n*   **Topamax (Topiramate):** While less common, topiramate has been linked to eosinophilia in some cases.\n*   **Rivotril (Clonazepam):** Less commonly associated, but any medication can potentially cause an allergic reaction.\n*   **Venlafaxine (Effexor):** Has also been reported as a potential cause of eosinophilia in rare cases.\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Hematologist About Your Medications**\n\n*   **The timeline:** When did the elevated eosinophils first appear in relation to when you started or changed any of your medications?\n*   **Alternative medications:** Are there alternative medications for your epilepsy or depression that are less likely to cause eosinophilia? (This would need to be discussed with your neurologist and psychiatrist, respectively.)\n*   **Trial discontinuation (under medical supervision):** Would it be safe and appropriate to try temporarily discontinuing one of your medications (under strict medical supervision) to see if the eosinophil levels decrease? **Do NOT do this on your own.** Discontinuing epilepsy medication abruptly can be dangerous.\n*   **Ruling out other causes:** Make sure the hematologist thoroughly investigates other potential causes before attributing the eosinophilia to your medications.\n\nIn summary, your hematologist will work to identify the underlying cause of your elevated eosinophils and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Be open and honest with them, and don't hesitate to ask questions. I hope this information is helpful!\n"

    "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",

    "answer": "It's understandable that you're curious about these \"flashes\" and want to understand what's happening. While I am not a medical professional and cannot provide a diagnosis, I can offer some information and perspectives that might be helpful to discuss with your doctor or another healthcare provider.\n\nHere's a breakdown of possibilities and what you might want to consider:\n\n**Why it *might* be related to epilepsy (though unlikely based on your description):**\n\n*   **Sensory Sensitivity:** Epilepsy can sometimes manifest as sensory sensitivity. The sudden \"bang\" of ringing in your ears and the feeling of being \"out of it\" could, in some rare cases, be related to a brief seizure activity affecting sensory processing areas of the brain.\n\n*   **Triggers:** The consistency of the trigger (thinking about the past, seeing old objects) could point to a specific area of the brain being activated in a way that occasionally leads to a brief disruption. Some people with epilepsy have very specific and unusual triggers.\n\n**Why it *might not* be related to epilepsy (and likely a more plausible explanation):**\n\n*   **Lack of typical seizure features:** You don't describe any of the more classic seizure symptoms like convulsions, loss of consciousness, uncontrollable muscle movements, or a post-ictal (after-seizure) state of confusion.\n\n*   **Specificity of trigger:** While triggers exist for epilepsy, the highly specific nature of the \"past immersion\" trigger is less common than more general triggers like flashing lights, sleep deprivation, or stress.\n\n*   **Brief duration:** The very short duration of the episodes (around a second) makes it less likely to be a typical epileptic seizure.\n\n**Other possibilities to consider:**\n\n*   **Migraine Aura:** Migraines can sometimes present with auras that include sensory disturbances like ringing in the ears, dizziness, and a feeling of being \"out of it.\"  Some auras can be very brief and not followed by a headache.  The fact that you almost lost your balance points in this direction as well.\n\n*   **Vestibular Issues:** Problems with the inner ear (the vestibular system) can cause dizziness, balance problems, and a feeling of disorientation. Sometimes these issues can be triggered by sensory overload or specific mental states.\n\n*   **Anxiety/Panic:** While you don't describe feeling anxious or panicky, sometimes anxiety can manifest in unexpected ways. The \"flash\" could be a form of brief dissociation triggered by the intensity of the memory recall.\n\n*   **Vasovagal Response:** A vasovagal response (fainting response) can be triggered by various factors, including emotional stress or sudden changes in blood pressure. While usually causing lightheadedness or fainting, a very mild version could potentially cause the brief symptoms you describe.\n\n*   **Tinnitus:** While you describe the ear ringing as part of a larger \"flash,\" it's possible you're experiencing brief episodes of tinnitus.  Sometimes tinnitus can be more noticeable when you're in a quiet environment or concentrating.\n\n*   **Memory-Related Phenomenon:**  It's possible that your brain is processing memories in a unique way that triggers a brief, non-pathological sensory experience. This could be related to how your brain integrates sensory information with autobiographical memories.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1.  **Be More Detailed with Your Doctor:**  While your doctor may have dismissed it because it's \"not a real impairment,\" providing more detail about the specific triggers, the exact sensations you experience, and the duration of the episodes might encourage them to investigate further. Explain how it impacts your overall sense of well-being, even if it's brief.\n\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Log:** For the next few weeks/months, carefully log each episode. Note:\n    *   **Date and time**\n    *   **Specific trigger:** Be as detailed as possible about what you were thinking about or looking at.\n    *   **Sensations:** Describe the ringing, dizziness, \"out-of-it\" feeling, etc., as precisely as you can.\n    *   **Duration:** How long does each sensation last?\n    *   **Any other associated symptoms:** Headache, nausea, anxiety, etc.\n    *   **Any recent stressors or changes in your life.**\n\n3.  **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you're still concerned and your doctor isn't taking it seriously, consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist. A neurologist specializes in brain and nervous system disorders and might be better equipped to evaluate your symptoms.\n\n4.  **Explore Possible Migraine Link:** If the \"flash\" sensations are brief and not associated with the more commonly known migraines, it might be worth consulting with a neurologist regarding the possibility of an atypical migraine that is triggering a brief aura.\n\n5.  **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's easy to fall down the rabbit hole of internet searching and self-diagnosing. Remember that online information is no substitute for a professional medical evaluation.\n\nThe key is to advocate for yourself and provide your doctor with as much information as possible. The more data you can provide, the better equipped they will be to determine the cause of these \"flashes\" and recommend appropriate treatment or management strategies. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a very important question that requires careful consideration and professional medical advice. **Given your history of epilepsy, even though it was triggered by a head injury and you haven't had seizures in over 20 years, you absolutely should consult with a neurologist before undergoing any test involving a stun gun.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why and what you should do:\n\n*   **Potential Risk:** While you haven't had seizures in a long time, the electrical discharge from a stun gun could potentially trigger a seizure, even after such a long period of remission. The brain is complex, and previous injury can sometimes leave it more vulnerable.\n\n*   **Neurological Evaluation is Key:** A neurologist can assess your current neurological health, review your medical history (including the cause and duration of your epilepsy), and perform any necessary tests (like an EEG) to evaluate your current risk. They can advise you on the potential risks and benefits of proceeding with the stun gun test.\n\n*   **Informed Decision:** Based on the neurologist's evaluation, you can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the test. You'll understand the potential risks involved and can weigh them against the importance of the job.\n\n*   **Alternative Career Paths/Accommodations:** Discuss with the potential employer if there are alternative tests that could be performed for you. If the test is essential for the job, consider whether this is truly the right career path for you, given your medical history. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being.\n\n*   **Disclosure:** You have a right to choose when and how you disclose your medical history to a prospective employer, and you need to be aware of your regional legal requirements. However, in this specific circumstance, informing them about your medical history *prior* to taking such a test may prevent adverse health consequences.\n\n*   **Don't rely on anecdotal evidence:** Every individual reacts differently to seizures or electrical stimulation. It is best to consult a professional.\n\n**In summary, seeking professional medical advice from a neurologist is the most crucial step you can take. Do not proceed with the stun gun test without it.** They can provide personalized guidance based on your specific medical history and help you make a safe and informed decision.\n"

    "question": "I am a 23 year old women I was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease and other chronic inflammation about 8 years ago, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy, on top of that I have cysts throughout my body. I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's great that you're being proactive in understanding your conditions. Let's break down the connections between inflammation, epilepsy, and cysts, keeping in mind that I am an AI and this information is for educational purposes and should not replace advice from your medical professionals.\n\n**1. Inflammation and Epilepsy**\n\nYou're right to explore the connection between inflammation and epilepsy.  There's growing evidence that inflammation, both within the brain (neuroinflammation) and systemically (throughout the body), can play a significant role in the development, severity, and progression of epilepsy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the potential links:\n\n*   **Neuroinflammation and Seizure Generation:**\n    *   **Inflammatory Mediators:** Inflammatory molecules like cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), chemokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be elevated in the brains of people with epilepsy. These molecules can disrupt neuronal function, making neurons more excitable and prone to seizures.\n    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption:** Inflammation can damage the BBB, which normally protects the brain from harmful substances.  A leaky BBB allows inflammatory cells and molecules to enter the brain, further fueling inflammation and potentially triggering seizures.\n    *   **Glial Cell Activation:**  Glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) are the brain's immune cells. In epilepsy, they can become over-activated (neuroinflammation). This can lead to the release of more inflammatory mediators and contribute to neuronal damage.\n    *   **Synaptic Plasticity:** Inflammation can disrupt synaptic plasticity, the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken connections between neurons. This disruption can lead to abnormal neuronal circuits that are more prone to seizures.\n\n*   **Systemic Inflammation and Epilepsy:**\n    *   **Cytokine Access:** Systemic inflammation (like that from Crohn's disease) can lead to increased levels of cytokines in the bloodstream. These cytokines can potentially cross the BBB (especially if it's already compromised) and influence brain excitability.\n    *   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation:** Systemic inflammation can activate the vagus nerve, which connects the gut to the brain. This activation can influence brain activity and potentially affect seizure threshold.\n    *   **Gut Microbiome:** There's increasing research into the gut-brain axis. Chronic inflammation in the gut (like in Crohn's) can alter the gut microbiome composition. These changes can produce metabolites that influence brain function and potentially affect seizure susceptibility.\n\n*   **Specific Inflammatory Conditions and Epilepsy:**\n    *   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**  This is a specific condition where the immune system attacks the brain, causing inflammation and often seizures. It's something your doctors would likely consider if your epilepsy is difficult to control or presents with unusual symptoms.\n    *   **Other Autoimmune Diseases:** Some studies suggest a possible increased risk of epilepsy in individuals with certain autoimmune diseases, though the exact relationship is still being researched.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n\n*   **Discuss this with your neurologist:**  It's crucial to discuss the potential role of inflammation in your epilepsy with your neurologist.  They can order appropriate tests (like EEG, MRI) and assess your specific case.\n*   **Crohn's Disease Management:** Effectively managing your Crohn's disease is essential.  Reducing inflammation in your gut may have a beneficial effect on your epilepsy, although further research is needed.\n\n**2. Cysts and Inflammation**\n\nThe connection between cysts and inflammation is more variable, depending on the type of cyst. Some cysts are directly caused by or associated with inflammation, while others are not.\n\n*   **Cysts directly related to Inflammation:**\n    *   **Epidermoid cysts/Sebaceous Cysts**: These can be caused by inflammation of a hair follicle, leading to the build-up of keratin under the skin\n    *   **Pilonidal Cysts:** These often form at the base of the spine and are frequently associated with inflammation and infection due to ingrown hairs.\n    *   **Bartholin's Cysts:** Blockage of the Bartholin's glands (near the vaginal opening) can lead to cyst formation, often accompanied by inflammation and sometimes infection.\n\n*   **Cysts that are associated with but not directly caused by Inflammation:**\n    *   **Ovarian Cysts:** While most ovarian cysts aren't inflammatory in nature, some types, like those associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can be linked to chronic inflammation and hormonal imbalances.\n    *   **Breast Cysts:** Most breast cysts are not directly related to inflammation. However, fibrocystic changes in the breast (which can involve cysts) can sometimes be associated with discomfort and mild inflammation.\n\n*   **Cysts generally not related to Inflammation:**\n    *   **Ganglion Cysts:** These typically form near joints or tendons and are filled with synovial fluid. They are generally not associated with inflammation unless they cause nerve compression or other irritation.\n    *   **Kidney Cysts:** Simple kidney cysts are common and usually asymptomatic. They are generally not related to inflammation.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n\n*   **Identify the types of cysts you have:** It's essential to know what types of cysts you have throughout your body. Where are they located? What have doctors told you about their nature?\n*   **Discuss with your doctor:** Talk to your doctor about whether the cysts are related to your chronic inflammation. If some of them are, managing your overall inflammation may help.\n\n**Important Considerations for Both Epilepsy and Cysts**\n\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Be sure your doctors are aware of all medications you are taking for both Crohn's disease and epilepsy. Some medications can interact with each other, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing side effects.\n*   **Lifestyle Factors:**  Stress, sleep deprivation, and poor diet can all exacerbate both inflammation and seizures.  Focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a balanced diet.\n\n**In summary:** There are clear potential connections between inflammation and epilepsy, which warrant further investigation and discussion with your neurologist. The relationship between cysts and inflammation is more variable, depending on the type of cyst. Providing your doctors with as much information as possible about your symptoms, cyst locations, and medical history will help them determine the best course of treatment for you.\n\n**Actionable Steps**\n\n1.  **Schedule an appointment with your neurologist:** Discuss your concerns about inflammation and epilepsy.\n2.  **Keep a detailed seizure diary:** Note the date, time, duration, and any potential triggers or symptoms before and after your seizures. This information will be valuable for your neurologist.\n3.  **Keep a symptom diary:** This will allow you to track the patterns and correlations between your symptoms and flares.\n4.  **Discuss your cysts with your doctor:** Clarify the types of cysts you have and whether they could be related to inflammation.\n\nRemember to be patient and work closely with your healthcare team. They are the best resource for developing a personalized treatment plan to manage your conditions.\n"

    "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. I understand your concerns about the new medication, especially given your history and communication challenges. Let's analyze SELENICA-R 40% in the context of your symptoms and the information you've provided.\n\n**Understanding SELENICA-R 40% (Sodium Valproate)**\n\nSELENICA-R 40% likely contains sodium valproate as the active ingredient. Sodium valproate is primarily an anticonvulsant, meaning it's used to treat:\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** This is its main indication.\n*   **Bipolar Disorder:** It can be used as a mood stabilizer.\n*   **Migraine Prophylaxis:** Sometimes used to prevent migraines.\n\n**Why Might a Doctor Prescribe Sodium Valproate for You?**\n\nGiven your symptoms, here are some *potential* reasons, although it's crucial to confirm the doctor's reasoning directly:\n\n1.  **Migraine-Associated Vertigo:** While you didn't specifically mention migraines, the dizziness and some of your other symptoms *could* potentially point towards migraine-associated vertigo (vestibular migraine). Sodium valproate can be used as a preventative treatment for migraines.\n\n2.  **Undiagnosed Seizure Disorder:** Even if you haven't had obvious seizures, some seizure disorders can present with subtle symptoms like dizziness, motor function issues, and cognitive changes. Your doctor might be considering this possibility, even if other tests haven't definitively confirmed it.\n\n3.  **Off-Label Use:** Sometimes, medications are used \"off-label,\" meaning they are prescribed for conditions other than those they are officially approved for. In this case, the doctor may believe sodium valproate has a chance of working.\n\n**Important Considerations and Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Doctor's Reasoning:** *This is the most important thing.* You **MUST** directly ask your doctor *why* they are prescribing this medication for you. Do not start taking it until you have a clear understanding of their rationale. Ask them to explain it in simple terms. \"I don't understand why this is being prescribed given my symptoms. Can you explain your reasoning for this choice of medication?\"\n*   **Diagnostic Process:** Ask your doctor if they suspect a particular condition (like a subtle seizure disorder, migraine-associated vertigo, etc.) and if they plan any further testing to confirm or rule it out.\n*   **Expected Benefits:** What specific symptoms are they hoping to improve with this medication? How long should you take it before you expect to see results?\n*   **Side Effects:** Sodium valproate has potential side effects.  Discuss them with your doctor. Common side effects can include nausea, tremor, weight gain, hair loss, and drowsiness.  More serious side effects can occur.\n*   **Drug Interactions:** Make sure your doctor is aware of all other medications and supplements you are taking, including the high-dose magnesium.\n*   **Monitoring:** Will you need regular blood tests while taking this medication to monitor liver function or valproate levels?\n*   **Tapering:** It is important to understand that you need to talk to your doctor about tapering (slowly decreasing your dose of medication) before completely stopping.\n\n**Things to Consider About Your Symptoms**\n\n*   **Zoloft and Lexapro:** You may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms from Lexapro. Although you have been off of it for awhile, it is important to keep that as a possibility.\n*   **Pinched Nerve/Bulged Disc:** Seeing a specialist for this is a good idea, especially given the motor function issues, joint pain, and possible link to dizziness if it's affecting the cervical spine.\n*   **Magnesium Overdose?** I am not a medical professional, so I cannot tell you that you're ingesting too much, however, 2000mg/day of Magnesium is quite high! Side effects of Magnesium overdose is diarrhea and dehydration. You could have an electrolyte imbalance. If the diarrhea has been chronic, it's very important to see a doctor.\n*   **Speech Issues, Dizziness and Motor Function:** Since your doctor is trying Sodium Valproate, it does seem like he thinks it's neurological, but it's important to directly ask him.\n*   **Anxiety:** Dizziness can cause significant anxiety, which in turn can exacerbate the dizziness, creating a vicious cycle. It's important to address the anxiety component, regardless of the underlying cause.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\n1.  **Schedule a detailed follow-up appointment with your doctor.**  Go prepared with a list of questions (use the ones above as a starting point). Write down the answers and take notes.\n2.  **Don't start the SELENICA-R 40% until you have a clear understanding of the doctor's reasoning and you are comfortable with the potential risks and benefits.**\n3.  **Consider a second opinion from another neurologist or a dizziness specialist (vestibular specialist) if you are still unsure or concerned.**\n4.  **Continue pursuing investigations into potential pinched nerves or other musculoskeletal issues.**\n5.  **If your doctor isn't doing this, suggest he looks into Magnesium toxicity/overdose with blood tests.**\n\n**Crucially:** Your health is your priority. You have the right to understand your treatment plan and to seek second opinions. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself, even if there are communication barriers. Use online translation tools if needed, or ask a trusted friend or family member to assist you.\n"

    "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds. Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your questions about epilepsy and address your concerns. It's good you're being proactive about your health, especially considering family history. However, remember that online information is for general knowledge and should never replace advice from a qualified medical professional.\n\n**What is Epilepsy?**\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior, movement, or consciousness. The key word here is \"unprovoked.\" A single seizure doesn't necessarily mean someone has epilepsy. It becomes epilepsy when the seizures happen repeatedly without a clear, identifiable trigger.\n\n**Can Epilepsy Happen for \"No Reason\"? (Idiopathic Epilepsy)**\n\nYes, it absolutely can. In many cases, the exact cause of epilepsy is unknown. This is called *idiopathic epilepsy* or sometimes *genetic epilepsy*. In these cases, it's believed that there's an underlying genetic predisposition that makes the brain more susceptible to seizures. It doesn't always mean a specific, identified gene is the culprit. It could be a combination of subtle genetic variations.  Think of it like this: your brain's electrical system is wired in a slightly different way that makes it more prone to short-circuiting.\n\n**Family History & Risk**\n\n*   **Your Mom's Cousin:**  The fact that your mom's cousin had epilepsy and died as a result (complications, or SUDEP, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) *does* mean you might be at a *slightly* increased risk compared to someone with no family history.  However, the increased risk is generally still relatively low. Epilepsy is complex. Many different genes can contribute, and the way genes are inherited can be unpredictable. The closer the relative, the higher the risk.\n\n*   **Your Cousin's Children:** They are at a potentially higher risk than you because they are first-degree relatives (direct descendants) of someone with epilepsy.  The exact risk level depends on the type of epilepsy your cousin had. Some epilepsy syndromes have a much stronger genetic component than others. They should discuss their concerns with a doctor.\n\n*   **What to Do:**  Talk to your doctor about your family history.  They can assess your risk and may recommend specific monitoring or precautions (which are unlikely, but worth discussing).  Do *not* self-diagnose or become overly anxious.\n\n**Can Drugs/Medications Cause Epilepsy?**\n\n*   **Smoking/Alcohol:**  Chronic, heavy alcohol use and smoking are associated with increased risk of seizures, but typically through causing secondary brain damage from associated alcohol withdrawal, head trauma from falls, and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke. It is unlikely for these activities to directly cause epilepsy but may unmask an underlying genetic predisposition.\n\n*   **Antidepressants (like Citalopram/Celexa):**  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram *can* lower the seizure threshold in some people, meaning they make seizures slightly more likely. The risk is generally low, especially at typical doses. It's more of a concern if you have a pre-existing seizure disorder or other risk factors. If you're already taking citalopram and are concerned, do *not* stop it abruptly. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and they can evaluate the risk-benefit profile for you specifically. It's a discussion to have, not a reason to panic. Other medications, including stimulants, antipsychotics, and some pain medications, can also lower the seizure threshold.\n\n**Factors That Can *Provoke* Seizures (Even in People Without Epilepsy)**\n\nThese are things that can trigger a seizure in someone who is already predisposed or, in rare cases, even someone without a known predisposition:\n\n*   **Sleep Deprivation:** This is a big one.\n*   **Stress:** Significant stress can be a trigger.\n*   **Fever/Illness:** High fevers, especially in children, can trigger seizures.\n*   **Alcohol Withdrawal:** Extremely dangerous and can cause seizures.\n*   **Drug Use/Withdrawal:** Certain drugs, both recreational and prescription, can increase seizure risk.\n*   **Head Trauma:** A significant head injury can lead to epilepsy later in life.\n*   **Stroke or Other Brain Injury:** Damage to the brain can disrupt electrical activity.\n*   **Photosensitivity:**  Rare, but some people are sensitive to flashing lights.\n*   **Hormonal Changes:** Menstrual cycles and other hormonal fluctuations can affect seizure frequency in some women with epilepsy.\n\n**Regarding Your HRT**\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) can affect the central nervous system, but whether it *causes* epilepsy is unlikely. However, like any medication, there can be interactions and effects that are specific to the individual. It is really important to discuss your HRT with your healthcare provider in the context of your family history and your concerns about epilepsy. They can assess any potential risks and advise accordingly.\n\n**Important Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Doctor:** Seriously, this is the most important step. Bring up your family history of epilepsy and your concerns. They can assess your individual risk and provide personalized advice.\n2.  **Don't Self-Diagnose or Over-Research:** The internet can be a rabbit hole of misinformation. Trust your doctor to interpret your situation accurately.\n3.  **Live a Healthy Lifestyle:** Good sleep, stress management, a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive alcohol and smoking are good for overall health and may help reduce your (already probably low) risk.\n\nIn short, your mom's cousin having epilepsy does not mean you *will* develop it. It slightly increases your risk, but it's still likely to be low. Medications can, in some cases, lower the seizure threshold, but that doesn't automatically mean you'll have a seizure. The best thing you can do is have an open and honest conversation with your doctor. They can provide you with the most accurate and relevant information.\n"

    "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break this down. It's understandable that you're concerned after experiencing those feelings with flashing lights and then intentionally watching a potentially triggering video.\n\n**Here's a realistic assessment of your situation:**\n\n*   **Photosensitive Epilepsy is a Real Thing:** It's true that some people have seizures triggered by flashing lights, patterns, or certain visual stimuli. This is called photosensitive epilepsy. However, it's a relatively small percentage of people with epilepsy overall.\n\n*   **Feeling \"Off\" Doesn't Automatically Mean Epilepsy:** Many people without epilepsy find flashing lights uncomfortable or even disorienting. It can cause:\n    *   Eyestrain\n    *   Headache\n    *   Nausea\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Anxiety or a feeling of unease. This matches your \"impending doom\" feeling.\n\n*   **The \"Test\" Video Was a Bad Idea:**  *Never* intentionally expose yourself to potentially triggering stimuli if you suspect you might have photosensitive epilepsy. That was a risky move.\n\n*   **One-Time Exposure Doesn't Usually Cause Epilepsy:** Watching that video isn't likely to have *caused* you to develop epilepsy if you didn't have it before. Epilepsy is generally caused by underlying brain conditions, not by a single exposure to flashing lights. However, repeated exposure could theoretically make you more sensitive.\n\n**So, what should you do?**\n\n1.  **Talk to a Doctor (Neurologist Recommended):** This is the most important step. Describe your experiences with the flashing lights (concert, TV show, the \"test\" video), and your feelings. Explain your concerns about epilepsy. A doctor can:\n    *   Take a thorough medical history.\n    *   Perform a neurological exam.\n    *   Order an EEG (electroencephalogram). This test measures brain activity and can help detect seizure activity, even if you haven't had a noticeable seizure. A specific type of EEG, called a photoparoxysmal response (PPR) test, is done to measure the presence of photosensitivity.\n\n2.  **Avoid Potential Triggers Until You See a Doctor:**  Until you have a diagnosis, try to minimize your exposure to flashing lights and patterns. This might mean:\n    *   Being cautious at concerts or clubs.\n    *   Adjusting the brightness and contrast on your TV and computer screens.\n    *   Taking breaks from screen time.\n    *   Using blue light filters on your devices.\n    *   Being aware of potentially triggering scenes in movies or TV shows.\n\n3.  **Don't Self-Diagnose:**  Internet searches can be helpful for information, but they are not a substitute for professional medical advice. Don't try to diagnose yourself based on online \"tests\" or articles.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nIt's possible you *could* have a mild form of photosensitive epilepsy, but it's also entirely possible that you're just sensitive to flashing lights. The discomfort and unease you experienced could be related to anxiety. The best course of action is to see a doctor for proper evaluation and diagnosis. Don't panic, but do take it seriously and get it checked out.\n"

    "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your concern. Having these episodes is clearly impacting your life, and it's frustrating to have a potential diagnosis dismissed without further investigation. Here's a breakdown of what you've described, why you might be feeling worried, and what you can consider doing:\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Dizziness:** A common symptom with many potential causes.\n*   **Sharp Eye Pain:** Could be related to migraine, eye strain, or even nerve irritation.\n*   **Zoned Out Feeling:** A sign of altered consciousness.\n*   **Rapid Memories, Visions, Deja Vu:** These are particularly suggestive of temporal lobe activity. Deja vu is especially linked to the temporal lobe.\n*   **Blurred Vision:** Could be related to migraine, seizure activity, or other neurological issues.\n*   **Slurred Speech:** Indicates a disruption in motor control, which can occur during a seizure.\n*   **Hot Flushes:** Autonomic nervous system involvement, common in seizures and migraines.\n*   **Nausea/Feeling Sick:** Also related to autonomic nervous system activation.\n*   **Post-Episode Confusion/Lightheadedness:** This \"post-ictal\" state is common after seizures.\n*   **Memory Loss of Episode Contents:** Quite typical of seizures.\n*   **Frequency:** Three episodes in one day is definitely a significant change and warrants further attention.\n\n**Why You're Right to Be Concerned:**\n\n*   **Impact on Daily Life:** These episodes are disrupting your ability to function normally.\n*   **Possible Underlying Cause:** Even if the MRI was clear, something is clearly happening in your brain that needs further investigation.\n*   **Increased Frequency:** The fact that you had three episodes in one day is concerning. Any increase in frequency or severity should be addressed.\n*   **Safety Concerns:** If you experience these episodes while driving or in other potentially dangerous situations, they pose a significant risk.\n\n**Why the MRI Might Not Have Caught It:**\n\n*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) Can Be Subtle:**\n    *   **MRI Sensitivity:** MRI is good at detecting structural abnormalities (tumors, lesions, etc.). However, some cases of TLE have no visible structural abnormalities on MRI. The problem might be at the cellular or electrical level, which an MRI can't see.\n    *   **Timing:** If the abnormality is very subtle, it might only be apparent during an episode, which wouldn't be captured by a static MRI.\n*   **Other Possible Explanations:**\n    *   **Migraine Variants:** Some migraines can cause neurological symptoms that mimic seizures.\n    *   **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are other, less common, neurological conditions that could cause similar symptoms.\n    *   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These are seizure-like events that are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain but are instead related to psychological factors. (I'm not suggesting this is the case, but it's important to rule out).\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Schedule Another Appointment with Your Doctor (or a Different Doctor):**\n    *   **Express Your Concerns:** Clearly state that the increased frequency of episodes is significantly impacting your life and that you're not comfortable simply ignoring them.\n    *   **Question the \"Don't Worry\" Advice:** Explain that you're worried, and you need a more thorough evaluation.\n    *   **Advocate for Further Testing:** Specifically ask about the possibility of an **EEG (Electroencephalogram)**.\n\n2.  **Ask About an EEG:**\n    *   **What it is:** An EEG measures the electrical activity in your brain. It can help detect abnormal brainwave patterns associated with seizures.\n    *   **Types of EEGs:**\n        *   **Routine EEG:** A short recording (20-30 minutes) while you're awake and sometimes asleep.\n        *   **Sleep-Deprived EEG:** This is often more sensitive because sleep deprivation can trigger seizure activity.\n        *   **Ambulatory EEG:** This involves wearing a portable EEG recorder for 24 hours or longer. This can be helpful if your episodes are infrequent, as it increases the chance of capturing one.\n        *   **Video EEG Monitoring (VEEG):** This is the gold standard for diagnosing seizures. You're admitted to the hospital and continuously monitored with EEG and video recording for several days. This allows doctors to correlate your symptoms with any abnormal brain activity.\n\n3.  **Keep a Detailed Seizure Diary:**\n    *   **Date and Time of Each Episode**\n    *   **Specific Symptoms:** Describe exactly what you experience, in detail.\n    *   **Duration:** How long does each symptom last?\n    *   **Triggers:** Can you identify anything that seems to trigger the episodes (stress, sleep deprivation, flashing lights, etc.)?\n    *   **Medications:** List any medications you are taking\n    *   **Food/Drink:** List anything you have eaten/drank earlier in the day.\n    *   **Activities:** What were you doing right before the episode started?\n    *   **Post-Episode Effects:** How do you feel afterward?\n\n4.  **Consider Seeing a Neurologist:**\n    *   **Specialized Expertise:** A neurologist specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the nervous system, including epilepsy and migraines.\n    *   **Second Opinion:** A neurologist can review your medical history, examine you, and determine if further testing or treatment is needed.\n\n5.  **Don't Be Afraid to Seek a Second (or Third) Opinion:**\n    *   **Your Health is Important:** If you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting, it's perfectly acceptable to seek another medical opinion.\n\n6.  **Discuss Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) with your doctor or specialist.**\n    *   **This will not fix the problem, however, it can help lessen the severity of the episodes.**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** If you are having seizures, you should not drive until you are seizure-free for a certain period (usually several months) and your doctor has given you the okay.\n*   **Safety Precautions:** Discuss with your doctor about what to do if you feel an episode coming on. Avoid situations that could be dangerous if you were to have a seizure (e.g., swimming alone, climbing ladders).\n*   **Stress Management:** Stress can sometimes trigger seizures or migraines. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n*   **Support:** Talk to family, friends, or a therapist about your concerns. Dealing with these symptoms can be emotionally challenging. Consider joining a support group for people with epilepsy or similar conditions.\n\n**In summary, your symptoms warrant further investigation, especially with the increased frequency. Push for an EEG, preferably an ambulatory or video EEG, and consider seeking a neurologist for a specialized evaluation. Don't be afraid to advocate for your health and get the answers you need.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "My current age is 31. Height: 5'7\" Weight: 140 lbs. I have been having convulsive seizures almost every month since I turned 26. These seizures almost exclusively occur within an hour of waking up. I walk around the house for up to half an hour, burning up. Could stress be a trigger for these episodes? I also have times where I get euphoric and nauseous, but they never last very long.Basically, what I want to know is, what is going on in my head. Is this temporal lobe epilepsy? Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex and concerning situation, and I understand why you're seeking answers. It's important to reiterate that **I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations. This information is for educational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice.** You need to consult with a neurologist as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, I can break down your symptoms and discuss potential possibilities to help you understand what questions to ask your doctor.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of your situation and potential considerations:**\n\n*   **Seizure History:**\n    *   **Onset:** Started at age 26. This is considered adult-onset epilepsy.\n    *   **Frequency:** Almost monthly, and recently much more frequent (9 seizures on Monday). This indicates a worsening of seizure control.\n    *   **Timing:** Almost exclusively within an hour of waking. This is a significant clue. Seizures upon waking are often associated with certain types of epilepsy.\n    *   **Characteristics:**\n        *   Convulsive (likely tonic-clonic, or grand mal, seizures).\n        *   Walking around, \"burning up.\" This suggests possible automatisms (unconscious, repetitive behaviors) and altered consciousness during the seizure or post-ictal phase (the period after a seizure).\n\n*   **Associated Symptoms:**\n    *   **Euphoria and nausea:** These are highly suggestive. Euphoria, in particular, is a common symptom of temporal lobe seizures. Nausea can also be associated with certain seizure types.\n\n*   **Current Medication:**\n    *   **Keppra (Levetiracetam) not working:** This is crucial information. It means you need a different medication or combination of medications.\n\n*   **Possible Diagnoses (to discuss with your neurologist):**\n\n    *   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):** This is a very strong possibility given your symptoms.\n        *   *Why TLE is suspected:*\n            *   Euphoria and nausea are common \"auras\" (warning signs) of TLE.\n            *   Automatisms (walking around) are frequently seen in TLE.\n            *   Seizures upon waking can be more common in TLE.\n        *   *Further Investigations:* Your neurologist will likely order:\n            *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  An EEG can show abnormal electrical activity in the brain, especially in the temporal lobes, even between seizures.  A sleep-deprived EEG is often used to increase the chances of capturing abnormalities.\n            *   **MRI of the Brain:** This is essential to look for structural abnormalities in the temporal lobes, such as hippocampal sclerosis (scarring of the hippocampus, a part of the temporal lobe), tumors, or other lesions.\n    *   **Focal Onset Seizures with Secondary Generalization:** This means the seizure starts in one specific area of the brain (a \"focal onset\") and then spreads to involve the whole brain, causing a convulsive seizure.  TLE is a *type* of focal onset epilepsy. It's important to determine *where* the seizure is starting.\n        *   *Why this is important:* Identifying the focal onset is crucial for treatment.\n\n    *   **Other Types of Epilepsy:** While TLE is a strong possibility, your neurologist will consider other types of epilepsy based on the EEG and MRI results.  There are many different types of epilepsy, and accurate diagnosis is key to effective treatment.\n\n*   **Triggers:**\n\n    *   **Stress:** Stress can absolutely be a seizure trigger for many people with epilepsy.\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Because your seizures happen when waking up, sleep deprivation could very likely be a trigger.\n    *   **Other Triggers:** Other common triggers include:\n        *   Alcohol\n        *   Missing medication doses\n        *   Hormonal changes (in women)\n        *   Illness\n\n*   **Regarding \"Burning Up\":** The sensation of \"burning up\" could be related to autonomic nervous system changes during or after the seizure. Seizures can affect heart rate, sweating, and other bodily functions controlled by the autonomic nervous system.\n\n**Next Steps - What you NEED to do:**\n\n1.  **See a Neurologist Immediately:**  Do not delay.  The increase in seizure frequency is alarming.\n2.  **Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Keep a very detailed seizure diary.  Record:\n    *   Date and time of each seizure.\n    *   What you were doing immediately before the seizure.\n    *   Any possible triggers (stress, lack of sleep, missed medication, etc.).\n    *   A detailed description of what happens *during* the seizure (including any auras, automatisms, and the convulsive phase).\n    *   What happens *after* the seizure (post-ictal phase) \u2013 how long it takes to recover, any confusion, weakness, etc.\n3.  **Bring a Witness to Your Appointments:** If possible, bring someone who has witnessed your seizures to the appointments. Their observations can be invaluable to the neurologist.\n4.  **Ask Specific Questions:**  Go to your appointment prepared to ask the following questions:\n    *   \"Based on my symptoms, is temporal lobe epilepsy a likely diagnosis?\"\n    *   \"What specific tests (EEG, MRI) are needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions?\"\n    *   \"Since Keppra is not working, what other anti-seizure medications would you recommend, and why?\"\n    *   \"What are the potential side effects of these medications?\"\n    *   \"Are there any lifestyle changes (stress reduction techniques, sleep hygiene) that could help control my seizures?\"\n    *   \"If medications are not fully effective, are there other treatment options, such as surgery or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)?\"\n\n**Regarding Anti-Seizure Medications:**\n\nSince Keppra isn't working, your neurologist will consider other options. Some commonly used anti-seizure medications include:\n\n*   **Lamotrigine (Lamictal):** Often a good first-line choice, particularly for focal seizures.\n*   **Carbamazepine (Tegretol):** Can be effective for temporal lobe epilepsy, but has potential drug interactions.\n*   **Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal):** Similar to carbamazepine, but often better tolerated.\n*   **Topiramate (Topamax):** Can be effective, but has potential cognitive side effects.\n*   **Zonisamide (Zonegran):** Another option, but can also have cognitive side effects.\n*   **Valproic Acid (Depakote):** Broad-spectrum, but has significant side effects, especially in women of childbearing age.\n*   **Lacosamide (Vimpat):** Can be added to other medications.\n\n*The choice of medication depends on the type of epilepsy, potential side effects, other medical conditions, and individual patient factors.*\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** You likely cannot drive until your seizures are well-controlled.  This is for your safety and the safety of others.  Your neurologist will advise you on the specific laws in your state.\n*   **Safety:** Take precautions to prevent injury during seizures, such as avoiding swimming alone or working at heights.\n*   **Support:** Join a support group for people with epilepsy.  This can provide valuable emotional support and practical advice. The Epilepsy Foundation is a great resource: [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n\n**In summary, your symptoms strongly suggest temporal lobe epilepsy or another type of focal onset epilepsy. The fact that Keppra is not working means you need to see a neurologist urgently to explore other medication options and further diagnostic testing. Be prepared with a detailed seizure diary and a list of questions.**\n\n**Please remember, this is not medical advice. See a neurologist as soon as possible.** Good luck!\n"

    "question": "25 Male, 186 CM, 93 KG.I was happy that Johnson vaccine finally arrived at my country. However I started reading about it, there were some concerns reported last month that it may cause Neurological disorder and muscle paralysis.So as a someone who is treating from mild epilepsy (occurred to me only 4 times and usually my diagnosis are good) for about 6 years , should I be concerned about it ? also if I have the chance to take AstraZeneca should I do it ?Would appreciate your response because I can't reach to my Dr. at the moment",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the situation and try to provide some helpful information.  Given that you have a history of mild epilepsy, it's understandable that you're concerned about potential neurological side effects from any vaccine.\n\n**Understanding the Concerns About Johnson & Johnson (J&J/Janssen) Vaccine**\n\n*   **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS):** The reports you're likely referring to are about a *slightly* increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) following the J&J vaccine.  GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. It's important to put this risk into perspective:\n\n    *   **Rarity:** The overall risk of GBS after the J&J vaccine is *very* low.  While there was an observed increase compared to the general population, the numbers are still small.  Authorities like the FDA and CDC have investigated this and continue to state that the benefits of the J&J vaccine outweigh the risks for most people.\n    *   **Monitoring:** The CDC and other health organizations continue to monitor for adverse events after all COVID-19 vaccines.\n    *   **Causation vs. Association:** It's crucial to remember that an *association* doesn't necessarily mean *causation*.  Just because GBS was reported after vaccination doesn't automatically mean the vaccine *caused* it. There could be other factors involved.\n\n*   **Your Epilepsy:** Your history of epilepsy is the crucial factor here. Some sources suggest increased risk from vaccines to individuals who are dealing with neurological disorders but it is not that straight forward.\n\n**AstraZeneca vs. Johnson & Johnson**\n\n*   **AstraZeneca and Thrombosis (TTS):** AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to rare blood clots.\n\n**Recommendations (With Strong Caveats)**\n\n**Given your specific situation (male, age 25, history of mild epilepsy), and the limited information I can provide without a full medical evaluation, the safest course of action is to err on the side of caution.**\n\n**Here's what I would suggest (again, keeping in mind this is NOT a substitute for consulting your doctor):**\n\n1.  **Wait for Your Doctor:** *The best course of action is to wait until you can speak with your doctor.* They know your medical history and can assess your individual risk factors and provide personalized advice. Your doctor should be able to help you choose the vaccine with the lowest risk based on your specific medical history and circumstances. If waiting longer than a week, I would suggest getting second opinion in order to be safe.\n2.  **Consider an mRNA Vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna):** If available in your country, mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) have not been associated with an increased risk of GBS.  If you can't reach your doctor soon, and mRNA vaccines are an option, they might be the *relatively* safest choice based on current data.\n3.  **If J&J or AstraZeneca are the only options:** This is where the decision becomes much more complex. Discuss the risk vs reward very carefully with your doctor, focusing on:\n\n    *   **Your Epilepsy Control:** How well is your epilepsy currently controlled?  Are you on medication? How long have you been seizure-free?\n    *   **Local COVID-19 Situation:** What is the prevalence of COVID-19 in your area? The higher the risk of infection, the stronger the argument for vaccination (even with a small risk).\n\n**Regardless of which vaccine you receive, be vigilant for any unusual symptoms, especially:**\n\n*   Weakness in your limbs\n*   Difficulty with coordination\n*   Numbness or tingling\n*   Double vision\n*   Difficulty swallowing or speaking\n*   Severe headache\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **This is NOT medical advice.** I am an AI and cannot provide medical recommendations. You *must* consult with your doctor.\n*   **Vaccine availability varies.** The options I've suggested may not be available in your country.\n*   **New information is constantly emerging.** Vaccine recommendations may change.\n\nGood luck, and I strongly urge you to connect with your doctor or another qualified medical professional as soon as possible.\n"

    "question": "I\u2019m (19M) 6 foot 2, 74kg. I\u2019m on clobasam and tegratol for my epilepsy . Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don\u2019t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It\u2019s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit! All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down this complex situation with alcohol, epilepsy, and your specific circumstances. It's good you're being thoughtful and proactive about this. You're right, it's often hard to get a definitive, personalized answer on this topic from doctors, and here's why, followed by the information you need to make informed decisions.\n\n**Why Doctors Are Cautious and Non-Specific:**\n\n*   **Liability:** Doctors are inherently cautious. Giving specific permission to exceed recommended alcohol limits opens them up to potential liability if something goes wrong.\n*   **Individual Variability:** Epilepsy is a spectrum. Triggers vary significantly from person to person. What affects one epileptic person might not affect another. This makes it difficult to give blanket advice.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Clobazam and Tegretol *both* have potential interactions with alcohol, and these can be unpredictable.\n*   **Seizure Threshold:** Alcohol lowers the seizure threshold, making seizures more likely in susceptible individuals.\n*   **Sleep Deprivation:** Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture. Lack of sleep is a well-known seizure trigger for many people with epilepsy, especially those with nocturnal seizures.\n*   **Lack of Predictability:** Even if you've been \"fine\" so far, that doesn't guarantee future safety. Tolerance to alcohol's effects *doesn't* equal tolerance to its seizure-inducing potential.\n\n**The Key Information You Need:**\n\n1.  **Alcohol and Epilepsy: The General Risks:**\n\n    *   **Lowered Seizure Threshold:** Alcohol directly affects brain activity, making seizures more likely.\n    *   **Medication Interactions:**\n        *   **Clobazam (Onfi):** Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of clobazam, leading to increased drowsiness, impaired coordination, and potentially respiratory depression (especially at higher doses).\n        *   **Tegretol (Carbamazepine):** Alcohol can alter the metabolism of Tegretol, potentially leading to either higher-than-expected blood levels (increasing side effects) or lower-than-expected blood levels (reducing its effectiveness in controlling seizures).\n    *   **Sleep Disruption:** Alcohol interferes with sleep cycles, which is particularly relevant for your nocturnal epilepsy.\n    *   **Missed Medication Doses:** Alcohol intoxication can lead to forgetting to take your medication, drastically increasing seizure risk.\n    *   **Dehydration:** Alcohol is a diuretic, leading to dehydration, which can be a seizure trigger for some.\n\n2.  **\"Are Some Epileptics Able to Drink Like Anyone Else?\": The Harsh Reality**\n\n    *   **Technically Possible, But Highly Unlikely to Be Fully \"Like Anyone Else\":**  While some individuals with well-controlled epilepsy *may* be able to tolerate small amounts of alcohol without immediate, obvious consequences, the underlying risk is *always* higher than in someone without epilepsy.\n    *   **\"Fine So Far\" Doesn't Mean \"Always Fine\":**  Just because you haven't had a seizure after drinking in the past doesn't mean you're immune. Epilepsy can be unpredictable, and triggers can accumulate.\n    *   **Medication Adjustments:** It is possible to use alcohol cautiously, however this would include consultation with a doctor to discuss adjusting your medications around alcohol consumption. This is very complex as blood levels for medications such as tegretol need to be closely monitored.\n\n3.  **Your Specific Situation:**\n\n    *   **Nocturnal Epilepsy:** This is a significant factor. Alcohol's disruption of sleep architecture is *directly* relevant to your seizure pattern. You're essentially playing with fire more than someone whose seizures are triggered by other factors.\n    *   **Clobazam and Tegretol:** The combination of these medications and alcohol requires extra caution due to the potential for additive sedative effects and altered Tegretol metabolism.\n    *   **Increasing Tolerance:**  The fact that you've gradually increased your alcohol intake and \"felt fine\" is *not* a reliable indicator of safety. You might be building a *behavioral* tolerance to alcohol's effects (feeling less drunk), but that doesn't change its impact on your brain and seizure threshold.\n    *   **Age:** You're 19. The brain is still developing at this age, and heavy alcohol consumption can have longer-term consequences.\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n\n1.  **Honest and Open Discussion with Your Doctor:** You *must* have a frank and detailed conversation with your neurologist.  Be honest about your current drinking habits, your desire to drink more, and your understanding of the risks.  Ask specific questions like:\n    *   \"What are the specific risks of clobazam and Tegretol interacting with the amounts of alcohol I'm drinking?\"\n    *   \"How does alcohol affect sleep architecture and how does that relate to my nocturnal seizures?\"\n    *   \"What blood tests or monitoring can be done to assess the impact of alcohol on my Tegretol levels?\"\n    *   \"Is it possible to adjust my medications around alcohol consumption?\"\n    *   \"What are the signs I should watch out for that indicate I'm nearing my limit?\"\n    *   \"Are there other lifestyle factors (stress, diet, etc.) that I should be aware of in relation to alcohol and seizures?\"\n2.  **Consider Dose Reduction:** If you find that you are able to reduce your medication doses in conjunction with your doctor, it is possible that this may allow you to consume more alcohol without affecting seizure control.\n3.  **Don't Experiment Alone:** Do not attempt to increase your alcohol consumption without medical guidance. This is extremely risky.\n4.  **Prioritize Sleep:** If you choose to drink at all, prioritize getting a full night's sleep afterwards. Avoid alcohol if you know you'll have a disrupted sleep schedule.\n5.  **Pace Yourself and Stay Hydrated:** If you drink, drink slowly and alternate alcoholic beverages with water.\n6.  **Inform Others:** Make sure your friends know about your epilepsy and what to do if you have a seizure.\n7.  **Consider Abstinence:** The safest option, of course, is to abstain from alcohol altogether. While this might not be what you want to hear, it eliminates the risks entirely.\n8.  **Monitor and Document:** If you do drink, keep a detailed log of:\n    *   How much you drank (specific amounts and types of alcohol)\n    *   How you felt (physical and mental state)\n    *   Your sleep quality\n    *   Whether you took your medication as prescribed\n    *   Any unusual symptoms or warning signs\n    *   Any changes in your seizure frequency or pattern\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nYou *have* been lucky so far.  Don't push your luck further.  The potential consequences of a seizure are significant, and the interaction of alcohol, your medications, and your nocturnal epilepsy is a dangerous combination. You need to prioritize your health and safety.  Talk to your doctor, be honest about your desires, and make informed decisions based on the best medical advice.  It's okay to want to enjoy yourself, but not at the expense of your well-being.\n"

    "question": "21F. I pretty much have generalized hyperhidrosis but the sweating in my feet, hands, and underarms are what bother me the most. I\u2019ve been looking into Iontophoresis but read that people with epilepsy might not be able to use this treatment. Anyone know anything about this? Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "You're right to be cautious and investigate this potential interaction. Here's what I know about iontophoresis and epilepsy:\n\n**The Concern: Electrical Stimulation**\n\n*   Iontophoresis uses a mild electrical current to deliver ions into the skin, typically tap water.\n*   Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n*   The concern is that, in theory, the electrical stimulation from iontophoresis *might* trigger a seizure in someone susceptible to them.\n\n**What the Research and Expert Opinions Say:**\n\n*   **Limited Research:** There's not a ton of high-quality research specifically investigating iontophoresis use in people with epilepsy. This makes it difficult to give a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\n*   **Caution is Advised:** Most experts advise caution, particularly for individuals with poorly controlled epilepsy or those who have seizures frequently.\n*   **Case Reports:** There have been rare case reports or anecdotes suggesting a potential link between electrical stimulation therapies (not specifically iontophoresis) and seizures in susceptible individuals.\n*   **Manufacturers' Warnings:** Many iontophoresis machine manufacturers include warnings in their user manuals against use by individuals with epilepsy.\n\n**Important Considerations & Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Neurologist is a must!** This is the most important step. Before considering iontophoresis, you *must* discuss it with your neurologist. They are the best person to assess your individual risk based on:\n    *   The type and severity of your epilepsy\n    *   How well-controlled your seizures are\n    *   Your overall health\n    *   Potential interactions with your epilepsy medications\n\n2.  **Dermatologist Consultation:** If your neurologist gives you the go-ahead (or is unsure), consult a dermatologist experienced in treating hyperhidrosis. They can:\n    *   Discuss alternative treatments if iontophoresis is deemed too risky.\n    *   If iontophoresis is considered, they can advise on proper use, starting with the lowest possible current, and carefully monitoring for any adverse effects.\n\n3.  **Start Low and Go Slow (If Approved):** If your doctors approve, you would likely start with a very low current setting and gradually increase it only if tolerated. The goal is to find the lowest effective current that controls your sweating without any concerning side effects.\n\n4.  **Constant Monitoring:** During iontophoresis treatments, you (or someone with you) should be vigilant for any signs of a seizure, such as:\n    *   Changes in awareness or consciousness\n    *   Muscle twitching or jerking\n    *   Staring\n    *   Confusion\n\n5.  **Be Prepared:** If you decide to try iontophoresis, make sure someone is with you during the initial sessions, and that they know what to do if you were to have a seizure (e.g., how to turn off the machine, call for help).\n\n**Alternatives to Iontophoresis:**\n\nIf iontophoresis is not a safe option for you, discuss alternative treatments with your dermatologist, such as:\n\n*   **Topical antiperspirants:** Prescription-strength options containing aluminum chloride.\n*   **Oral medications:** Anticholinergics (these can have side effects).\n*   **Botulinum toxin injections (Botox):** Effective for underarm sweating.\n*   **miraDry:** A non-invasive procedure that permanently reduces underarm sweat and odor glands.\n*   **Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS):** A surgical option (usually reserved for severe cases and carries risks).\n\n**In summary: You absolutely need to consult with both your neurologist and a dermatologist before considering iontophoresis if you have epilepsy. It might be possible under strict medical supervision, but it's crucial to weigh the potential risks and benefits carefully.**\n"

    "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",

    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the long-term effects of your epilepsy and the potential impact on your brain health. It's frustrating when you feel like you're not getting the information and support you need from your doctor.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your questions and some general information. **It's crucial to remember that this is not a substitute for personalized medical advice. You need to discuss your specific case with a neurologist who can dedicate the time to thoroughly address your concerns.**\n\n**Does epilepsy increase the risk of brain-related diseases with time?**\n\nThe relationship between epilepsy and the long-term risk of other brain diseases is complex and still being researched. Here's a simplified view:\n\n*   **Increased Risk for Some Conditions:** Some studies suggest an association between epilepsy and a slightly increased risk of certain neurological conditions later in life. These can include:\n    *   **Cognitive Decline/Dementia:** Epilepsy, especially if poorly controlled, has been linked to a possible increased risk of cognitive decline or dementia later in life. This is an area of active research, and the specific type of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and other factors likely play a role.\n    *   **Stroke:** Some types of seizures and conditions associated with epilepsy can slightly increase the risk of stroke.\n    *   **Depression and Anxiety:** Epilepsy is often associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety.\n*   **Factors Influencing Risk:** Several factors can influence your individual risk:\n    *   **Type of Epilepsy:** The specific type of epilepsy you have is crucial. As you mentioned, your type is not well-understood, making it difficult to predict long-term effects definitively.\n    *   **Seizure Control:** Well-controlled epilepsy with minimal seizures is generally associated with a lower risk of long-term complications.\n    *   **Underlying Cause:** If your epilepsy is caused by an underlying brain condition (e.g., a lesion, malformation), that condition itself can influence your long-term brain health.\n    *   **Medications:** Long-term use of some anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can have side effects that might affect cognitive function or other aspects of brain health. However, the benefits of seizure control often outweigh these risks.\n    *   **Lifestyle Factors:** Healthy lifestyle choices like a balanced diet, regular exercise, good sleep, and stress management can help protect your brain health.\n\n**Are seizures and partial seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all costs?**\n\n*   **Yes, seizures and partial seizures can be harmful to the brain.** Each seizure event involves abnormal electrical activity that can potentially damage brain cells, especially if seizures are frequent, prolonged, or severe.\n*   **Seizures can cause:**\n    *   **Excitotoxicity:** Excessive release of neurotransmitters (like glutamate) can overstimulate brain cells and lead to cell death.\n    *   **Hypoxia:** During a seizure, breathing can be impaired, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the brain.\n    *   **Physical Injury:** Falls or other injuries during a seizure can cause head trauma.\n*   **Controlling seizures is the primary goal of epilepsy treatment.** Minimizing seizure frequency and severity is essential for protecting your brain health and preventing long-term complications.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Find a Neurologist Who Will Listen:** Your doctor's dismissive attitude is unacceptable. You deserve a neurologist who is willing to answer your questions, address your concerns, and work with you to develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Consider seeking a second opinion or finding a new neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.\n2.  **Prepare for Your Next Appointment:** Before your rescheduled appointment, write down all your questions and concerns. Prioritize them so you can address the most important ones first. If your doctor seems rushed, politely but firmly insist on getting your questions answered.\n3.  **Consider an Epilepsy Specialist:** If possible, seek care from an epileptologist, a neurologist with specialized training in epilepsy. They have more in-depth knowledge of epilepsy syndromes, diagnostic techniques, and treatment options.\n4.  **Advocate for Yourself:** You are your best advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek second opinions, and insist on receiving the information and care you need.\n5.  **Focus on Lifestyle Factors:** Continue to prioritize sleep, medication adherence, and stress management. These factors can significantly impact your seizure control and overall brain health.\n6.  **Explore Support Groups:** Consider joining an epilepsy support group. Connecting with others who have epilepsy can provide valuable emotional support, practical advice, and a sense of community.\n\n**Specific Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"What are the potential long-term risks associated with my specific type of epilepsy?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific tests or monitoring that I should undergo to assess my brain health over time?\"\n*   \"How can I optimize my treatment plan to minimize seizure frequency and potential long-term complications?\"\n*   \"Are there any lifestyle changes or therapies that I can implement to protect my brain health?\"\n*   \"What are the potential cognitive side effects of my current medications, and are there alternative options?\"\n*   \"What should I do if I experience memory problems or cognitive changes?\"\n\nRemember, your concerns are valid, and you deserve to have your questions answered. Don't give up on finding a healthcare provider who will work with you to manage your epilepsy and protect your brain health."

    "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",

    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned and overthinking these episodes, especially with the upcoming sleep-deprived EEG. It's good that you're being proactive and observing these experiences. Here's a breakdown of your concerns and some thoughts to consider:\n\n**Regarding Your Experiences:**\n\n*   **\"Spacing out\" and saying \"what?\"**: This can be quite common, and doesn't automatically indicate a seizure. Causes can include:\n    *   **Inattentiveness/Mind Wandering:** Everyone spaces out sometimes! Stress, fatigue, anxiety, or simply being preoccupied can make it difficult to focus on conversations.\n    *   **Auditory Processing Issues:** Sometimes, even if you *hear* the words, your brain doesn't fully process them immediately, leading to the \"what?\" response.\n    *   **ADHD:** Inattentive-type ADHD can present as difficulty focusing, being easily distracted, and having trouble following conversations.\n    *   **Anxiety/Depression:** These conditions can affect concentration and cognitive function.\n    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Lack of sleep impairs cognitive function and attention.\n\n*   **Staring Spells:** These are more concerning, especially with the history of flashing light sensitivity.\n    *   **Absence Seizures:** These typically involve a brief loss of awareness, often accompanied by staring. They usually last only a few seconds, and the person returns to normal quickly.\n    *   **Complex Partial Seizures:** These can involve staring, automatisms (repetitive movements like lip smacking or hand gestures), and confusion afterwards.\n    *   **Daydreaming/Dissociation:** People can get lost in thought and \"zone out\" for short periods without it being a seizure. The \"good\" feeling you describe *could* be consistent with dissociation, but it's impossible to know for sure without medical evaluation.\n    *   **Focal Seizures:** These can occur in one part of the brain and cause a variety of symptoms.\n\n**Epilepsy Considerations:**\n\n*   **Late-Onset Epilepsy:** While epilepsy often starts in childhood, it *absolutely* can develop later in life. Possible causes of late-onset epilepsy include:\n    *   **Brain Injury:** Even mild head trauma can sometimes lead to epilepsy years later.\n    *   **Stroke:** Even small, unnoticed strokes can cause seizures.\n    *   **Brain Tumors:** Although less common.\n    *   **Infections:** Encephalitis or meningitis.\n    *   **Genetic Factors:** Some people may have a genetic predisposition to seizures that doesn't manifest until later in life.\n    *   **Unknown Cause (Idiopathic):** Many cases of late-onset epilepsy have no identifiable cause.\n\n*   **Epilepsy Without Grand Mal Seizures:** It's important to remember that epilepsy is a spectrum.  Some people only experience absence seizures or focal seizures. You don't *have* to have a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure to have epilepsy.\n\n*   **Misdiagnosis/Underdiagnosis:**  Sometimes, subtle seizures are mistaken for other conditions or simply dismissed as normal behavior.\n\n**What to Do While You Wait for the EEG:**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Log:** This is crucial.  Document *every* episode, including:\n    *   **Date and Time:**\n    *   **What You Were Doing:**\n    *   **Your Sensations/Thoughts Before, During, and After:**\n    *   **Duration:** (Estimate as accurately as possible.)\n    *   **What Your Wife (or others) Observed:** (This is *very* important, as you might not be fully aware during the episode.)\n    *   **Any Triggers You Notice:** (Stress, flashing lights, lack of sleep, etc.)\n    *   **Food/Drink:** Before, During, After\n\n*   **Avoid Potential Triggers:** If you know flashing lights are an issue, avoid them. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule (difficult before a sleep-deprived EEG, but generally good practice).\n\n*   **Talk to Your Wife:** Have a frank conversation with her about what she observes during these episodes. Her input is invaluable.\n\n*   **Prepare Questions for Your Neurologist:** Write down all your concerns and questions so you don't forget anything during your appointment. Ask about the differential diagnosis (other possible causes) and what the next steps will be if the EEG is inconclusive.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's essential to get a professional medical evaluation.\n*   **The EEG is a Tool, Not a Definitive Answer:** A normal EEG doesn't always rule out epilepsy. Sometimes, multiple EEGs are needed, or other tests like an MRI.\n*   **There are Treatments Available:** If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, there are medications and other therapies that can help control seizures.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of the experiences you describe can be normal, the staring spells, especially in the context of flashing light sensitivity, warrant further investigation. The sleep-deprived EEG is a good first step. Keep detailed records, talk to your wife, and discuss your concerns thoroughly with your neurologist. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",

    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation and address your questions about folate and ferritin, their potential connection, and the possible impact on your epilepsy.\n\n**Understanding Your Results**\n\n*   **Folate (Serum):** Low at 3.89 ug/L (reference > 5.38 ug/L). This confirms a folate deficiency.\n*   **Ferritin:** Low at 14.2 ug/L (reference 10.0 - 291.0 ug/L). Ferritin is a measure of your iron stores. A low ferritin level indicates iron deficiency, though your hemoglobin levels might still be within the normal range if the deficiency is in its early stages.\n*   **Vitamin B12:** Normal at 398.0 ng/L (reference 211.0 - 911.0 ng/L).\n*   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** Very low at <4 mg/L (reference 0.0 - 6.0 mg/L). This indicates there is not notable inflammation in your body\n\n**Possible Connections Between Folate and Iron Deficiency**\n\nYou're right to question this, especially given your seemingly healthy diet. Here are a few possible connections:\n\n1.  **Dietary Intake Issues Beyond Calorie Count:** While you seem to be getting enough calories, it's important to look at the specific sources of folate and iron in your diet. While you eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, folate is particularly abundant in leafy green vegetables, legumes (beans, lentils), and fortified grains. Ferritin comes from meat (especially red), leafy greens etc, and the fact that you have both folate deficiency and ferritin deficiency may suggest that you may not be absorbing the folate and ferritin effectively, but that both deficiencies are a dietary deficiency. In cases like this, a dietician may be helpful.\n2.  **Absorption Issues:** Sometimes, even with a good diet, the body struggles to absorb these nutrients. This can be due to:\n\n    *   **Gut health:** Conditions like celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can interfere with nutrient absorption. I understand that your CRP is very low, which would argue against IBD, but the fact that you are deficient in both these micronutrients suggests to me that it is worth asking your doctor about issues relating to absorption\n    *   **Medications:** Certain medications can affect folate and iron absorption. While Keppra is less frequently associated with this compared to other anticonvulsants, any medication can potentially impact nutrient absorption.\n3.  **Increased Demand:** While unlikely given your controlled epilepsy and exercise habits, conditions that increase cell turnover can also increase the demand for folate and iron.\n\n**Could This Affect Your Epilepsy?**\n\nYes, potentially.\n\n*   **Folate Deficiency and Epilepsy:** Folate is important for brain function. In some individuals, folate deficiency has been linked to seizures or worsening seizure control.\n*   **Iron Deficiency and Epilepsy:** Iron also plays a role in brain function. Low iron levels can potentially lower the seizure threshold in some individuals, making them more susceptible to seizures.\n\n**Recommendations for Your Doctor's Appointment**\n\nDefinitely bring up your epilepsy and Keppra with your doctor. Specific questions to ask:\n\n1.  **Cause of Deficiencies:** \"What are the most likely causes of both my low folate and low ferritin, given my diet and medication?\" Discuss potential underlying issues like malabsorption.\n2.  **Further Testing:** \"Are there any further tests you recommend to investigate the cause, such as a celiac screen or tests for other absorption problems?\"\n3.  **Supplementation:** \"What dosage and form of folate and iron supplements do you recommend? How long should I take them? Should my levels be retested?\" Ask whether iron supplements will interfere with your epilepsy medication.\n4.  **Neurologist Consultation:** \"Given my epilepsy and these deficiencies, should I consult with my neurologist about potential adjustments to my medication or management plan?\"\n5.  **Dietitian Referral:** \"Would you recommend that I see a registered dietician to help me optimize my diet for folate and iron intake, and to ensure I am eating enough iron-containing food?\"\n\n**What You Can Do Now**\n\n*   **Keep a Food Diary:** Track your food intake in detail for a week or two. This can help you and your doctor identify potential dietary gaps or patterns.\n*   **Don't Self-Treat:** While it's tempting to start taking over-the-counter supplements, it's best to wait until you've spoken with your doctor to determine the correct dosage and avoid potential interactions with your medication.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"

    "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",

    "answer": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious after your son's first seizure and the subsequent diagnosis. It's a lot to process, and it's wise to be proactive in seeking information and understanding his condition and treatment options.\n\nLet's break down your questions, keeping in mind that I'm an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only, and you should ALWAYS consult with your son's neurologist or other qualified medical professionals for personalized guidance.\n\n**Understanding the EEG and Diagnosis**\n\n*   **Abnormal EEG Hours After the Event:** An EEG measures the electrical activity in the brain. Even after a seizure stops, the brain's electrical activity can remain disrupted for a period of time. This post-ictal (after seizure) state can show abnormalities on the EEG. The fact that the EEG was abnormal hours later supports the diagnosis of a possible seizure disorder.\n*   **Does He Always Have That Sort of EEG?** Not necessarily. People with epilepsy can have periods where their EEG is relatively normal (interictal) and periods where it shows abnormal activity, even when they aren't actively having a seizure. The goal of the video EEG is to capture seizure activity and interictal activity, giving a better picture of his specific type of epilepsy.\n*   **Could this Abnormal EEG Have Affected His Growth and Mental Development?** It's unlikely that a single abnormal EEG recording would have affected his growth or development. However, uncontrolled seizures *can* potentially impact cognitive development over time. This is one reason why treatment is often recommended. The medication aims to prevent future seizures, which is critical for a child.\n\n**Underlying Cause and MRI**\n\n*   **Should We Worry About Underlying Cause?** It's always reasonable to be thorough. Primary generalized epilepsy is often considered to have a genetic component, meaning there's no underlying structural cause in the brain. However, it's perfectly reasonable to ask your neurologist again about the specific reasons they decided *not* to pursue an MRI. If they feel the EEG pattern is highly characteristic of primary generalized epilepsy and the CT scan was clear, an MRI might not significantly change the treatment plan. However, if you are not comfortable, you have every right to push for further investigation.\n*   **Should We Get an MRI Done to Look for Scarring?** It's reasonable to discuss this further with your neurologist. If you remain concerned about an underlying structural cause, it's worth exploring.\n\n**Depakote (Valproic Acid)**\n\n*   **Realistically, What is the Quality of Life for My Son on Depakote?** This is a crucial question, and the answer is highly individual. Depakote *can* be effective in controlling seizures, but it also has potential side effects.\n    *   **Behavior Changes:** Some people experience mood changes, irritability, or difficulty concentrating.\n    *   **Hair Loss:** This is a potential side effect, but it doesn't happen to everyone.\n    *   **Liver Toxicity:** This is a serious concern, which is why regular blood tests are essential to monitor liver function.\n    *   **Weight Gain:** This is another potential side effect.\n    *   **Important Note:** Depakote has some risks for females if started before pregnancy. It's important to be aware of this, even though your son is only 9.\n    *   **Real Experience:** You'll find a range of experiences with Depakote. Some people tolerate it well and have excellent seizure control with minimal side effects. Others experience significant side effects that impact their quality of life. It's important to have open communication with your neurologist and report any concerns you have.\n*   **Can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?** This is a very important conversation to have with your neurologist. Here's why:\n    *   **CBD for Epilepsy:** While CBD has shown promise in treating some specific types of epilepsy (like Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), the evidence for its effectiveness in primary generalized epilepsy is still limited. It's also crucial to understand that CBD products are not consistently regulated, and their purity and potency can vary. Using CBD instead of a prescribed medication without medical supervision is risky.\n    *   **Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):** AEDs are the standard treatment for epilepsy. They have been extensively studied and proven effective in reducing seizure frequency and severity. While they have potential side effects, they are often the best way to prevent seizures and protect your child's brain.\n    *   **The Danger of Untreated Seizures:** Untreated or poorly controlled seizures can have negative consequences for brain development, learning, and overall health.\n    *   **Combining CBD and AEDs:** If you're interested in exploring CBD, *never* do it without your neurologist's knowledge and guidance. CBD can interact with some AEDs, potentially affecting their levels in the blood.\n    *   **Shared Decision-Making:** The goal is to find the treatment approach that works best for your son, balancing seizure control with quality of life. This requires open and honest communication with your neurologist.\n\n**Second/Third Opinions and Further Evaluation**\n\n*   **Should We Get a Second or a 3rd Opinion?** Absolutely. It's always a good idea to seek additional opinions, especially when you have concerns about the diagnosis or treatment plan.\n*   **Should We Get Another EEG or Just Show That EEG to Other Neurologists?** You can start by showing the existing EEG to other neurologists. They may want to order their own EEG for comparison, but at least they'll have the initial data to review.\n*   **What to Look for in a Second Opinion:** Look for a pediatric neurologist with expertise in epilepsy. Ideally, find someone at a comprehensive epilepsy center, which has a team of specialists (neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, etc.) who can provide a multidisciplinary evaluation.\n\n**Key Steps to Take**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Detailed Discussion with Your Neurologist:** Write down all your questions and concerns before the appointment. Ask about the reasons for the diagnosis, the rationale for choosing Depakote, the potential side effects, and the possibility of alternative treatments.\n2.  **Seek a Second Opinion:** Contact a pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy, preferably at a comprehensive epilepsy center.\n3.  **Document Seizures:** Keep a detailed seizure diary, noting the date, time, duration, and characteristics of any seizures your son experiences. This information will be valuable for your neurologist.\n4.  **Advocate for Your Son:** You are your son's best advocate. Don't hesitate to ask questions, express your concerns, and seek the best possible care for him.\n5.  **Educate Yourself:** Learn as much as you can about epilepsy and its treatment. Reliable sources of information include the Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).\n6.  **Find Support:** Connect with other parents of children with epilepsy. Sharing experiences and getting emotional support can be incredibly helpful. The Epilepsy Foundation has local chapters that offer support groups and resources.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Depakote**\n\n*   **Teratogenicity:** Depakote carries a significant risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy. This is a crucial consideration for females, even young girls, as it impacts future reproductive health decisions. Discuss this thoroughly with the neurologist.\n*   **Monitoring:** If Depakote is prescribed, regular blood tests are essential to monitor liver function and drug levels.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Many families face similar challenges. By being informed, proactive, and working closely with your medical team, you can help your son live a full and healthy life. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, based on your description and medical history, what you experienced is concerning and definitely warrants further investigation. While I cannot diagnose you, I can break down why this sounds potentially seizure-related and what steps you should take.\n\n**Why it *could* be a seizure:**\n\n*   **History of Epilepsy:** The fact that you have a history of epilepsy, even if it was in childhood, significantly increases the likelihood that this event could be seizure-related. While you haven't had seizures since starting your period, epilepsy can sometimes manifest differently or re-emerge later in life.\n*   **\"Aura\" Feeling:** You describing a \"deja vu\" feeling is a classic aura symptom. Auras are often the beginning of a seizure, even if a full-blown convulsive seizure doesn't follow.\n*   **The Event Itself:** The inability to move, open your eyes, or speak for 20 seconds, along with amplified sounds and internal vibrations, are atypical symptoms but still within the spectrum of what a seizure could present as. The fact that you were fully conscious makes typical sleep paralysis less likely.\n*   **Postictal State:** The exhaustion, grogginess, and feeling down mentally afterwards is consistent with a postictal state (the period after a seizure). This is often characterized by confusion, fatigue, and mood changes.\n\n**Why it might *not* be a classic seizure (and why you still need to get checked):**\n\n*   **Lack of Convulsions:** The absence of visible convulsions makes it less typical for a tonic-clonic (formerly grand mal) seizure. However, seizures can manifest in many ways, and focal seizures (those originating in one area of the brain) can have a variety of symptoms.\n*   **Factors that can cause similar symptoms:** Palpitations from too much caffeine and dehydration can cause sensations of \u201cvibrations\u201d which could\u2019ve just been your heart rate, and your anxiety could\u2019ve amplified it.\n\n**Contributing Factors & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Adderall and Espresso:** Adderall is a stimulant. Combining it with espresso beans and an espresso drink creates a high level of stimulation, which can lower the seizure threshold (making a seizure more likely). This combination can also cause anxiety, insomnia, and other neurological symptoms.\n*   **Alcohol:** Alcohol can both lower the seizure threshold and disrupt sleep. Alcohol withdrawal (even mild, after only three days) can sometimes trigger seizures.\n*   **Sleep Deprivation:** Being awake from 1 AM to 5 AM is a significant disruption of your sleep schedule. Sleep deprivation is a well-known trigger for seizures in people with epilepsy.\n*   **Medications:** While your medications themselves may not be directly causing seizures, it is important to consider potential interactions or effects on seizure threshold, especially with the added stimulants and alcohol.\n*   **Stress:** Starting a new job, especially in a high-stress environment like a bar, can contribute to anxiety and potentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Doctor Immediately:** This is the most important step. Explain what happened in detail. Emphasize your history of epilepsy, the \"aura\" feeling, and the unusual symptoms you experienced. It\u2019s better to be overly cautious.\n2.  **Neurologist Referral:** If your primary care doctor isn't a neurologist, request a referral to a neurologist. They are the specialists best equipped to evaluate and manage epilepsy and seizures.\n3.  **EEG:** A neurologist will likely recommend an electroencephalogram (EEG). This test measures brain activity and can help identify seizure activity or abnormalities that suggest an increased risk of seizures.\n4.  **Medication Review:** Discuss all your medications, including Adderall, Buspar, Omeprazole, and Dicyclomine, with your doctor. They may need to adjust dosages or explore alternative medications.\n5.  **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    *   **Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize a regular sleep schedule. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n    *   **Caffeine:** Significantly reduce or eliminate caffeine intake.\n    *   **Alcohol:** Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption, especially given your potential seizure risk.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Implement stress-reducing techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga.\n6.  **Keep a Seizure Diary:** Start documenting any unusual sensations, events, or potential triggers. This can help you and your doctor identify patterns.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Driving:** Depending on your state's laws and your doctor's recommendations, you may need to temporarily stop driving until you have been evaluated and cleared by a neurologist.\n*   **Work Environment:** Be mindful of your work environment. Discuss potential risks and accommodations with your employer if needed.\n*   **Don't Panic:** While this is concerning, try to remain calm. Many seizures are treatable with medication and lifestyle modifications.\n\n**In summary, what you described sounds suspicious for a seizure, especially given your history. It is crucial to seek medical attention promptly for proper evaluation and diagnosis. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of action.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand your situation. It sounds incredibly stressful dealing with the aftermath of the car accident, the uncertainty around your health, and the financial limitations preventing you from getting the proper medical attention. Let's break down the possible explanations for your pain and what you can do in the meantime:\n\n**Possible Causes of Your Left-Sided Chest/Rib Pain After the Accident:**\n\n*   **Rib Contusions/Fractures:** Even without visible bruising, rib contusions (bruises) are very common in car accidents, especially with seatbelt use. The seatbelt is designed to restrain you, and that force can cause significant bruising or even hairline fractures.\n*   **Muscle Strain:** The force of the impact, even at relatively low speeds, can strain the muscles in your chest wall and around your ribs.\n*   **Costochondritis:** This is inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your sternum. It can cause sharp, localized pain that worsens with movement or pressure.\n*   **Lung Contusion (Pulmonary Contusion):** This is bruising of the lung tissue itself. It's often associated with blunt trauma to the chest. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood (though that's not always present). *This is a significant concern.*\n*   **Pleurisy:** Inflammation of the pleura, the lining around the lungs. This can cause sharp chest pain that worsens with breathing.\n*   **Internal Organ Injury:** While less likely at lower speeds, there's still a possibility of injury to internal organs like the spleen (on your left side), especially if there was direct impact to that area.\n*   **Referred Pain:** Pain from another area of the body can sometimes be felt in the chest or rib area.\n\n**Why your symptoms raise concerns:**\n\n*   **Constant Pressure:** The constant pressure you describe is concerning because it doesn't fit neatly into the picture of a simple muscle strain or rib contusion. It could suggest inflammation, fluid buildup, or pressure on the lung itself.\n*   **Association with your heart and lung:** Pain specifically around your heart and lung area needs to be investigated to rule out serious issues.\n*   **Lack of Improvement:** If the pain is severe and not improving with the anti-inflammatory steroids and pain relief creams, it's a sign that something more serious could be going on.\n\n**Given your situation and limited resources, here's what I would advise:**\n\n1.  **Continue the Steroids as Prescribed:** Follow your doctor's instructions for the steroid course. Monitor how the pain responds during and after the treatment.\n\n2.  **Strict Self-Monitoring:**\n    *   **Breathing:** Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, even mild? Does your chest feel tight?\n    *   **Cough:** Are you coughing? Is there any blood in your sputum (phlegm)?\n    *   **Pain Levels:** Keep a log of your pain levels throughout the day. Note what activities worsen or relieve the pain.\n    *   **Fever:** Check your temperature regularly.\n    *   **Other Symptoms:** Pay attention to any other symptoms, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n3.  **When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention (ER Visit):**\n    *   **Significant Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing, wheezing, or feeling like you can't get enough air.\n    *   **Severe Chest Pain:** Especially if it feels like a crushing or squeezing sensation.\n    *   **Coughing Up Blood:** Any amount of blood in your sputum is a red flag.\n    *   **Dizziness or Fainting:**\n    *   **Rapid Heart Rate or Irregular Heartbeat:**\n    *   **Sudden, Severe Abdominal Pain:**\n    *   **Worsening of Symptoms Despite Treatment:** If the steroids and pain relief measures are not providing any relief or your symptoms are getting worse.\n\n4.  **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of your symptoms, treatments, and responses. This will be extremely valuable when you finally see a doctor.\n\n5.  **Explore Options for Affordable Care:**\n    *   **Local Health Departments:** Contact your local health department. They may offer low-cost or free medical services.\n    *   **Community Clinics:** Search for community clinics or free clinics in your area.\n    *   **Hospital Financial Assistance Programs:** Many hospitals have financial assistance programs that can help reduce the cost of care.\n    *   **211:** Dial 211 to be connected to health and human service programs in your community.\n    *   **Medicaid:** Explore Medicaid eligibility in your state.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Your Seizures and Driving:**\n\n*   **Driving Restrictions:** Many states have laws regarding driving after a seizure. These laws vary, but generally, you're required to be seizure-free for a certain period (often 3-6 months) before you can legally drive again. Your recent diagnosis and the accident will likely trigger mandatory reporting requirements.\n*   **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Driving with uncontrolled seizures is incredibly dangerous and puts yourself and others at risk. It also carries significant legal consequences if you were to have another accident.\n*   **Neurologist is crucial:** Given your history of seizures and the recent incident, it is really important that you see a neurologist as soon as possible. They can properly diagnose your seizure type, adjust your medication, and provide guidance on driving restrictions.\n\n**Regarding your concerns about a growth/tumor:**\n\nIt's good that your doctor checked you for any lumps. While the pain could be related to the accident, it's still important to follow up if the pain persists or worsens after treatment.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *This information is for general guidance and informational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.*\n\nI know this is a difficult situation, but please prioritize your health and safety. Do everything you can to seek the medical attention you need, and be very cautious about driving until your seizures are well-controlled and you have clearance from a neurologist.\n"

I\u2019m 16 years old and I just want this gone. I\u2019m so sick and tired of the fear.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a really important decision, and it's understandable that you're feeling scared and overwhelmed. Let's break down the situation and the factors you need to consider.  I am not a medical professional, and this is not a substitute for medical advice. It is crucial to discuss all of this in detail with your doctor and potentially a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy surgery.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n*   **Complex Epilepsy:** You're dealing with frontal lobe nocturnal tonic-clonic epilepsy. Frontal lobe epilepsy can be challenging to manage with medication alone, and nocturnal seizures present unique safety concerns.\n*   **Multiple Medications:** You're already on a significant number of medications (Onfi, Lamictal XR, Buspirone, Celexa, Quillivant, 5-HTP, Melatonin, Omega Fatty Acid, and birth control pills). This suggests that your seizures are not well-controlled, or your doctor is trying to manage a range of symptoms related to your other conditions. Adding more medication might not be the most effective long-term solution.\n*   **Quality of Life:** You express a strong desire to be rid of the fear and the impact of seizures on your life. This is a valid and crucial consideration.\n*   **SUDep Anxiety:** Your fear of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is understandable. It's a real risk, and it's natural to be concerned.\n\n**Evaluating the Proposed Tests**\n\nYour doctor is suggesting a series of tests to determine if you're a candidate for epilepsy surgery:\n\n*   **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography):** This scan shows brain activity. It can help identify the area where seizures originate, even between seizures.\n*   **CAT Scan (Computerized Axial Tomography):** This is an imaging technique that uses x-rays to see detailed images of your organs, bones, soft tissue and blood vessels.\n*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** Provides a very detailed image of the brain's structure. It can help identify lesions, tumors, or other abnormalities that might be causing the seizures.\n\n**Why These Tests Are Important:**\n\nThese tests are **essential** to determine:\n\n1.  **Where the seizures are starting:** Precisely locating the seizure focus (the area of the brain where seizures begin).\n2.  **If the seizure focus is resectable:** Can the problematic area be surgically removed without causing unacceptable damage to other brain functions (like speech, movement, or memory)?\n3.  **If surgery is likely to be effective:** Based on the location and nature of the seizure focus, what is the likelihood that surgery will significantly reduce or eliminate your seizures?\n\n**Weighing the Pros and Cons of Testing and Potential Surgery**\n\n**Pros of Proceeding with Testing:**\n\n*   **Potential for Seizure Freedom or Significant Reduction:** Surgery offers the possibility of significantly reducing or even eliminating seizures, leading to a better quality of life.\n*   **Reduced Medication Burden:** If surgery is successful, you might be able to reduce or eliminate some of your medications, potentially reducing side effects.\n*   **Reduced SUDEP Risk:** While surgery itself carries some risks, successful seizure control can reduce the overall risk of SUDEP in the long term.\n*   **Informed Decision-Making:** The tests provide crucial information to make an informed decision about whether surgery is a viable option.\n\n**Cons of Proceeding with Testing:**\n\n*   **Risk of Seizure During Testing:** You mentioned the need to have a seizure during testing. This is often required to accurately pinpoint the seizure focus. It's understandable to be scared, but medical teams are prepared to manage seizures during these procedures.\n*   **Anxiety and Stress:** The entire process of testing and considering surgery can be stressful and anxiety-provoking.\n*   **False Hope:** The tests might reveal that you're not a suitable candidate for surgery.\n*   **Potential Risks of Surgery (if you proceed):** Surgery carries risks like infection, bleeding, stroke, and cognitive deficits. The specific risks depend on the location of the surgery and the individual.\n\n**What to Consider Regarding SUDep**\n\n*   **Increased Monitoring During Testing:** During the tests where a seizure is induced, you will be closely monitored. Medical professionals will be prepared to intervene if necessary.\n*   **Surgical Reduction:** If you are a candidate for surgery, and the surgery is successful, your SUDEP risk could be reduced.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Doctor and the Surgical Team:**\n\nBefore making a decision, you need to have a very thorough discussion with your doctor and, if possible, a neurosurgeon specializing in epilepsy surgery. Here are some critical questions to ask:\n\n*   **What is the specific protocol for inducing a seizure during the tests?** What monitoring will be in place? What medications will be available to stop the seizure if needed?\n*   **What are the specific risks associated with each test (PET scan, CAT scan, MRI)?**\n*   **If the tests identify a potential surgical target, what are the specific risks associated with that particular surgery?** What are the potential impacts on my cognitive function (memory, language, etc.)? What is the likelihood of complications?\n*   **What is the success rate for this type of surgery (frontal lobe epilepsy) at your center?** What does \"success\" mean (e.g., seizure-free, significant reduction in seizure frequency)?\n*   **What are the alternative treatments if I'm not a candidate for surgery?** Are there newer medications or therapies (like responsive neurostimulation or deep brain stimulation) that might be appropriate?\n*   **What is the long-term outlook with and without surgery?** What are the potential impacts on my quality of life?\n*   **Can I speak with other patients who have undergone similar surgery?**\n\n**My Thoughts**\n\nGiven your age, the number of medications you're taking, and the impact of seizures on your life, I think pursuing the testing is a reasonable step. The information gained from the tests is crucial for making an informed decision about whether surgery is a viable option.\n\n**Here's what I recommend you do:**\n\n1.  **Have a detailed conversation with your doctor:** Discuss all of your concerns and ask the questions listed above.\n2.  **Get a second opinion:** Consult with a neurologist or epilepsy specialist at a comprehensive epilepsy center.\n3.  **Involve your family:** Make sure your parents or guardians are fully informed and involved in the decision-making process.\n4.  **Consider counseling:** Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you cope with the anxiety and stress associated with this process.\n\nThis is a tough situation, but you're taking the right steps by seeking information and considering your options. Remember that you are not alone, and there are people who can support you through this process. Don't rush into anything, and make sure you feel comfortable and confident with your decision.\n\n**Most importantly, listen to your gut and advocate for what you need.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.\n"

    "answer": "Okay, it sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation. Having both epilepsy and now dystonia, and feeling like your medication isn't fully effective, is understandably frustrating. Let's break down some information you can consider and potential questions you can ask your doctor.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation:**\n\n*   **Generalized Dystonia Attack:**  A dystonia attack involves involuntary muscle contractions that can cause twisting, repetitive movements, or abnormal postures.  Since this is your first experience, it's important to understand what might have triggered it.\n*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:**  Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a type of epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobe of the brain. It can cause a variety of seizures, including focal seizures with or without impaired awareness, and sometimes generalize to tonic-clonic seizures.\n*   **Keppra & Prozac:** You are currently on Keppra and Prozac. Keppra is a common medication used to treat epilepsy. Prozac is an antidepressant used to treat depression and other mood disorders. It's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to also experience mood disorders.\n\n**Possible Connections & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy & Dystonia:** While not always directly linked, there is evidence of connections. Epilepsy itself or some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can, in rare cases, contribute to movement disorders like dystonia. Additionally, the underlying brain dysfunction causing the epilepsy could also increase susceptibility to dystonia.\n*   **Keppra & Dystonia:** Rarely, Keppra can be associated with dystonia as a side effect. While it's not a common side effect, it is something to consider, especially since the dystonia started after you were on Keppra.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** It's always important to review potential interactions between Keppra and Prozac with your doctor or pharmacist, although generally, these are considered safe to use together.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor (regarding both Epilepsy and Dystonia):**\n\nHere's a list of questions, broken down into categories, to help you have a productive conversation with your doctor:\n\n**1. Regarding the Dystonia Diagnosis & Cause:**\n\n*   \"Can you help me understand why I developed generalized dystonia?\"\n*   \"Is there a way to determine if my dystonia is related to my epilepsy, my epilepsy medication (Keppra), or a completely separate issue?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific tests (like blood work, imaging, or genetic testing) that could help identify the underlying cause of my dystonia?\"\n*   \"What are the different types of dystonia, and what type do I have?\n*   What is the prognosis for my dystonia?\n\n**2. Regarding Current Medications & Alternative Options:**\n\n*   \"Could Keppra be contributing to my dystonia? If so, are there alternative anti-epileptic medications we could consider that are less likely to cause dystonia?\"\n*   \"Are there other medications besides Keppra that might be more effective for controlling my temporal lobe epilepsy, given that I'm still having seizures (or that you're feeling like it's not working optimally)?\"\n*   \"Are there any medications specifically for treating the dystonia?\" (e.g., Botox injections, muscle relaxants, anticholinergics).  Understand the potential side effects of any new medications.\n*   \"Is there any data to suggest that the Prozac I am taking could be making either my epilepsy or dystonia worse?\"\n\n**3. Regarding Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**\n\n*   \"Given my epilepsy and now dystonia, am I a potential candidate for deep brain stimulation (DBS)?\"\n*   \"What are the specific criteria for DBS eligibility for epilepsy and/or dystonia at your center?\"\n*   \"What are the potential benefits and risks of DBS for my specific type of epilepsy (temporal lobe) and my type of dystonia?\"\n*   \"What is the typical DBS procedure like (surgery, recovery, programming)?\"\n*   \"What is the long-term management of DBS, and what kind of follow-up care is required?\"\n*   \"How successful is DBS for patients with epilepsy *and* dystonia compared to patients with only one of these conditions?\"\n*   \"Are there any alternatives to DBS, such as Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) or Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS), that might be worth considering?\"\n\n**4. Regarding Lifestyle & Supportive Therapies:**\n\n*   \"Are there any lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, exercise, stress management) that could help manage my epilepsy and/or dystonia?\"\n*   \"Would physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy (if applicable based on dystonia symptoms) be beneficial for me?\"\n*   \"Are there any support groups or resources for people with epilepsy and/or dystonia in my area or online?\"\n\n**5. Regarding Further Evaluation & Specialists:**\n\n*   \"Would you recommend I see a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders, in addition to my epilepsy specialist?\" (A movement disorder specialist can provide a more in-depth evaluation and treatment plan for the dystonia.)\n*   \"Should I undergo any further epilepsy testing, such as a prolonged EEG monitoring or high-resolution MRI, to better characterize my seizure activity?\"\n*   \"If DBS is an option, can you refer me to a neurosurgeon experienced in DBS for epilepsy and/or dystonia?\"\n\n**Important Considerations for DBS:**\n\n*   **DBS for Epilepsy:**  DBS for epilepsy is typically considered for individuals who have tried multiple antiepileptic drugs and are still experiencing frequent, disabling seizures.  It's not a first-line treatment. The most common target for DBS in epilepsy is the anterior nucleus of the thalamus.\n*   **DBS for Dystonia:** DBS is more established for certain types of dystonia.  The most common target for DBS in dystonia is the globus pallidus interna (GPi).\n*   **DBS for Both:**  It's more complex when considering DBS for both conditions.  It's crucial to find a center with experience in both epilepsy and movement disorder DBS, as the targeting and programming may need to be carefully considered to address both conditions.\n*   **Realistic Expectations:**  DBS is not a cure. It aims to reduce seizure frequency or dystonia symptoms, but you may still need medication.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Document Your Symptoms:** Keep a detailed log of your seizure activity, dystonia episodes, any potential triggers, and how you're feeling in general. This information will be invaluable for your doctor.\n2.  **Bring a List of Questions:**  Prioritize the questions above that are most important to you.\n3.  **Take Notes:** During your appointment, take notes on what your doctor says.\n4.  **Advocate for Yourself:** You are the expert on your own body. If you feel like something isn't right, don't hesitate to speak up and ask for further evaluation or a second opinion.\n5.  **Get a Second Opinion:** If you're unsure about your doctor's recommendations, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist, particularly one with expertise in both epilepsy and movement disorders.\n\nI hope this information helps you prepare for your appointment and gives you a better understanding of your options.  Good luck!\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex and concerning situation. It's important to preface this by saying that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a substitute for consultation with qualified medical professionals. Your girlfriend needs close monitoring and management by her neurology team.\n\n**Summary of the Situation:**\n\n*   **Initial Presentation:** High fevers, unresponsiveness, and concerning head movements leading to prolonged seizures and ICU admission in January 2017.\n*   **ICU Course:**  Uncontrolled seizures, induced coma, multiple AEDs (phenytoin, levetiracetam, sodium valproate), normal MRI, no definitive autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis despite testing.\n*   **Treatment:** Initially treated with prednisone and IVIG, then discharged after ~3.5 weeks.\n*   **Recurrent Seizures:** Seizure-free period followed by return of seizures.\n*   **Current Seizure Type:** Conscious, but with head, mouth, and eye movements resembling a tonic-clonic seizure, suggestive of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). Frequent (approx. 2x/week), nocturnal.\n*   **Current Medications:** Phenytoin 300mg, Levetiracetam 2500mg, Sodium Valproate 2400mg.\n*   **Planned Medication Change:**  Introduction of Vimpat (lacosamide) under consideration.\n\n**Addressing Your Questions:**\n\n1.  **\"Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER.\"**\n\n    *   **Highly likely.**  Unresponsiveness and repetitive head movements in the context of a fever and subsequent seizures are highly suggestive of seizure activity. This could absolutely have been a manifestation of status epilepticus, especially given the subsequent prolonged seizures in the ER and ICU. Status epilepticus is defined as a continuous seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness in between for more than 5 minutes. Given the description of her being unresponsive and the 8.5-minute seizure, it's very probable she was in status epilepticus.\n\n2.  **\"What are your thoughts on what she had?\"**\n\n    This is the most difficult question to answer without being her doctor and having access to all her medical records and tests.  Here are some possibilities, ranked in order of most probable based on the information provided, but this is **speculative**:\n\n    *   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):** The seizure semiology (head and eye movements, preserved consciousness, often originating in the left temporal lobe) strongly points towards TLE. This could have been triggered by something specific to her, or her initial infection may have triggered this. *This is the most probable cause, in my opinion*.\n\n    *   **Febrile Status Epilepticus leading to Epilepsy:** Febrile status epilepticus can, in some cases, lead to the development of chronic epilepsy. This means the initial infection and high fever might have triggered the first seizure, damaged the brain in a way that made it more susceptible to future seizures, leading to TLE.\n\n    *   **Encephalitis (Possible, but less likely):** You mention autoimmune encephalitis was considered. Since the spinal taps came back negative this would indicate that this is unlikely. Although, in some cases, encephalitis can have subtle or atypical presentations, making it difficult to diagnose definitively.\n\n    *   **Cryptogenic Epilepsy:** This means the cause of the epilepsy is unknown despite thorough investigation. It's a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes are ruled out.\n\n3.  **\"What are your thoughts on the current medication?\"**\n\n    *   **Polytherapy:** Your girlfriend is currently on three anti-seizure medications (phenytoin, levetiracetam, and sodium valproate). Using multiple AEDs (polytherapy) is common in difficult-to-control epilepsy. However, it also increases the risk of side effects.\n\n    *   **Medication Levels and Optimization:** It's crucial to ensure that the blood levels of each medication are within the therapeutic range. Periodic blood tests should be done to check the levels of phenytoin and valproate.\n\n    *   **Vimpat (Lacosamide):** Adding Vimpat is a reasonable approach if her seizures are not adequately controlled with the current regimen. Vimpat has a different mechanism of action compared to the other medications, so it may be effective in reducing seizure frequency.\n\n    *   **Side Effects:** With three AEDs, it's essential to monitor for side effects. Each medication has a unique side effect profile. Common side effects of these medications include fatigue, dizziness, mood changes, cognitive impairment, and gastrointestinal issues. It is important that you and your girlfriend communicate any changes to your doctor.\n\n    *   **Consider a Comprehensive Epilepsy Center:** If seizures remain uncontrolled despite multiple medications, referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center should be considered. These centers have specialists who can offer more advanced diagnostic and treatment options, including detailed EEG monitoring, advanced imaging, and epilepsy surgery evaluation.\n\n    *   **Dietary Changes:** Some doctors recommend following a ketogenic diet to help with seizures.\n\n**Next Steps & Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Video Documentation:** Continue to record the seizures. This is invaluable for the neurologist to observe the seizure semiology directly.\n2.  **Neurology Follow-Up:** Schedule a detailed appointment with her neurologist as soon as possible to discuss the ongoing seizures, medication adjustments, and potential further investigations.\n3.  **EEG Monitoring:** Consider repeating the EEG, especially if it hasn't been done recently. A prolonged EEG study, ideally with video monitoring, may be helpful to capture a seizure and better characterize its origin.\n4.  **Neuropsychological Testing:** If cognitive issues persist, neuropsychological testing can help identify specific areas of impairment and guide rehabilitation strategies.\n5.  **Counseling/Support:** Epilepsy can have a significant impact on quality of life. Consider seeking counseling or joining a support group for both your girlfriend and yourself.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP):** While rare, SUDEP is a risk in epilepsy, particularly in those with uncontrolled seizures. Discuss this risk with her neurologist.\n*   **Driving:** Discuss driving restrictions with her neurologist, as seizures can impair driving ability.\n*   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage a healthy lifestyle with regular sleep, stress management, and avoidance of known seizure triggers (if any).\n\nIt's a long and frustrating road when dealing with uncontrolled seizures, but with careful management and ongoing monitoring, you can hopefully find a regimen that provides better seizure control and improves your girlfriend's quality of life. Advocate for her, ask questions, and be an active partner in her care. Again, this information is not a substitute for medical advice, and you should seek the opinion of your girlfriend's doctor for the most accurate and specific medical advice.\n"

    "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, it sounds like you've had a significant realization and you're now understandably trying to figure out the best course of action. Let's break down your situation and address your questions:\n\n**Yes, it's entirely possible you have a form of epilepsy.**\n\nBased on your description, the events you experienced *do* sound like seizures. The fact that they were triggered by physical sensations (being hit by a baseball and ear piercing) is interesting, and while not all seizures have obvious triggers, some do. The presence of an aura, the ictal (seizure) phase itself, and the post-ictal phase with its associated symptoms, all strongly suggest seizure activity. The fact that you experienced spiritual connections after the seizure also is something that is associated with epilepsy.\n\n**You absolutely should get tested and see a doctor.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Diagnosis is key:** It's crucial to get an accurate diagnosis from a medical professional. Self-diagnosing based on online research is never a substitute for a doctor's evaluation.\n*   **Rule out other causes:** While seizures are a strong possibility, a doctor will want to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, such as syncope (fainting) with convulsive movements, cardiac issues, or other neurological conditions.\n*   **Determine the type of epilepsy (if applicable):** There are many different types of epilepsy, and knowing the specific type is important for treatment and management.\n*   **Assess risk:** Understanding the frequency and severity of your seizures will help you and your doctor assess the risk of future events.\n*   **Discuss treatment options:** If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, there are various treatment options available, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, surgery.\n*   **Safety:** Getting a diagnosis can help you take precautions to minimize risks associated with seizures, such as driving, swimming, or operating heavy machinery.\n\n**What kind of doctor should you see?**\n\n*   **Start with your primary care physician (PCP):** Your PCP can take a detailed medical history, perform a basic physical exam, and refer you to the appropriate specialist.\n*   **Neurologist:** A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system. They are the most qualified to diagnose and manage epilepsy.\n*   **Epileptologist:** An epileptologist is a neurologist with specialized training in epilepsy. If your seizures are difficult to control or you need more advanced testing, your neurologist might refer you to an epileptologist.\n\n**What kind of tests might you expect?**\n\n*   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This is the most common test for diagnosing epilepsy. It measures the electrical activity in your brain using electrodes attached to your scalp.\n*   **MRI of the brain:** This can help identify any structural abnormalities in your brain that might be causing seizures.\n*   **Blood tests:** These can help rule out other medical conditions that might be causing seizures.\n\n**Implications of a diagnosis of epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Driving:** Depending on the laws in your state/country and the frequency and severity of your seizures, you may have restrictions on driving.\n*   **Lifestyle modifications:** You may need to make some lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of seizures, such as avoiding triggers (if known), getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding alcohol or recreational drugs.\n*   **Medication:** If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, you may need to take medication to control your seizures.\n*   **Social and emotional impact:** A diagnosis of epilepsy can have a significant impact on your social and emotional well-being. It's important to seek support from family, friends, or a therapist if you are struggling to cope.\n\n**Should you be worried or are you making a big deal out of nothing?**\n\nIt's understandable to feel worried and uncertain, but you're not making a big deal out of nothing. Experiencing two events that are very likely seizures warrants medical attention. While it *is* possible that these were isolated events that won't recur, it's far better to be proactive and get checked out. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve your quality of life and reduce the risk of future complications.\n\n**Here's a step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Schedule an appointment with your PCP:** Explain your concerns and the events you experienced.\n2.  **Keep a seizure diary:** If you experience any further events, record as much detail as possible, including:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   What you were doing before the event\n    *   Any potential triggers (stress, lack of sleep, etc.)\n    *   The specific symptoms you experienced (aura, convulsions, loss of consciousness, etc.)\n    *   How long the event lasted\n    *   What you felt like afterward (post-ictal phase)\n3.  **Follow your doctor's recommendations:** This may include referral to a neurologist, undergoing diagnostic testing, and starting treatment if necessary.\n\nIt's important to remember that epilepsy is a manageable condition with proper medical care. By taking these steps, you'll be empowering yourself to understand your situation, get the right diagnosis, and make informed decisions about your health. Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions.\n"

    "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",

    "answer": "It's commendable that you're researching potential interactions between your epilepsy medications and HRT. It demonstrates a proactive approach to your healthcare. I understand your desire to gather information before discussing this with your neurologist.\n\nIt's important to state clearly that **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.** The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for consulting with qualified healthcare professionals, including your neurologist and an endocrinologist or physician specializing in HRT. They can assess your specific situation, medical history, and medications to provide personalized guidance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential interactions and points to consider, keeping in mind that research in this specific area is limited:\n\n**1. Potential Mechanisms of Interaction:**\n\n*   **Hepatic Metabolism:**  Many HRT medications (particularly oral estrogen) are metabolized in the liver.  Depakote (valproic acid) and Keppra (levetiracetam) are also processed, at least in part, by the liver.  Hormones can influence the activity of liver enzymes (like cytochrome P450 enzymes) that are involved in drug metabolism. This could potentially:\n    *   Change the levels of Depakote and/or Keppra in your body.\n    *   Change the levels of HRT medications.\n    *   The alteration of drug levels could lead to either reduced seizure control (if AED levels decrease) or increased side effects (if AED levels increase).\n*   **Hormonal Effects on Seizure Threshold:**  Estrogen, in particular, can have complex and sometimes pro-convulsant effects in the brain. While progesterone is generally considered to have anticonvulsant effects.  Changes in estrogen levels due to HRT might, theoretically, lower the seizure threshold in some individuals. The balance between estrogen and progesterone is crucial. This is also highly individual.\n\n**2. Specific Considerations for Your Medications:**\n\n*   **Depakote (Valproic Acid):** Valproic acid is known to be affected by hormonal changes.\n    *   **Estrogen:**  Estrogen can theoretically increase the clearance of valproic acid, potentially lowering its levels and reducing seizure control.\n    *   **Protein Binding:** Valproic acid is highly protein-bound in the blood. Estrogens can affect protein binding, which could alter the free (active) fraction of valproic acid.\n    *   **Monitoring:**  If you start HRT, close monitoring of valproic acid levels is essential, and dosage adjustments may be needed.\n*   **Keppra (Levetiracetam):** Levetiracetam is generally considered to have fewer drug interactions than many other AEDs, as it is primarily cleared by renal excretion. However, that doesn't mean interactions are impossible.\n    *   **Limited Data:** There's less specific published data on interactions between Keppra and HRT compared to Depakote.\n    *   **Individual Variability:** Even with Keppra's relatively straightforward metabolism, individual responses can vary.\n*   **Dosages:** Your dosages of both Depakote and Keppra are on the higher side of the typical range. This is relevant because even small changes in drug metabolism could have a more noticeable impact at higher doses.\n\n**3. HRT Regimen Considerations:**\n\n*   **Type of HRT:**  The specific type of estrogen and progesterone used in HRT matters.  Oral estrogens have a greater first-pass effect in the liver than transdermal (patch or gel) estrogens.  The route of administration can, therefore, influence the potential for interaction.\n*   **Dosage of HRT:** The starting and maintenance dosages of HRT will influence the potential for interaction.\n*   **Progesterone/Progestin:** The type and dose of progestogen can have varying effects. Some progestins may be more likely to interact with AED metabolism than others.\n*   **Monitoring:** You will require very close monitoring of blood work and seizure activity.\n* **Anti-Androgen medications.** You may also need to consider the addition of these medications as part of your transition, and therefore, a greater range of medications to monitor and consider side effects for.\n\n**4.  Important Considerations Regarding your specific Epilepsy**\n\n*   **Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME):** JME is often highly sensitive to sleep deprivation and hormonal fluctuations.  HRT-induced hormonal changes could theoretically increase the risk of myoclonic seizures.\n*   **Triggers:** You've identified sleep and anxiety as seizure triggers.  HRT can sometimes affect sleep and mood, which could indirectly impact seizure control. Managing these triggers proactively will be important.\n\n**5. Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consult Your Neurologist:** It's crucial to discuss your plans for HRT with your neurologist *before* starting any HRT regimen.  Explain your concerns and ask about potential interactions with Depakote and Keppra. Don't let shyness prevent you from having this important conversation. If necessary, write down your questions beforehand.\n2.  **Consult an Endocrinologist or HRT Specialist:**  Seek out a physician experienced in transgender hormone therapy. They should be aware of potential drug interactions and can work with your neurologist to develop a safe and effective HRT plan.\n3.  **Baseline Blood Tests:**  Before starting HRT, get baseline blood levels of Depakote and, if your neurologist recommends it, Keppra.\n4.  **Close Monitoring:** Once you start HRT, monitor your seizure frequency very carefully.  Keep a seizure diary.  Get regular blood tests to check your Depakote levels and adjust the dosage as needed. Work with both your neurologist and HRT provider to make adjustments.\n5.  **Open Communication:**  Maintain open communication between your neurologist, endocrinologist/HRT provider, and your primary care physician.\n6.  **Gradual Changes:** Start HRT at a low dose and increase it gradually, as directed by your HRT provider. This will allow for closer monitoring and adjustments as needed.\n7.  **Address Sleep and Anxiety:**  Prioritize good sleep hygiene and manage anxiety effectively. Consider non-pharmacological approaches (e.g., therapy, mindfulness) and, if necessary, discuss medication options with your doctors that have minimal interaction with your AEDs.\n8.  **Consider a Team:** Think of your medical care as a team approach. Your neurologist specializes in your seizure disorder, and an endocrinologist or HRT specialist specializes in hormone therapy. Effective communication is key to a successful treatment plan.\n\n**In summary:**  While specific data on interactions between Depakote, Keppra, and HRT in the context of gender-affirming care is limited, potential interactions exist.  Close monitoring, proactive communication with your healthcare providers, and careful management of your epilepsy triggers are essential. Your neurologist and HRT provider can work together to develop a safe and personalized treatment plan."

    "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

    "answer": "Okay, that sounds like a really challenging and stressful situation for you and your family. It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and overwhelmed. It's good that you're seeking information to better advocate for your mom. Here are some possible avenues to explore with her doctors, keeping in mind I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice:\n\n**Regarding the Falls/Seizures:**\n\n*   **Detailed Seizure Description:** You've provided a great description. Emphasize the specific details to the doctor:\n    *   The leg shaking, \"surfboard\" analogy.\n    *   The fact that she is **conscious and coherent** during these events.\n    *   That the falls seem to originate with the legs giving out.\n    *   The prior incoherence she had at first.\n*   **Differentiation of Seizure Types:** Explore whether these could be different types of seizures. Since she remains conscious, these might be simple partial seizures (focal aware seizures) or even non-epileptic events.\n*   **Video Recordings:** If possible, try to safely record a video of one of these events. This can be invaluable for the doctor to see exactly what's happening. Be sure to prioritize her safety first; don't put her at risk trying to get a recording.\n*   **Underlying Cause of Falls:** Even if the events are seizures, consider other contributing factors to the falls:\n    *   **Blood Pressure:** With multiple blood pressure medications, it's crucial to monitor for orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing), which can cause dizziness and falls. Have her doctor check her blood pressure while lying down, sitting, and standing.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:** Gabapentin and Depakote both have side effects that can contribute to dizziness, unsteadiness, and falls.\n    *   **Neuropathy:** Ask about peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), especially given the Gabapentin use. This can cause weakness and numbness in the legs, leading to falls.\n    *   **Muscle Weakness:** General muscle weakness, potentially from inactivity or medication side effects, could contribute.\n*   **EEG Monitoring:** While the initial EEG may have led to the epilepsy diagnosis, consider if repeat or extended EEG monitoring (like an ambulatory EEG that she wears for several days) might be helpful.\n\n**Regarding Cognitive Changes (Memory Loss, Confusion, Spelling Difficulties):**\n\n*   **Medication Review is CRUCIAL:** You are right to be concerned about the medications.\n    *   **Drug Interactions:** Insist that the doctor thoroughly review all medications for potential interactions and additive side effects. Gabapentin and Depakote can both cause cognitive impairment, and the combination could exacerbate this.\n    *   **Medication Levels:** Make sure her Depakote levels are being regularly monitored and are within the therapeutic range.\n    *   **Gradual Titration:** If any medication changes are made, advocate for a very slow and gradual titration (increase or decrease of the dose) to minimize withdrawal effects and allow the brain to adjust.\n    *   **Polypharmacy:** Having multiple medications concurrently is a big concern, especially at this age, and really focusing on decreasing as many medications as possible to what is needed should be a focus.\n*   **Dementia/Cognitive Impairment Workup:** Even though you suspect medication side effects, it's important to rule out other causes of cognitive decline.\n    *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** This detailed testing can assess different areas of cognitive function (memory, attention, language, etc.) and provide a baseline for comparison.\n    *   **Brain Imaging:** You mentioned plaque on the brain. Discuss with the doctor whether further brain imaging (MRI or PET scan) is warranted to assess for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or other conditions.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** Rule out vitamin deficiencies (B12, folate), thyroid problems, and other medical conditions that can affect cognition.\n*   **Sleep Apnea:** Untreated sleep apnea can cause cognitive problems. If she snores or is excessively tired during the day, ask about a sleep study.\n\n**Regarding Smoking:**\n\n*   **Smoking Cessation:** I know this is difficult, but strongly encourage her to quit smoking. It exacerbates many health problems, including blood pressure, heart disease, and cognitive decline. Talk to her doctor about smoking cessation aids (medication, nicotine patches, counseling).\n\n**Advocacy Tips:**\n\n*   **Prepare a List:** Before each appointment, write down a detailed list of your concerns, observations, and questions.\n*   **Bring Someone With You:** Having another family member or friend present at appointments can help you remember information and advocate for your mom.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask Questions:** If you don't understand something, ask the doctor to explain it in simpler terms.\n*   **Seek a Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the care your mom is receiving, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another neurologist or geriatrician.\n*   **Be Assertive:** You know your mom best. Trust your instincts and advocate for her needs, even if it means challenging the doctor.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Geriatric Assessment:** If possible, consider a comprehensive geriatric assessment. This involves a multidisciplinary team (doctor, nurse, social worker, therapist) evaluating all aspects of her health and well-being.\n*   **Social Support:** Connect with local resources for caregivers and seniors. This can provide support, education, and respite care.\n*   **Legal and Financial Planning:** Discuss with your mom the importance of advance directives (living will, durable power of attorney for healthcare) to ensure her wishes are followed if she becomes unable to make decisions for herself.\n\n**Regarding Your Anxiety:**\n\n*   **Therapy:** Talking to a therapist can help you cope with your anxiety and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n*   **Support Groups:** Joining a support group for caregivers can connect you with others who understand what you're going through.\n*   **Self-Care:** Make time for activities that you enjoy and that help you relax.\n*   **Balance:** It's understandable that you want to be there for your mom, but it's also important to pursue your own goals and dreams. Don't feel guilty about wanting to have a career.\n\nIt's a lot to take in, but remember to focus on one step at a time. Start by preparing a detailed list of concerns for her next doctor's appointment. Your dedication to your mom is admirable.\n"

    "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It sounds like you've seen a significant and positive transformation in your daughter since discontinuing valproic acid. Here's a breakdown of possible explanations for the changes you've observed, keeping in mind I'm an AI and cannot provide medical advice:\n\n**Possible Explanations for the Observed Changes:**\n\n*   **Cognitive Slowing and \"Fog\":** Valproic acid, even at low doses, can sometimes have cognitive side effects in certain individuals. This can manifest as:\n    *   **Slower Processing Speed:** Difficulty in quickly understanding and responding to information.\n    *   **Cognitive \"Fog\":** A general feeling of mental sluggishness, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory.\n    *   **Reduced Awareness:** This is a common feeling when you're not at peak mental performance.\n\n    By stopping the medication, this cognitive \"fog\" may have lifted, allowing your daughter to process information more efficiently, understand her surroundings better, and engage more fully in her environment. This could directly impact her language, communication, and ability to follow directions.\n\n*   **Impact on Mood and Emotional Regulation:** While valproic acid *is* used as a mood stabilizer, its effects are complex. In some individuals, it can:\n    *   **Flatten Emotions:** It can reduce the intensity of both positive and negative emotions. This might have inadvertently suppressed her natural emotional expression, including her happiness and her ability to express frustration or sadness appropriately.\n    *   **Cause Emotional Instability:** Paradoxically, in some people, valproic acid can *contribute* to mood swings. This is less common, but it's possible her sadness and crying spells are her system adjusting to not having the medication.\n\n    Coming off the medication could allow her to experience a wider range of emotions and express them more authentically. The occasional sadness you're seeing could be her learning to process and express feelings that were previously muted.\n\n*   **Synergistic Effects with ADD/ADHD & PDD:** It's important to consider how valproic acid may have interacted with her pre-existing diagnoses of ADD/ADHD and PDD.\n    *   **ADHD:** Valproic acid is not typically used to treat ADHD. However, if it caused cognitive slowing, it could have exacerbated her attention and impulsivity issues. Removing the medication might have improved her ability to focus and control her impulses, even without specific ADHD medication.\n    *   **PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder):** PDD encompasses a range of developmental challenges. If the valproic acid was creating cognitive slowing or affecting her social-emotional awareness, it could have made her PDD-related difficulties more pronounced.\n\n*   **Natural Development & Maturation:** It's also crucial to acknowledge that children continue to develop and mature, especially during the ages of 5-7. Some of the improvements you're seeing could be a result of her natural developmental trajectory, independent of the medication change.\n\n*   **Dosage Sensitivity:** Even though the dose was considered low, people respond to medications differently. Some individuals are highly sensitive to the effects, even at minimal doses.\n\n**Important Considerations and Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Communicate Closely with Your Daughter's Doctors:** This is paramount.\n    *   **Neurologist:** Continue to monitor her for any return of seizures. Document any mood swings or behavioral changes.\n    *   **Developmental Pediatrician/Therapist:** Discuss the observed improvements and any remaining challenges. They can assess her development and adjust therapies accordingly.\n    *   **Psychiatrist:** If the mood swings become frequent or concerning, a consultation with a child psychiatrist might be helpful to rule out any underlying mood disorders and to discuss strategies for managing emotional regulation.\n*   **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed log of her behavior, moods, communication skills, and any other relevant observations. This information will be invaluable to her doctors.\n*   **Consider Formal Assessments:**\n    *   **Cognitive Testing:** Repeat cognitive testing may be helpful to objectify the change.\n    *   **Speech and Language Evaluation:** A re-evaluation by a speech and language therapist could help track progress and identify areas where she still needs support.\n    *   **Occupational Therapy Evaluation:** An OT can assess her fine and gross motor skills and provide targeted interventions to address any deficits.\n*   **Be Patient and Supportive:** Continue to provide a loving and supportive environment. Celebrate her successes and offer encouragement when she struggles.\n\n**In summary, the positive changes you've witnessed are likely a combination of factors:**\n\n*   Reduction or elimination of cognitive side effects from valproic acid\n*   Improved emotional expression and regulation\n*   Potential positive impact on her ADHD and PDD-related challenges\n*   Natural developmental progress\n\nBy working closely with her medical team and providing ongoing support, you can help your daughter continue to thrive and reach her full potential.\n"

    "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand you're looking for some clarification on the EEG report while you're waiting to hear back from your neurologist.  It's completely normal to be curious and a little anxious. Let's break down what that EEG finding likely means.\n\n**\"Spike and wave discharges\"**: This refers to a specific pattern of electrical activity seen on the EEG that is considered **epileptiform**. It's a classic marker associated with seizure activity or a predisposition to seizures.  Think of it like an electrical \"blip\" or brief surge in brain activity that's not normal. It doesn't automatically mean you're having a full-blown seizure *right then*, but it indicates the brain has the potential to generate seizures.\n\n**\"Over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\"**: This tells you *where* in your brain these abnormal discharges are originating.\n\n*   **Right Hemisphere:** The activity is primarily on the right side of your brain.\n*   **Frontotemporal Region:** This area includes the frontal lobe (responsible for things like planning, decision-making, and movement) and the temporal lobe (involved in memory, language comprehension, and emotions).\n*   **Central Regions:** This refers to the area around the central sulcus, which separates the frontal and parietal lobes. It's involved in sensory and motor functions.\n*   **Maximally Frontal:** The highest concentration or strongest activity of these discharges is in the frontal lobe area on the right side.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n\nEssentially, the EEG showed that you have epileptiform activity (spike and wave discharges) originating from the right side of your brain, primarily in the frontal lobe, but also involving the temporal and central regions to some extent.\n\n**Why is this important, especially since you didn't have a seizure during the recording?**\n\n*   **Confirms the potential for seizures:** Even though you didn't have a clinical seizure during the EEG, the presence of spike and wave discharges strongly suggests that your brain is prone to generating seizures. This supports the diagnosis of a seizure disorder.\n\n*   **Helps determine the type of seizures:** The location of the epileptiform activity can help your neurologist understand what type of partial seizures you are experiencing or are likely to experience. Since it is frontotemporal, it may give an indication as to why you're occaisionally having seizures and whether the cause may be genetic, or some other reason.\n\n*   **Guides treatment decisions:** Knowing the location and type of abnormal activity is crucial for deciding on the most appropriate treatment.  This could involve medication, lifestyle adjustments, or, in some cases, further investigation.\n\n**What to expect next from your neurologist:**\n\nYour neurologist will likely discuss the following with you:\n\n*   **The significance of the EEG findings in the context of your symptoms:** They'll correlate the EEG results with the partial seizures you've been experiencing.\n*   **Diagnosis:** A clearer diagnosis of the type of seizure disorder you have.\n*   **Treatment options:** This may include anti-seizure medications (if you aren't already on them), lifestyle recommendations (sleep hygiene, stress management, avoiding triggers), and a discussion of the potential benefits and risks of each option.\n*   **Further investigations:** Depending on the situation, they might recommend additional tests like an MRI of the brain to look for any structural abnormalities that could be contributing to the seizures.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **This is just preliminary information:**  It's crucial to have a detailed discussion with your neurologist. They have the full clinical picture and can provide personalized advice.\n*   **Don't self-treat:** Do not start, stop, or change any medications without consulting your doctor.\n*   **Stay calm:** While it's understandable to be concerned, remember that many people with seizure disorders live full and active lives with proper management.\n\nIn short, the EEG results suggest that you have a tendency to have seizures coming from the right frontotemporal and central areas of your brain, especially the frontal area. It's good information for your doctor to have in order to make the best decisions about your care. A full discussion with your doctor is going to provide a much more detailed understanding of what it means for you."

    "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

    "answer": "Okay, this is a tough situation, but let's break it down and look at your options. I'm going to try to give you some concrete steps and resources.\n\n**First, Let's Address the Immediate Medical Needs & Fears:**\n\n*   **You are right to be concerned about the seizures and the cyst.** This requires proper diagnosis and ongoing management by qualified medical professionals. Don't delay seeking care, even if you're worried about the cost. Untreated seizures can lead to serious injury.\n*   **Keppra Side Effects:**  You *must* communicate these unbearable side effects to a doctor.  It's crucial to find a medication that controls the seizures with tolerable side effects. There are other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that might be a better fit for you. *Do not stop taking Keppra abruptly without talking to a doctor.*\n*   **Heart Testing:** If the ER recommended further cardiac evaluation, that's important to pursue.\n\n**Immediate Actions (Today & Monday):**\n\n1.  **211:** Call 211. This is a United Way helpline that connects you to social services. Explain your situation. They can help you find local resources for medical care, financial assistance, and legal aid. They will be more familiar with San Diego County programs.\n2.  **Hospital Financial Assistance:** Contact the billing department of the San Diego hospital where you had the ER visit *immediately*. Ask about their financial assistance program (charity care). Many hospitals have funds to help low-income patients. Explain your current income situation and the fact that you are temporarily on unemployment. Push hard for this. Ask to speak to a financial counselor at the hospital.\n3.  **Social Security Disability (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI):** *Start the application process ASAP.* It takes time. Even though you think it might be difficult to get, don't let that deter you. Apply.  Having a cyst on your brain and seizures absolutely *could* qualify you, depending on the severity and impact on your ability to function.\n    *   **SSDI:** Based on your work history.\n    *   **SSI:** Based on low income and assets. You may qualify for SSI if your unemployment runs out.\n\n**Navigating the Insurance Maze:**\n\n*   **Covered California (Obamacare/ACA):** While you are currently ineligible for subsidies, keep checking. Enrollment periods can change, and special enrollment periods may apply depending on qualifying life events (which having these medical issues may qualify). Even without a subsidy, it's worth comparing plans to see if any are more affordable than others.\n*   **Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid):** This is a state-funded program providing free or low-cost health coverage to eligible California residents. Apply again once your unemployment benefits stop.\n*   **San Diego County Health & Human Services Agency:** This is who you're calling on Monday. Be prepared to explain your situation clearly:\n    *   Temporary unemployment benefits.\n    *   Medical condition preventing you from working.\n    *   The need for ongoing medical care for seizures and a brain cyst.\n    *   Inability to afford treatment.\n    *   Ask specifically about any county-funded programs that could provide temporary medical assistance, even if it's not full insurance. They might have programs for people with specific medical conditions or those in a temporary financial crisis.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask the County Worker:**\n\n*   \"I understand my unemployment income may disqualify me from some assistance. However, my medical condition prevents me from working. Are there any programs that consider my inability to work due to medical reasons when determining eligibility?\"\n*   \"Are there any programs specifically for people with neurological conditions (like seizures or brain cysts)?\"\n*   \"Are there any programs that can help me afford medication (Keppra)?\"\n*   \"If I were to temporarily stop collecting unemployment, would that immediately make me eligible for Medi-Cal? Is there a way to pause or waive my unemployment benefits without penalty to qualify for emergency medical assistance?\" (This is a long shot, but it's worth asking.)\n*   \"What documentation do I need to provide from my doctors (both in Mexico and the US) to support my application?\"\n*   \"If I don't qualify for full Medi-Cal, are there any safety net clinics or community health centers in San Diego that offer affordable care on a sliding scale fee based on income?\"\n\n**Regarding the Advice to Go to the ER:**\n\n*   The doctor's advice to go to the ER and then expect it to be covered was terrible and unfortunately common misinformation.\n*   **Negotiate the ER Bill:** Contact the hospital billing department and explain your situation. Ask if they can reduce the bill due to your financial hardship. Many hospitals are willing to negotiate.  Mention you are applying for financial assistance.\n\n**Medicare:**\n\n*   Medicare *primarily* covers people 65 and older and those with *certain* disabilities. Usually, you have to have been receiving Social Security Disability benefits for 24 months to qualify for Medicare, regardless of age. So, if you are approved for SSDI, you'll eventually get Medicare, but there's a waiting period.\n\n**The Mexican Medical Records:**\n\n*   **Translation:** Get the medical records from Mexico translated into English by a certified translator. This will be crucial for US doctors to understand your diagnosis and treatment plan. Many hospitals or medical centers have translation services, or you can find certified translators online.\n\n**Additional Strategies:**\n\n*   **Legal Aid:** Contact a legal aid organization in San Diego County. They may be able to advise you on your rights and options for accessing healthcare.\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** Contact the Epilepsy Foundation. They may have resources or support groups in your area that can provide information and assistance.\n*   **Seek a Second Opinion:** Once you can, try to find a neurologist in the US who can review your medical records and provide a second opinion on your diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Documentation is Key:** Gather all your medical records (including the translated Mexican records), proof of income (unemployment statements), and any other relevant documents.\n*   **Be Persistent:** Navigating the healthcare system is often frustrating. Don't give up easily. Keep calling, keep asking questions, and keep advocating for yourself.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nYour priority is to get proper medical care for your seizures and brain cyst. Start the SSDI/SSI application process immediately. Contact the hospital about financial assistance. Call 211 and San Diego County Health & Human Services.  Translate your Mexican medical records. Advocate for yourself relentlessly.\n\nThis is a lot to handle, but you can do it. Take it one step at a time. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation and you're right to be concerned and confused. It's understandable that you're questioning what's going on, especially given your history. Let's break down the possibilities and what might be contributing:\n\n**Possibilities:**\n\n*   **New Seizure Type:** It's entirely possible your seizure presentation has changed. Epilepsy *can* evolve over time, even after many years. Brain surgery and strokes can alter seizure pathways, and autoimmune conditions might also play a role in seizure threshold or presentation. Difficulty breathing *can* occur during seizures, though it's more common in generalized seizures.\n*   **Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES), also known as Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These are seizure-like events that are *not* caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are often triggered by psychological or emotional stress, trauma, or underlying mental health conditions.\n*   **Combination:** It's also possible you're experiencing both epileptic seizures *and* NES, especially if stress at work is high. This is more common than you might think.\n*   **Medication Related:** It's also possible that the seizures are a side effect from one of your medications, or some kind of drug interaction.\n\n**Key Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Auras:** This is a tricky area. Auras are typically associated with epileptic seizures, representing the initial electrical discharge in a specific part of the brain. *However*, in some cases, people with NES can experience what they perceive as auras. This might be due to conditioned responses (the body associating certain feelings with an impending event), or a misinterpretation of anxiety or physical sensations.\n*   **Awareness During NES:** People's awareness during NES varies. Some are fully aware of what's happening but unable to control their movements or speech. Others may have partial awareness, or even a complete loss of awareness that mimics a typical seizure.\n*   **Post-Event Symptoms:** The milder headache you're experiencing after these episodes, compared to your typical post-ictal headache, is a point that leans *slightly* towards NES. Post-ictal states after epileptic seizures are usually quite predictable in their symptoms.\n*   **Work-Related Trigger:** The fact that these episodes are primarily occurring at work is a strong clue that stress or environmental factors at your workplace might be playing a role.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Neurologist IMMEDIATELY:** This is the most important step. You need to discuss these new episodes with your neurologist as soon as possible. Do not delay!\n2.  **Detailed Seizure Diary:** Start keeping a very detailed seizure diary. Include:\n    *   Date and time of each event\n    *   Specific symptoms experienced before, during, and after\n    *   Potential triggers (stress levels, specific tasks at work, time of day, food/drink consumed)\n    *   Medication adherence\n    *   Sleep patterns\n    *   Any other relevant details.\n3.  **Video Recording:** If possible, ask a coworker to discreetly video record one of these episodes. This can be *extremely* helpful for your neurologist in differentiating between seizure types.\n4.  **EEG Monitoring:** Your neurologist will likely want to perform another EEG. Ideally, they would try to capture one of these events on EEG to see if there's any electrical activity in the brain during the episode. If the episodes are infrequent, they might consider a longer-term ambulatory EEG or video-EEG monitoring.\n5.  **Psychological Evaluation:** Your neurologist might recommend a referral to a neuropsychologist or psychiatrist for an evaluation. This is *not* to imply that you're \"faking\" anything, but rather to explore potential psychological factors that could be contributing to NES. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with neurological patients and will be able to help in sorting out whether or not psychological factors are at play.\n6.  **Consider Workplace Factors:** Start thinking about potential stressors at work. Are there specific people, tasks, or environments that seem to trigger these episodes? Could ergonomic issues, lighting, or other environmental factors be contributing?\n7.  **Treatment:** You'll need to discuss treatment options with your neurologist based on the diagnosis. If these are epileptic seizures, medication adjustments or other treatments might be necessary. If they are NES, therapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy) is often the primary treatment.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):** APS can cause neurological complications, including seizures and stroke. It's crucial that your APS is well-managed, as this can directly impact your brain health.\n*   **Medication Interactions:** Be sure to review all your medications with your doctors (neurologist and rheumatologist) to rule out any potential interactions that might be contributing to these events.\n*   **Self-Care:** Prioritize stress management techniques, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.\n\n**In summary,** you are experiencing events that need a formal medical work-up. This could be anything from a new type of seizure to non-epileptic seizures, or both! See your neurologist as soon as you can so that you can get a proper diagnosis."

    "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's definitely possible that the anti-epileptic drugs you were taking for 14 years were having a mood-stabilizing effect, even though you were being treated for epilepsy that was later discovered to be non-epileptic seizures. Here's why:\n\n*   **Mechanism of Action Overlap:** Several anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are also used as mood stabilizers. The way they work on the brain's neurotransmitter systems can influence mood regulation. For example:\n\n    *   **Lamotrigine:** Used to treat both seizures and bipolar disorder. It affects sodium channels in the brain and is thought to help stabilize mood by preventing extreme highs and lows.\n    *   **Topiramate:** Also used for both conditions. It impacts GABA and glutamate neurotransmitter systems, potentially helping to calm overactive brain activity and stabilize mood.\n    *   **Valproate (Epilim):** A known mood stabilizer, frequently used in bipolar disorder. It affects GABA levels and other neurotransmitter systems.\n\n*   **Masking Underlying Mood Issues:** It's conceivable that you had an underlying mood disorder that was being partially managed by the AEDs, without it being recognized. When you came off the medications, this underlying condition became unmasked and more prominent.\n\n*   **Withdrawal Effects:** While generally used for withdrawal from alcohol and benzodiazepines it is thought that anti epilepsy drugs can cause withdrawal related mood fluctuations.\n\n*   **Underlying Conditions:** The fact that you have been diagnosed with PCOS and endometriosis could be contributing to your mood swings. Hormonal imbalances that are associated with these can significantly impact mood regulation.\n\nGiven your recent crisis, the fluctuating mood swings, and the history of AED use, I would *strongly* recommend the following:\n\n1.  **Consult a Psychiatrist:** A psychiatrist is the most qualified medical professional to evaluate your mood symptoms, review your medication history, and determine the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. They can assess if you have a mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder or cyclothymia (a milder form of bipolar), or another condition.\n2.  **Complete a Mood Chart:** Keeping a daily mood chart can be incredibly helpful for your psychiatrist. Note your mood each day (on a scale of 1-10), sleep patterns, energy levels, and any significant life events. This data can provide valuable insights into the pattern and severity of your mood swings.\n3.  **Consider Mood Stabilizers:** Based on the psychiatrist's assessment, mood-stabilizing medication may be recommended. There are several options available, and the choice will depend on your individual circumstances and any other medications you are taking.\n4.  **Therapy:** Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), can be highly beneficial for managing mood swings, developing coping skills, and addressing any underlying emotional issues.\n5.  **Hormone Assessment:** Given your PCOS and endometriosis diagnoses, it would be prudent to consult with an endocrinologist or your gynecologist to assess your hormone levels and determine if any hormonal imbalances are contributing to your mood instability.\n6.  **Safety Plan:** It's important to have a safety plan in place in case you experience suicidal thoughts again. This should include:\n\n    *   Identifying warning signs of a crisis.\n    *   Listing coping strategies you can use to manage difficult emotions.\n    *   Contact information for trusted friends, family members, or mental health professionals.\n    *   Resources such as crisis hotlines or mental health emergency services.\n\nIt's good that you are reflecting on your history and trying to understand your situation. Don't hesitate to seek professional help. It sounds like you have been through a lot, and getting the right support can make a significant difference in your well-being.\n"

    "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

    "answer": "Okay, that's a complex picture, and it's understandable you're seeking more insight. The persistence and impact of these headaches, layered on top of your existing neurological conditions, warrants a thorough investigation. Given your multiple specialists, it's key to try and integrate their perspectives.\n\nHere's a breakdown of possible contributing factors, questions to consider, and points to discuss with your doctors:\n\n**Key Concerns & Potential Contributing Factors:**\n\n*   **Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** This is a strong possibility given the frequency of your headaches and the use of multiple pain relievers, including ibuprofen and kratom.  Even occasional use of these can perpetuate headaches.  This is especially tricky because the \"rescue\" medications often become the problem.\n*   **Underlying Seizure Activity:** While your epilepsy is your primary focus, headache can be a manifestation of subclinical seizure activity. Some seizure types are more likely to manifest as headache. Your epileptologist is best equipped to assess this possibility.\n*   **Comorbid Migraine and Epilepsy:** Migraine and epilepsy have a known association. Even though your severe migraines have decreased, you still report headache features suggestive of migraine (throbbing, unilateral onset, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, auras). It's possible you're experiencing a lower-intensity, chronic form of migraine.\n*   **Tension-Type Headache:**  The more general, constant headache pain could be tension-type, but the presence of other features makes this less likely as a primary diagnosis. It could be contributing, however.\n*   **Cervicogenic Headache:** Pain originating from the neck (muscles, joints) can radiate to the head. The right-sided focus and neck involvement are suggestive.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** Acamprosate, Baclofen, Levitiracetam, Zonisamide, and Hydroxyzine all have potential side effects, including headache.\n*   **Kratom:**  While you find it helpful, Kratom can be a complicated drug.  It's effects are not well understood and it interacts with opioid receptors as well as other neurotransmitters. It could certainly be contributing to, or worsening, your headaches. Long-term use can also lead to withdrawal symptoms upon cessation, including headache.\n*   **Rebound Headaches from Librium:** You say you use this as needed for seizure clusters. It's possible you're getting rebound headaches as the drug wears off.\n*   **Lifestyle Factors:** While you've addressed sleep apnea and are controlling nicotine/caffeine, ensure you're also addressing stress management.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Doctors (Specifically):**\n\n*   **Medication Overuse Headache Assessment:**\n    *   \"Could my frequent use of ibuprofen and kratom be contributing to Medication Overuse Headache? What is the recommended strategy for weaning off these medications safely, considering my pain management needs?\"\n    *   \"Could the Librium be causing rebound headaches?\"\n*   **Epileptologist:**\n    *   \"Could these persistent headaches be related to my epilepsy or medication? Are there seizure types more likely to manifest as headache?\"\n    *   \"Should I consider further EEG monitoring to assess for subclinical seizure activity during headache episodes?\" (Especially if the auras coincide).\n    *   \"Do you think the auras could be the true cause of my headaches? Or can auras *cause* headaches?\"\n*   **Neurologist/Headache Specialist (ideally):**\n    *   \"Given my history of migraine, could I be experiencing a chronic, lower-intensity form of migraine now, despite the decrease in severe attacks? If so, what are the best preventive and abortive treatment options, considering my epilepsy and other medications?\"\n    *   \"What is the best way to taper off of Kratom while dealing with my headaches?\"\n    *   \"Should I consider alternative therapies like occipital nerve blocks, Botox injections (approved for chronic migraine), or physical therapy for possible cervicogenic headache?\"\n    *   \"Are there any new migraine medications that might be safe to use given my epilepsy and other conditions?\"\n    *   \"Can you help me develop a more structured approach to headache management including a daily headache diary to track frequency, intensity, triggers, and medication use?\"\n*   **All Doctors:**\n    *   \"What is the plan for coordinating my care so everyone is on the same page?\"\n    *   \"How often should I follow up to reassess my treatment plan?\"\n\n**Specific Recommendations for Discussion with Your Doctors:**\n\n1.  **Headache Diary:** Start a detailed headache diary. Record:\n    *   Date and time of headache onset\n    *   Location of pain\n    *   Intensity (scale of 1-10)\n    *   Description of pain (throbbing, pressure, etc.)\n    *   Associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, auras)\n    *   Possible triggers (stress, sleep changes, food)\n    *   Medications taken and their effectiveness\n    *   Menstrual cycle (if applicable)\n2.  **Medication Review:** A thorough review of all your medications, including OTCs and supplements, is crucial. Focus on potential interactions and side effects, especially regarding headache.\n3.  **Consider Tapering Kratom (with guidance):** Given its complex effects and the potential for it to be contributing to your headaches, discuss a safe and gradual tapering plan with your doctor.  *Do not stop Kratom abruptly without medical supervision.*\n4.  **Headache Management Plan:** Work with your doctor to develop a proactive headache management plan. This may involve:\n    *   **Preventive Medications:** Discuss options for preventive migraine medications.\n    *   **Abortive Medications:** Revisit abortive medications, especially if you suspect a migraine component.  Consider if other types of abortive medications may be of use that are not triptans.\n    *   **Non-Pharmacological Approaches:** Explore non-pharmacological options like relaxation techniques, biofeedback, acupuncture, or physical therapy.\n5.  **Cervical Spine Evaluation:** Ask about a physical exam to assess for cervical spine dysfunction.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Pulse & Blood Pressure:** A resting pulse of 40-60 is on the lower side. Be sure to mention this to your doctor, especially in the context of medications like Propranolol. The low blood pressure should also be discussed.\n*   **Nicotine:** Even infrequent nicotine use can trigger or worsen headaches in susceptible individuals.\n*   **Holistic Approach:** Remember to prioritize healthy sleep habits, regular exercise (as tolerated), and stress management.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour situation requires a coordinated approach from your healthcare team. By gathering detailed information about your headaches, discussing potential contributing factors and treatment options with your doctors, and proactively managing your health, you can hopefully find a way to reduce the frequency and severity of your headaches and improve your quality of life. Good luck!\n"

I would be using every form of PPE available to me as wellAge 23, height 511, weight 180 complaint 2 years Male good health, no smoking and rare drinking , about 2 years",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is definitely not an odd question, and it's a very important one to consider carefully. Since you're asking about a potentially hazardous activity after a possible seizure event, I need to be very clear: **I cannot give you medical advice. This information is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. You *must* discuss this with your neurologist or doctor before engaging in welding.**\n\nHere's why and what you need to discuss with your doctor:\n\n*   **Seizure Control and Welding Hazards:** Welding involves inherent risks:\n    *   **Electrical Shock:** The most immediate danger. A seizure during a shock could be fatal.\n    *   **Burns:** From the arc, spatter, and hot materials. Loss of consciousness during a seizure near hot materials is extremely dangerous.\n    *   **Fires/Explosions:** Welding can ignite flammable materials.\n    *   **Fumes and Gases:** Inhalation can trigger health problems or exacerbate underlying conditions.\n    *   **Falls:** Working at heights, in awkward positions, or near edges increases the risk of injury during a seizure.\n    *   **Eye Damage:** The welding arc is extremely damaging to the eyes if not properly protected.\n\n*   **Your Specific Medical History:** Your doctor needs to consider:\n    *   **Diagnosis:** Was the previous event definitely a seizure? What kind?\n    *   **Seizure Control:** How well are your medications working? Have you had any breakthrough events?\n    *   **Triggers:** Are there any known triggers for your seizures that might be present in a welding environment (e.g., flashing lights, stress, lack of sleep, certain fumes)?\n    *   **Aura:** Do you experience an aura or warning signs before a seizure? This could give you time to stop welding and get to a safe place.\n\n*   **Welding Environment and Safety Protocols:** You need to discuss with your doctor the specifics of where you'd be welding. Important factors include:\n    *   **Supervision:** Will you be working alone or with someone who knows your medical history and can assist you if needed? This is *crucial*.\n    *   **Emergency Plan:** Is there a clear plan in place for what to do if you have a seizure while welding? This includes immediate shut-off of equipment and calling for medical help.\n    *   **Work Environment:** Is it well-ventilated? Are there trip hazards? Are there flammable materials nearby?\n    *   **Type of Welding:** Certain types of welding (e.g., underwater welding) are inherently more dangerous.\n    *   **PPE:** While PPE is essential, it won't prevent all injuries during a seizure.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"Given my medical history and seizure control, is it safe for me to engage in welding?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific precautions I should take to minimize the risk of injury?\"\n*   \"What are the signs that I should stop welding immediately?\"\n*   \"Would it be helpful for the people I work with to know about my medical history?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific types of welding or welding environments that are more dangerous for me?\"\n*   \"Are there any resources for people with epilepsy or seizure disorders who work in potentially hazardous occupations?\"\n\n**In summary: Your doctor is the *only* person who can give you a reliable answer. Do not attempt to weld until you have had a thorough discussion with your physician.**\n"

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This sounds like a very distressing and unusual experience. While I cannot provide a diagnosis, I can offer some information that might be helpful, and strongly recommend you consult with a medical professional.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential aspects and why seeking professional help is crucial:\n\n**Possible Explanations & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Sleep Paralysis (SP):** Your description shares some characteristics with typical sleep paralysis, such as the feeling of being paralyzed. However, the \"rattling brain,\" \"hurricane,\" and \"magnet\" sensations are atypical and require further investigation. SP typically involves being aware of your surroundings, seeing things (hallucinations), and feeling a sense of dread or pressure.\n*   **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** These hallucinations occur as you're falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic). They can be visual, auditory, or tactile (feeling sensations). The \"whooshing\" feeling and the imagined magnet could be a form of tactile hallucination. The feeling of your hand not moving could be the hallucination.\n*   **Exploding Head Syndrome:** This is a benign (not dangerous) but frightening condition where people hear loud noises (explosions, crashes, etc.) just as they're falling asleep or waking up. While the sounds you describe don't sound exactly like explosions, the \"rattling\" and sense of something about to \"explode\" could potentially be related.\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** Migraines can sometimes present with unusual neurological symptoms, including sensory disturbances, which could explain some of what you're experiencing.\n*   **Anxiety & Stress:** Significant anxiety and stress can manifest in unusual physical and mental sensations. While this doesn't rule out other possibilities, it's important to consider stress as a contributing factor.\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:** It's essential to rule out other, less common, neurological conditions that might be causing these sensations.\n*   **Psychological Factors:** It's important to also consider that what you are experiencing could be related to psychological factors or an underlying mental health condition.\n\n**Why You NEED to See a Doctor:**\n\n*   **Rule Out Medical Causes:** The first step is to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be responsible for your symptoms. A doctor can perform a physical exam, review your medical history, and order any necessary tests (e.g., brain imaging, EEG) to assess your neurological function.\n*   **Proper Diagnosis:** A correct diagnosis is essential for receiving appropriate treatment and managing your condition effectively.\n*   **Treatment Options:** Depending on the cause of your symptoms, treatment options may include medication, therapy, lifestyle changes, or other interventions.\n*   **Peace of Mind:** Knowing the cause of your symptoms and having a plan for managing them can significantly reduce your anxiety and improve your quality of life.\n*   **Safety:** Some neurological conditions can have serious consequences if left untreated.\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctor:**\n\nBe as detailed and descriptive as possible when explaining your symptoms. Consider keeping a sleep diary to track when these episodes occur, what you experience during them, and any potential triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, etc.).\n\n*   **Specific Sensations:** Describe the \"rattling,\" \"hurricane,\" \"magnet,\" and \"whooshing\" sensations in detail.\n*   **Timing:** Note when these episodes occur (falling asleep, waking up, during the night).\n*   **Frequency:** How often are you experiencing these episodes?\n*   **Duration:** How long do the episodes last?\n*   **Triggers:** Are there any potential triggers you've identified (e.g., stress, sleep deprivation, specific sleeping positions)?\n*   **Other Symptoms:** Mention any other symptoms you're experiencing, such as anxiety, depression, headaches, or visual disturbances.\n*   **Medical History:** Provide your doctor with your complete medical history, including any medications you're taking, any past medical conditions, and any family history of neurological or sleep disorders.\n\n**Do not delay seeking medical attention. These symptoms are unusual and warrant a thorough medical evaluation.**\n"

I\u2019ve been having seizure like things for about 4 months, the Dr\u2019s are confused by the full list of the symptoms, but believe they are seizures. It started with dizziness 6 months ago. So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG\u2019s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I\u2019m scared.. I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back.

If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I\u2019m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn\u2019t have any \u201cepisodes\u201d yesterday, but couldn\u2019t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I\u2019m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr\u2019s that they might not be considering as an option.",

    "answer": "Okay, Marina, it's completely understandable that you're scared. What you're experiencing is disruptive and the uncertainty makes it even worse, especially as a new mom. Let's break down what to expect, potential next steps, and some things you can consider.\n\n**What to Expect During the Long-Term EEG Monitoring (LTM)**\n\n*   **Purpose:** The goal of this prolonged EEG is to capture one or more of your events while they are recording your brain activity. This is crucial because short EEGs often miss intermittent events.\n*   **The Process:**\n    *   **Arrival and Setup:** You'll be admitted to the hospital or a specialized epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). They will thoroughly explain the procedure, answer your questions, and get consent. Electrodes (small, metal discs) will be glued to your scalp. This isn't painful, but the glue can be a little messy.\n    *   **Video Monitoring:** You will be video recorded 24/7 to correlate your symptoms with the EEG readings.\n    *   **Monitoring:** A technician will be watching the EEG and the video, and nursing staff will check in on you regularly. They'll ask about any sensations you're having.\n    *   **Medication Adjustments (Possibly):** They may gradually reduce or even stop your anti-seizure medication (if you were on one) under close supervision. This increases the chance of capturing an event if it is truly a seizure. *This is ONLY if you are on anti-seizure medication.*\n    *   **Provocation (Possibly):** If you don't have an event spontaneously, they might try to trigger one with sleep deprivation or hyperventilation (deep, rapid breathing).\n    *   **Duration:** Expect to be there for 3-5 days, or sometimes even longer, depending on how quickly they capture an event.\n*   **What to Bring:**\n    *   Comfortable clothes (hospital gowns can be uncomfortable)\n    *   Personal toiletries\n    *   Books, magazines, or other quiet activities to pass the time\n    *   Laptop or tablet (check if the facility has Wi-Fi)\n    *   A list of your symptoms, triggers, and any questions you have for the doctors\n\n**What Happens if Epilepsy is Ruled Out?**\n\nIf the EEG shows no epileptic activity during your events, that's significant, and it means they need to explore other possibilities. Here's what might happen next:\n\n*   **Detailed Neurological Exam:** A very thorough assessment of your reflexes, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognitive function.\n*   **Further Imaging:** An MRI of the brain is often ordered (if not already done) to look for structural abnormalities that might not be related to epilepsy. Sometimes other specialized MRI techniques are used.\n*   **Cardiac Evaluation:** Given the dizziness and loss of consciousness, a cardiac workup is important to rule out heart-related causes like arrhythmias or vasovagal syncope. This might involve an EKG (electrocardiogram), Holter monitor (continuous EKG recording), or an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).\n*   **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Given your history of depression and anxiety, and the nature of your symptoms, a thorough psychiatric evaluation is essential. Some conditions can mimic seizures.\n*   **Psychological Testing:** Formal neuropsychological testing can assess your cognitive function (memory, attention, language) in more detail to help identify any specific areas of concern and guide treatment.\n\n**Other Possible Diagnoses to Consider (That You Can Discuss With Your Doctors):**\n\n*   **Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES) / Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a very real condition where someone has seizure-like events that are *not* caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It's a problem with how the brain is functioning, and it can be triggered by stress, trauma, or underlying psychological factors. It is important to realize, that it does not mean the symptoms aren\u2019t real.\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Some types of migraines can cause dizziness, visual disturbances, and even temporary weakness or loss of consciousness.\n*   **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** This is a condition affecting blood flow, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, especially when standing up. The \"elevator\" feeling you describe could be related.\n*   **Vestibular Disorders:** Problems with the inner ear can cause dizziness, vertigo, and balance problems.\n*   **Autoimmune Disorders:** In rare cases, autoimmune conditions can affect the brain and nervous system, causing a variety of neurological symptoms.\n*   **Conversion Disorder:** While less common, this involves neurological symptoms (like weakness, paralysis, or sensory loss) that are thought to be caused by psychological distress.\n*   **Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia:** This rare condition causes brief, involuntary movements triggered by sudden movements. It can sometimes be mistaken for seizures.\n\n**Things to Bring Up With Your Doctors:**\n\n*   **Detailed Description of Your Symptoms:** Be as specific as possible about what you feel *before*, *during*, and *after* each event. The \"elevator\" feeling is a key detail.\n*   **Triggers:** Are there any specific situations, activities, or emotional states that seem to trigger your events?\n*   **Frequency and Timing:** Keep a log of when your events occur, how long they last, and what you were doing beforehand.\n*   **Impact on Daily Life:** Explain how these events are affecting your ability to care for your baby, work, and maintain your overall quality of life.\n*   **Postpartum Considerations:** Remind them that you are 9 months postpartum. Hormonal changes after pregnancy can sometimes trigger or worsen neurological symptoms.\n*   **Ask About NES/FND:** Directly ask if they are considering Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES) or Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). If they are, ask what their plan is for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Tips for Passing the Time During the LTM:**\n\n*   **Books, Magazines, Audiobooks, and Podcasts:** Immerse yourself in a good story or learn something new.\n*   **Laptop/Tablet:** Watch movies, TV shows, or browse the internet (if Wi-Fi is available).\n*   **Creative Activities:** Bring a sketchbook, journal, or knitting needles.\n*   **Connect with Loved Ones:** Use your phone to call or video chat with family and friends.\n*   **Relaxation Techniques:** Practice meditation, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't be afraid to ask questions and express your concerns. You are the expert on your own experience.\n*   **Get a Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting, seek a second opinion from another neurologist or specialist.\n*   **Find Support:** Connect with other people who are experiencing similar symptoms. Online support groups and forums can be a valuable source of information and emotional support.\n*   **Therapy:** Regardless of the final diagnosis, therapy (especially cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT) can be helpful in managing your symptoms, coping with stress, and improving your overall well-being. This is especially true if NES/FND is considered.\n*   **Remember You're Not Alone:** Many people experience unexplained neurological symptoms. It can take time to find the right diagnosis and treatment, but don't give up hope.\n\n**To summarize:**\n\n*   The prolonged EEG monitoring is crucial to get a good look at what is happening during one of these events.\n*   If epilepsy is ruled out, there are many other possible diagnoses that need to be considered. It could be heart problems, or another neurological issue. Or it could also be Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES) or Functional Neurological Disorder (FND).\n*   Do advocate for yourself. Do ask questions. Do get a second opinion if you are not happy with the way things are going. And do remember that you are not alone.\n\nIt's brave of you to seek information and advocate for your health. I hope this information helps you feel more prepared and empowered.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

    "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",

    "answer": "It's understandable that you're struggling and looking for clarity on the root cause of your difficulties. You have a complex medical history, and sorting out the contributions of childhood epilepsy, potential traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and medication side effects is challenging. Let's break down each factor and who might be best suited to help:\n\n**1. Epilepsy:**\n\n*   **Likelihood of Being \"In the Clear\":** A normal EEG after many years without seizures is a very positive sign. However, it doesn't guarantee that you're completely clear of any long-term cognitive or emotional consequences.\n*   **Potential Long-Term Consequences:** While your seizures were well-managed, the sheer volume of seizures you experienced as an infant and young child *could* have contributed to cognitive and emotional difficulties.  Even well-controlled epilepsy, especially when starting at a very young age, can impact brain development and function. Some potential consequences can include memory issues, difficulty with executive function (planning, organization, and decision-making), mood changes, and anxiety.\n*   **Who Can Help:** **A neurologist with expertise in epilepsy and cognitive/behavioral outcomes** is the best starting point. They can:\n    *   Review your entire seizure history, including your early EEGs and seizure types.\n    *   Assess the likelihood of any ongoing subtle epileptic activity or long-term effects.\n    *   Order further testing if necessary (e.g., neuropsychological testing).\n    *   Adjust your Adderall if they believe it may be exacerbating any cognitive or emotional symptoms.\n*   **Important Note:**  Even though your EEG is normal, it's crucial to rule out any subtle seizure activity or long-term effects from the early epilepsy.\n\n**2. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) from Riding Accident:**\n\n*   **Potential Impact:** Even a brief loss of consciousness with a cracked helmet can cause a concussion or mild TBI. The effects can sometimes be subtle but long-lasting.  Symptoms can overlap with PTSD and seizure-related issues, including headaches, fatigue, cognitive difficulties (memory, concentration), mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression), and sleep disturbances.\n*   **Who Can Help:** A neurologist can assess for potential long-term effects of the TBI. Neuropsychological testing would be very helpful in this situation.\n\n**3. PTSD:**\n\n*   **Potential Impact:** PTSD can have a profound impact on cognitive function, mood, and overall well-being. Concentration difficulties, memory problems, anxiety, depression, and fatigue are all common PTSD symptoms.\n*   **Stellate Ganglion Block:** This is a treatment primarily for PTSD. It involves injecting a local anesthetic near the stellate ganglion nerve in the neck, which can help regulate the \"fight-or-flight\" response.  It's a promising treatment, but it's essential to determine if PTSD is the primary driver of your symptoms before pursuing it.\n*   **Who Can Help:** You're already seeing a therapist (LCSW), which is excellent. They can continue to provide therapy to address the PTSD. The **pain center** that offers stellate ganglion blocks will likely require a thorough evaluation to determine if you're a suitable candidate. They might also want documentation from your therapist regarding your PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity.\n\n**4. Adderall:**\n\n*   **Potential Impact:** Adderall is a stimulant and can affect mood, anxiety, sleep, and appetite. While it can improve concentration for some, it can also worsen anxiety and lead to irritability or insomnia in others. These side effects can mimic or exacerbate the symptoms you're already experiencing.\n*   **Who Can Help:** Your neurologist or primary care physician can adjust your Adderall dosage or explore alternative medications if they believe it's contributing to your symptoms.\n\n**5. Neuropsychological Testing:**\n\n*   **Why It's Important:** This is a crucial tool to help differentiate between the various potential causes of your difficulties. A neuropsychological evaluation can provide a detailed assessment of your cognitive strengths and weaknesses, including memory, attention, executive function, language, and visual-spatial skills. The results can help determine:\n    *   Whether there are cognitive deficits consistent with long-term effects of epilepsy or TBI.\n    *   The extent to which PTSD is affecting your cognitive function.\n    *   Whether there are patterns of cognitive impairment that might suggest other underlying conditions.\n*   **Who to Contact:** A **neuropsychologist**. They are specially trained to administer and interpret neuropsychological tests.\n\n**Recommended Steps:**\n\n1.  **Consult with a Neurologist:** Start with a neurologist who has expertise in epilepsy and cognitive/behavioral outcomes. This is the most crucial step, as they can assess your epilepsy history, order an EEG if needed (though your recent normal one is reassuring), and consider the potential long-term effects of seizures and your TBI. Explain all of your symptoms, including the concentration issues, fatigue, memory problems, anxiety, and depression.\n2.  **Neuropsychological Evaluation:**  Discuss neuropsychological testing with your neurologist or therapist. They can recommend a qualified neuropsychologist. While it might seem like an added expense, the information gained from this testing can be invaluable in guiding your treatment plan.\n3.  **Evaluate Adderall:** Discuss the pros and cons of your Adderall prescription with your neurologist. They might recommend reducing the dose or changing the medication.\n4.  **Consider Stellate Ganglion Block:** If PTSD seems to be the dominant factor after the neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, then explore stellate ganglion block further. Get a referral to the pain center that performs the procedure and have a thorough evaluation to ensure you're a suitable candidate.\n5.  **Communicate with Your Therapist:** Keep your therapist informed about your medical evaluations and any treatment plans. Therapy can be very helpful in managing the emotional and behavioral aspects of your condition, regardless of the underlying cause.\n\n**Prioritization and Cost Considerations:**\n\n*   **Neurologist Consultation:** This is the most important first step.\n*   **Neuropsychological Testing:** While an expense, it's very valuable for clarifying the underlying causes of your symptoms. Consider checking with your insurance company to see how much they will cover. Some neuropsychologists offer a sliding scale fee or payment plans.\n*   **Stellate Ganglion Block:** This should be considered *after* you have a clearer understanding of the role of PTSD in your symptoms and after you've had a neurological evaluation.\n\n**In summary, seeing a neurologist with expertise in epilepsy and cognitive/behavioral outcomes is the best place to start. They can assess your seizure history, order neuropsychological testing, and help determine the best course of action.** This structured approach will give you the best chance of understanding the root cause of your difficulties and developing an effective treatment plan. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question.My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures.My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic EpilepsyDrugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 1000mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed.Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're concerned about the potential interaction between your epilepsy medications and HRT, especially given your history of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy and its specific triggers. This is a complex issue, and it's great that you're being proactive about researching it.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the potential interactions, things to consider, and why consulting your doctors is essential:**\n\n**Understanding Potential Interactions**\n\n*   **How HRT (Estrogen and Testosterone) Might Affect Seizures:** Sex hormones can influence seizure activity. Estrogen, in some cases, can be pro-convulsant (increase seizure risk), while progesterone (depending on the specific type) might have some anticonvulsant properties. Testosterone's effect is less well-defined and may depend on the individual. The balance between estrogen and progesterone is often important.\n*   **How HRT Might Affect AED Levels:** Some HRT formulations could potentially affect the metabolism (breakdown) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the liver. If this happens, it could alter the blood levels of your Depakote and Keppra, either increasing or decreasing their effectiveness.\n*   **Specific AED Interactions:**\n    *   **Depakote (Valproate):** Valproate is metabolized in the liver. While significant interactions with HRT are not as widely reported as with some other AEDs (like certain enzyme-inducing AEDs), it's still possible that HRT could influence its metabolism to some degree. Valproate also carries a risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women, which is relevant to consider, though not directly applicable to your specific transition.\n    *   **Keppra (Levetiracetam):** Keppra generally has fewer drug interactions than many other AEDs. It is primarily cleared by the kidneys. However, it's still important to be aware that any change in liver or kidney function (which *could* be influenced by hormonal changes) *could* theoretically affect its clearance.\n\n**Factors to Consider**\n\n*   **Type and Dosage of HRT:** The specific type of estrogen and/or anti-androgen used in HRT will affect the potential interactions. Dosages also play a role.\n*   **Individual Variability:** People respond differently to both AEDs and HRT. What happens in one person might not happen in another.\n*   **Your Specific Seizure Type and Control:** The better controlled your seizures are before starting HRT, the easier it will be to monitor for any changes.\n\n**Why Consulting Your Doctors Is CRUCIAL**\n\n1.  **Neurologist:** You *must* discuss your plans to start HRT with your neurologist. They are the expert on your epilepsy and AEDs. They can:\n    *   Assess your current seizure control and risk factors.\n    *   Monitor your AED levels more frequently when you start HRT.\n    *   Adjust your AED dosages if needed.\n    *   Provide guidance on potential interactions.\n    *   Help you create a seizure action plan.\n2.  **Endocrinologist (or Doctor Prescribing HRT):** The doctor prescribing your HRT needs to be aware of your epilepsy and medications. They can:\n    *   Choose HRT formulations that are less likely to interact with your AEDs (if such options exist).\n    *   Monitor your hormone levels closely.\n    *   Coordinate care with your neurologist.\n3.  **Primary Care Physician (PCP):** Your PCP should also be informed, so they can have a complete picture of your health and medications.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1.  **Schedule Appointments:** Make appointments with your neurologist and the doctor who will be prescribing your HRT *before* you start HRT.\n2.  **Be Open and Honest:** Tell each doctor about all your medications (including supplements), your seizure history, and your concerns about interactions.\n3.  **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask questions! For example:\n    *   \"What are the potential interactions between [specific HRT medication] and Depakote/Keppra?\"\n    *   \"How will you monitor my AED levels and seizure control?\"\n    *   \"What are the warning signs that my seizures are becoming worse?\"\n    *   \"What is the plan if my seizures increase?\"\n4.  **Keep a Seizure Diary:** Track your seizures (if you have them), any aura symptoms, and any other changes you notice in your health. This information will be helpful for your doctors.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Withdrawal from AEDs is almost always not recommended.**\n*   **Don't stop taking your epilepsy medications without talking to your neurologist.** Abruptly stopping AEDs can lead to serious problems, including status epilepticus (prolonged seizures).\n*   **Be patient.** It may take some time to find the right HRT regimen and AED adjustments to optimize your seizure control and overall health.\n*   **Prioritize Sleep:** You mentioned sleep deprivation as a trigger. Maintain consistent sleep habits, especially during the transition period.\n*   **Manage Stress:** Stress and anxiety can also trigger seizures. Explore stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or yoga.\n\n**In summary, while Depakote and Keppra may not have as many well-documented interactions with HRT as some other AEDs, potential interactions are still possible. It is imperative that you discuss your plans with your neurologist and the doctor prescribing your HRT to ensure your safety and well-being.** They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.*\n"

    "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're going through a very difficult time and are feeling frustrated and scared. It's completely valid to feel this way when you're experiencing these debilitating episodes, especially when your doctor seems dismissive due to normal EEG results. Let's break down your concerns and explore potential avenues for you to discuss with your doctor or seek further opinion.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the key concerns and possible next steps:**\n\n*   **Worsening Symptoms Despite Medication:** This is the most pressing issue. The fact that your \"episodes\" are happening more frequently and lasting longer despite being on both Medotrigin (Lamotrigine) and Timonil retard (Carbamazepine) is a strong indicator that your current treatment plan isn't effectively controlling your symptoms.\n*   **Feeling Disconnected/Dream-like:** The description of your world appearing \"like in a movie or dream,\" the slowed perception, and the difficulty reacting suggests a phenomenon known as **derealization** and/or **depersonalization**. These are symptoms where you feel detached from reality or yourself. While these can occur with some types of seizures, they are also symptoms of anxiety disorders, depression, and other neurological or psychological conditions.\n*   **Sensitivity to Light and Noise:** This is common in migraine, certain seizure types, and other neurological conditions. It also can occur with anxiety or other sensory processing issues.\n*   **Memory Problems:**  The memory gaps you describe could be related to the seizures themselves, or side effects of the medication, or even anxiety or depression.\n*   **Doctor's Dismissal:** This is a major barrier to getting appropriate care. It's understandable that you feel disbelieved when your EEGs are normal, but your lived experience is incredibly important and deserves serious consideration.\n*   **Depression:**  This is a natural consequence of dealing with chronic, debilitating symptoms. It is essential to address this as well.\n\n**Possible Explanations and Things to Discuss with your Doctor:**\n\n1.  **Medication Adjustment/Change:**\n    *   **Dosage:** It's possible your current dosages of Medotrigin and Timonil retard are insufficient to control your seizures, especially with the worsening symptoms.\n    *   **Combination:** Sometimes, certain medications don't work well together. While this is not always the case with your current medication, you could discuss if trying different medications would be a better option.\n    *   **Resistance:** You could be developing a tolerance or resistance to the current medications. Another anti-epileptic drug (AED) or combination of AEDs might be more effective.\n2.  **Seizure Type Re-evaluation:**\n    *   **Absence Seizures vs. Other Types:**  It's crucial to confirm that your \"episodes\" are truly absence seizures.  The symptoms you describe, especially the derealization/depersonalization, might suggest complex partial seizures or other seizure types.\n    *   **Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** This is important to consider if EEGs are consistently normal *during* your events. PNES (also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) look like epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are a manifestation of psychological distress. These are very common and very real and can be treated through psychological intervention.\n3.  **Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Migraine with Aura:** Your symptoms could be related to migraine variants, especially if the episodes involve visual disturbances, altered perception, and fatigue.\n    *   **Anxiety Disorders/Panic Disorder:**  Panic attacks can sometimes present with derealization, depersonalization, and a sense of unreality.\n    *   **Dissociative Disorders:** These involve disruptions in awareness, memory, identity, and perception.\n    *   **Other Neurological Conditions:**  Less common, but it's worth considering if other neurological issues could be contributing to your symptoms.\n4.  **Importance of Capturing an Event on EEG:**\n    *   **Ambulatory EEG:** A longer EEG recording (e.g., 24-72 hours) worn at home increases the chance of capturing an event and providing valuable diagnostic information.\n    *   **Video EEG Monitoring:** If ambulatory EEG is not revealing, inpatient video EEG monitoring in a hospital setting can be more sensitive. This allows for continuous EEG and video recording, which can be crucial to capture your events and correlate them with brain activity.\n5.  **Address Depression and Anxiety:**\n    *   **Therapy:** A therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms, manage anxiety, and address any underlying emotional issues.\n    *   **Medication:** Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be beneficial in managing these symptoms.\n\n**Action Plan & What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Document Your Episodes:** Keep a detailed diary of your episodes, including:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   Duration\n    *   Specific symptoms (be as descriptive as possible about the \"movie-like\" feeling, sensory sensitivities, etc.)\n    *   Possible triggers (light, noise, stress, sleep deprivation, etc.)\n    *   Medication taken and timing\n    *   Impact on your daily life\n2.  **Prepare for Your Next Doctor's Appointment:**\n    *   **Bring your seizure diary.**\n    *   **Clearly explain the impact on your life.** Don't downplay your symptoms.  Use specific examples. \"I'm unable to work because I have these episodes almost every day.  I'm afraid to leave the house.\"\n    *   **Be assertive.**  You deserve to be heard and taken seriously.\n    *   **Ask specific questions:**\n        *   \"Could my symptoms be related to something other than absence seizures?\"\n        *   \"Could we try a different medication or adjust my current dosages?\"\n        *   \"Is it possible to get a longer EEG recording to capture an event?\"\n        *   \"Could you refer me to a neurologist with expertise in complex epilepsy cases?\"\n        *   \"I am struggling with depression and anxiety. Can you recommend a therapist or psychiatrist?\"\n3.  **Seek a Second Opinion:** If you continue to feel dismissed by your current doctor, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist, preferably one with expertise in epilepsy or complex neurological disorders. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself.\n4.  **Consider Therapy:**  Regardless of the cause of your episodes, therapy can provide valuable support and coping strategies.\n5.  **Support Groups:**  Consider joining an epilepsy support group. Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Never stop taking your medication abruptly.** This can be dangerous and can trigger more seizures. Always consult with your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.\n*   **Driving:** Your ability to drive may be affected by your seizures. Discuss this with your doctor.\n\nIt's important to remember that you are not alone, and there are options available to help you manage your condition and improve your quality of life. Don't give up on finding answers and getting the care you deserve. Persistence and advocacy are key.\n"

I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",

    "answer": "Okay, I understand your frustration. It's incredibly disheartening to feel like your concerns aren't being fully addressed, especially when dealing with a recurring and disruptive condition like this.  Let's break down your situation and explore potential avenues to discuss with your doctors.\n\n**Key Concerns and Observations:**\n\n*   **Documented Heart Pauses:** The 5-13 second pauses recorded by your loop recorder are significant and definitely warrant attention.\n*   **Lack of Trigger:** You're right to question the \"vasovagal syncope\" diagnosis if no clear trigger is identified, especially given the increasing frequency and positional independence of the episodes.\n*   **Prodrome/Aura:** The deja vu and surreal feeling are crucial details that strongly suggest a neurological component. This \"aura\" or \"warning\" could be the start of a seizure.\n*   **Post-Episode Symptoms:** Foggy headedness, short-term memory issues, coldness, and digestive issues after the episodes further support a more complex picture than simple vasovagal syncope.\n*   **Increasing Frequency and Severity:** The worsening frequency and the impact on your memory are worrying signs.\n*   **Hormonal Link:** The correlation with your menstrual cycle is a significant clue that needs to be investigated.\n*   **Ineffectiveness of Standard Vasovagal Management:** The fact that increased water intake and regular movement aren't helping strongly suggests the underlying cause is not primarily vasovagal in nature.\n*  **Pacemaker recommendation**: In some situations a pacemaker may be required, even if your symptoms are caused by something else (e.g. epilepsy). A pacemaker may be suggested if the pauses are long or if the pauses are suspected to contribute to the fall risks.\n\n**Possible Explanations and Questions for Your Doctors:**\n\nGiven your detailed description, here are some possibilities to consider and discuss with your neurologist and cardiologist:\n\n1.  **Cardiac vs. Neurological \u2013 A Complex Interplay:**\n\n    *   The loop recorder confirms the pauses, making the cardiac aspect undeniable. However, the pre- and post-episode symptoms, especially the deja vu, point strongly towards a neurological trigger _causing_ the cardiac pauses.\n    *   **Question:** Is it possible that a seizure-like event is triggering a vagal response, leading to the heart slowing and pausing? (See point 3 about temporal lobe epilepsy)\n\n2.  **Vasovagal Syncope \u2013 Atypical Presentation:**\n\n    *   While unlikely given your description, it's essential to rule out all variations of vasovagal syncope.\n    *   **Question:** Is it possible I have a rare form of vasovagal syncope that doesn't respond to typical management?\n    *   **Consider:** Tilt-table testing to further evaluate vasovagal response, although given your loop recorder findings, this might not be as informative.\n\n3.  **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):**\n\n    *   This is a very strong possibility, given your deja vu, surreal feelings, post-episode confusion, and memory problems. TLE seizures can present with unusual symptoms, including cardiac manifestations.\n    *   **Question:** Could I be experiencing temporal lobe seizures that are triggering the heart pauses?\n    *   **Key Point:** Sinus pauses are *atypical* but *possible* in epilepsy. Some research suggests that seizure activity can directly affect the vagus nerve or other brain regions controlling heart rhythm.\n    *   **Diagnostic Tests:**\n        *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  This measures brain activity and can help detect seizure activity.  A routine EEG might not capture events if they are infrequent, so consider asking about:\n            *   **Prolonged EEG Monitoring:**  Staying in the hospital for a few days with continuous EEG recording increases the chance of capturing an event.\n            *   **Ambulatory EEG:** Wearing an EEG monitor at home for several days.\n            *   **Sleep-deprived EEG:**  Sleep deprivation can sometimes trigger seizure activity and make it easier to detect on an EEG.\n        *   **MRI of the Brain:**  This can help identify any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as hippocampal sclerosis, which is sometimes associated with TLE.\n\n4.  **Hormonal Influence (Catamenial Epilepsy):**\n\n    *   The correlation with your menstrual cycle strongly suggests a hormonal influence.\n    *   **Question:** Could my symptoms be related to hormonal fluctuations during my menstrual cycle (catamenial epilepsy)?\n    *   **Consider:**\n        *   **Tracking your symptoms:** Keep a detailed log of your episodes, including the date of your menstrual cycle and any other relevant factors (stress levels, sleep patterns, etc.).\n        *   **Hormone testing:**  Discuss hormone level testing with your doctor to see if there are any abnormalities.\n        *   **Possible treatment:** If a hormonal link is confirmed, hormonal therapies or seizure medications that are less affected by hormonal fluctuations might be considered.\n\n5.  **Autonomic Dysfunction:**\n\n    *   Autonomic dysfunction refers to a problem with the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. While vasovagal syncope *is* a type of autonomic dysfunction, your symptoms suggest it might be more complex.\n    *   **Question:** Could I have a more general form of autonomic dysfunction that is contributing to my symptoms?\n    *   **Consider:**\n        *   **Autonomic testing:** This can assess the function of your autonomic nervous system.\n\n6.  **Medication Side Effects:**\n\n    *   Review all medications and supplements you are taking with your doctor to rule out any potential contributions.\n\n**Steps to Take Before Your Neurology Appointment:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Keep a meticulous record of your episodes. Include:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   What you were doing immediately before\n    *   Your position (sitting, standing, lying down)\n    *   What you ate and drank in the hours before\n    *   Details of the aura/warning signs\n    *   The exact sequence of events during the episode\n    *   All post-episode symptoms and their duration\n    *   Your menstrual cycle dates\n    *   Stress levels\n\n2.  **List of Questions:** Prepare a list of specific questions for your neurologist and cardiologist, including the ones I suggested above.\n\n3.  **Gather Medical Records:**  Make sure your neurologist has access to all your previous cardiac reports, loop recorder data, and any other relevant medical information.\n\n4.  **Bring a Support Person:**  Having someone with you at your appointments can help you remember information and advocate for your concerns.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't be afraid to push for further investigation and express your concerns if you feel you're not being heard.\n*   **Seek a Second Opinion:** If you continue to feel that your doctors aren't adequately addressing your concerns, consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist and/or cardiologist who specialize in syncope and epilepsy.\n*   **Safety Precautions:** Until you have a better understanding of what's causing your episodes, take precautions to prevent injury during falls. This might include avoiding activities where a fall could be dangerous (e.g., climbing ladders) and being aware of your surroundings.\n\n**In the meantime, focus on:**\n\n*   **Stress management:** Continue with your meditation, exercise, and counseling.\n*   **Good sleep hygiene:** Aim for consistent sleep patterns.\n*   **Healthy diet:** Maintain a balanced diet and stay hydrated.\n*   **Avoid potential triggers:** If you notice any specific patterns or triggers, try to avoid them.\n\nIt's crucial to have an open and honest dialogue with your doctors, sharing your concerns and actively participating in the diagnostic process. This is a complex situation, but with thorough investigation and careful consideration, you can hopefully get to the bottom of it and find a treatment plan that improves your quality of life. Good luck, and please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

    "question": " Female, 20, 5\"7\", 250lbs, CaucasianNo drug use, no current medication,For the past 6 years I've been having what I think is sleep paralysis fits, the symptoms are like this:I have a weird feeling before sleeping, I can't describe it but when i feel it i know i'm gonna fall into sleep paralysis. then I can't move anything, i'm aware of of my surroundings, scary ominous aura, and sometimes theres this loud ringing, like so loud I feel it in my head pulsing, then pain in my body like fingers being pushed in my sides, and even i sometimes feel my body...buzzing? or shaking fast i dont know if its happening IRL or just in my sleep, or a part of my brain feels like electricity, its usually painful, but there was one time it felt...kinda not bad...like a brain massage, then it went down my back. I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

    "answer": "Okay, that sounds like a really distressing experience, and it's understandable that you're worried, especially with the \"brain electric feeling.\" Let's break down your symptoms and consider some possibilities, keeping in mind that I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This information is for educational purposes and does not substitute for professional medical advice. You absolutely need to see a doctor when you are able to.\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms**\n\nYou've described a constellation of symptoms that point towards a potential issue that should be discussed with a doctor. Let's categorize them:\n\n*   **Classic Sleep Paralysis Features:**\n    *   Inability to move during sleep onset or awakening.\n    *   Awareness of surroundings.\n    *   Sense of ominous presence or fear.\n    *   Auditory hallucinations (ringing, growling, whistling).\n    *   Visual hallucinations (floating, seeing from a different perspective).\n*   **Sensory and Motor Phenomena:**\n    *   Loud ringing, pulsing in the head.\n    *   Pain in the body (pushed-in fingers, sore neck).\n    *   Buzzing/shaking sensation in the body.\n    *   The \"brain electric feeling\" (painful or, rarely, non-painful).\n    *   Muscle pains.\n    *   Mouth movements during the episode.\n    *   Feeling of spiraling.\n*   **After-Effects:**\n    *   Drained, sore feeling.\n    *   Foggy head, cognitive lag.\n*   **Triggers:**\n    *   Sleep deprivation.\n    *   Irregular sleep schedule.\n    *   Sleeping on your side.\n    *   Possible sleep apnea.\n\n**Differentiating Sleep Paralysis from Other Conditions**\n\nWhile many of your symptoms align with typical sleep paralysis, the sensory and motor phenomena, especially the \"brain electric feeling\" and the pain, raise questions that need medical evaluation. Here's why:\n\n*   **Sleep Paralysis:** A parasomnia (sleep disorder) characterized by temporary paralysis of the body shortly before falling asleep or upon waking. It's often accompanied by hallucinations, but these are usually visual or auditory, and less often involve intense physical sensations or pain.\n*   **Seizures:** While less likely, simple partial seizures (focal aware seizures) can involve unusual sensations, movements, and localized electrical activity in the brain. Some people experience auras (unusual sensations) before a seizure. The \"brain electric feeling\" could potentially be related to seizure activity, although it is less common during sleep.\n*   **Migraines:** Migraines can cause auras that include visual disturbances, sensory changes (tingling, numbness), and even motor weakness. They can also cause head pain, and the post-episode fog you describe could be related to a migraine.\n*   **Anxiety Disorders/Panic Attacks:** Intense anxiety can trigger physical symptoms, and panic attacks can occur during sleep. While anxiety can exacerbate sleep paralysis, it doesn't fully explain all your symptoms.\n*   **Sleep Apnea:** Sleep apnea is a condition where you stop breathing many times during the night. Symptoms can include loud snoring, gasping for air, and morning headaches. Lack of oxygen to the brain and poor sleep quality can have a negative impact on you and cause additional symptoms.\n\n**What You Can Do Right Now (While Awaiting Medical Care)**\n\n1.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize improving your sleep habits. This is the most important thing you can do right now to help manage your symptoms:\n    *   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, as much as possible.\n    *   **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Take a warm bath, read a book (not on a screen), listen to calming music, or practice meditation before bed.\n    *   **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n    *   **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol Before Bed:** These substances can disrupt sleep.\n    *   **Avoid Large Meals Before Bed:** Eating a heavy meal close to bedtime can make it harder to fall asleep.\n    *   **Regular Exercise (but not close to bedtime):** Physical activity can improve sleep quality, but avoid intense workouts in the evening.\n2.  **Sleep Position:** While you mentioned sleeping on your side, consider trying to maintain a slightly elevated position with pillows to help with potential sleep apnea.\n3.  **Detailed Symptom Diary:** This is crucial. Keep a log of each episode, noting:\n    *   Date and time.\n    *   Specific symptoms experienced (be as detailed as possible about the \"brain electric feeling,\" pain, hallucinations, etc.).\n    *   Duration of the episode.\n    *   What you were doing right before the episode.\n    *   Your sleep schedule leading up to the episode (how much sleep did you get the previous night?).\n    *   Stress levels.\n    *   Any medications or substances used (even over-the-counter).\n    *   Diet for the day (foods and caffeine or alcohol).\n4.  **Consider a Sleep App:** Some sleep apps can record audio and track movement during sleep. This might provide additional information to share with a doctor. **Important:** These apps are *not* a substitute for a sleep study.\n5.  **Reduce Stress:** Stress can worsen sleep paralysis and other conditions. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n6.  **Talk to Someone:** Share your experiences with a trusted friend or family member. Talking about it can help reduce anxiety and provide emotional support.\n7.  **Research Affordable Healthcare Options:** Look into community clinics, free clinics, and sliding-scale payment options in your area. Many hospitals also offer financial assistance programs.\n\n**When You Can Access Medical Care:**\n\n*   **See a Doctor (Ideally a Neurologist or Sleep Specialist):** The \"brain electric feeling\" and the pain need to be evaluated to rule out seizures, migraines, or other neurological conditions.\n*   **Discuss Your Symptom Diary:** Bring your detailed symptom diary to your appointment.\n*   **Ask About a Sleep Study (Polysomnography):** This is the gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders, including sleep apnea.\n*   **Discuss Treatment Options:** Depending on the diagnosis, treatment options may include medication, lifestyle changes, or therapy.\n*   **Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):** Even if you don't have insomnia, CBT-I can help improve sleep hygiene and reduce anxiety related to sleep.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding COVID and Healthcare Access**\n\nIt's understandable that you're hesitant to seek medical care due to COVID. Here are some things to consider:\n\n*   **Telemedicine:** Many doctors offer virtual appointments. This might be a good way to discuss your symptoms initially and determine if an in-person visit is necessary.\n*   **Vaccination and Boosters:** If you're not already vaccinated and boosted against COVID, consider getting vaccinated as soon as possible. This will significantly reduce your risk of severe illness.\n*   **Masking and Social Distancing:** If you do need to go to a doctor's office, wear a high-quality mask (N95 or KN95) and practice social distancing.\n*   **Inform the Clinic:** When you schedule an appointment, inform the clinic that you live with immunocompromised individuals. They may have specific protocols in place to protect you and your family.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nYour symptoms warrant a medical evaluation to rule out potentially serious conditions. In the meantime, focus on improving your sleep hygiene, keeping a detailed symptom diary, and managing your stress. When you're able to access healthcare, make sure to share all of your symptoms and your symptom diary with your doctor. This will help them make an accurate diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best in finding answers and relief.\n"

    "question": "Male 18 75kg 6ft black I started having these episodes last December. So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thank you for sharing this information. Given the experiences you've described, it's really important for you to seek medical attention *immediately*.  These episodes, especially the ones after the car crash with memory loss, are concerning and need proper evaluation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why it's important to see a doctor, and what they might investigate:\n\n**Why Immediate Medical Attention is Crucial:**\n\n*   **Possible Seizures (including Aura Epilepsies):** Your friend's suggestion of aura epilepsy is a valid consideration. Auras are often the first part of a seizure and can manifest in various ways, including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, strange sensations, and even emotional changes. The dizzy spells, nausea, and periods of unresponsiveness/confusion you describe could be seizure activity.  Absence seizures, in particular, can be very brief and cause a \"blanking out\" effect.\n*   **Post-Concussive Syndrome:**  Even if you felt \"uninjured\" after the car crash, a concussion is possible, especially given the memory loss. Concussions can cause a wide range of symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory problems, and emotional lability (like the crying spell at work). The fact that you had a crash and subsequent memory loss is very concerning for head trauma.\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:** Headaches, dizziness, memory problems, and alterations in consciousness can be symptoms of various neurological conditions besides seizures and concussion. A tumor, while less likely, needs to be ruled out. Other possibilities include migraines with aura, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or other structural brain issues.\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** While less likely given the potential memory loss after the car crash, it's important to note that sometimes episodes that look like seizures are related to psychological distress. These are real and need treatment, but the approach is different.\n\n**What a Doctor Will Likely Do:**\n\n1.  **Detailed History and Physical Exam:** The doctor will ask you many questions about your episodes, including:\n    *   A detailed description of each type of episode\n    *   What happens before, during, and after the episode\n    *   How frequent the episodes are\n    *   Any triggers you've identified\n    *   Your medical history, family history, and medication/substance use (including the social smoking/drinking)\n    *   They will also conduct a neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, sensation, and cognitive function.\n\n2.  **Diagnostic Tests:**\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This test records the electrical activity in your brain and can help identify seizure activity or other abnormalities. It is essential in diagnosing epilepsy.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** This imaging test provides detailed pictures of your brain and can help rule out tumors, structural abnormalities, or evidence of past strokes or injuries.  This is particularly important given the car crash and memory loss.\n    *   **CT Scan of the Brain:** May be done initially, especially in the emergency room after a crash, but MRI is generally preferred for more detailed evaluation.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** These can help rule out other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as electrolyte imbalances, infections, or metabolic disorders.\n    *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** This may be recommended if there are concerns about cognitive deficits or memory problems.\n\n**Steps You Should Take:**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor Immediately:** Don't delay.  Go to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if you feel unsafe or if you experience another significant episode.  Otherwise, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician as soon as possible.\n2.  **Be Thorough and Honest:**  Provide the doctor with a complete and accurate account of your symptoms, even if you feel embarrassed or unsure about something.\n3.  **Document Your Episodes:**  Keep a journal of your episodes, including the date, time, duration, symptoms, and any possible triggers.  If possible, ask someone who has witnessed your episodes to write down their observations as well.\n4.  **Avoid Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery:** Until you have been evaluated by a doctor and your condition is under control, it is important to avoid activities that could put you or others at risk. Driving with undiagnosed seizures is extremely dangerous and often illegal.\n5.  **Avoid Alcohol and Illicit Drugs:** These substances can lower the seizure threshold and make seizures more likely. Alcohol can also worsen post-concussive symptoms.\n6.  **Don't Self-Diagnose or Self-Treat:**  It's tempting to try to figure things out on your own, but it's important to get a professional diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n**In summary, the combination of your recent episodes, the car crash, and the memory loss warrants immediate and thorough medical evaluation.  Please prioritize your health and seek medical attention as soon as possible.**\n"

    "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this sounds incredibly frustrating, and I completely understand your anxiety about flying given your history. It's good you've already seen specialists and ruled out some serious conditions, but it's clear the \"drink more water\" advice isn't cutting it. Let's break down potential causes and actionable steps for your upcoming flight.\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms & Potential Causes**\n\nYour symptoms of dizziness, heat, clamminess, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and loss of consciousness strongly suggest **vasovagal syncope**.  This is essentially a temporary drop in blood pressure and heart rate that reduces blood flow to the brain.  It's often triggered by things like:\n\n*   **Prolonged Standing/Sitting:** Pooling of blood in the legs.\n*   **Emotional Stress/Anxiety:** Flight anxiety is a big factor here.\n*   **Pain:**  Even subtle pain can be a trigger.\n*   **Dehydration:**  While you're drinking a lot of water, it might not be enough to compensate for the dry air and other factors on a flight.\n*   **Heat:** As you mentioned, heat can trigger these episodes on land.\n*   **Dietary Issues:** A history of disordered eating can sometimes affect the body's regulatory systems.\n\n**Why Airplanes Exacerbate Vasovagal Syncope**\n\nAirplanes present a unique combination of triggers:\n\n*   **Lower Cabin Pressure:** The reduced oxygen level at altitude can further stress your system.\n*   **Dehydration:** Airplanes are notoriously dry environments.\n*   **Prolonged Sitting:** Blood pools in your legs.\n*   **Anxiety:** Flying itself can be anxiety-provoking.\n*   **Turbulence:** The stress of turbulence can exacerbate the above factors.\n\n**Actionable Steps to Take Before & During Your Flight**\n\nGiven your history, a multi-pronged approach is best:\n\n**1.  Pre-Flight Preparation:**\n\n*   **Talk to Your Doctor Again:** Explain your ongoing concerns and ask specifically about *vasovagal syncope*. Ask if they have any further suggestions based on your specific history and test results. They may also suggest a different type of test or have further insight.\n*   **Consider a Beta-Blocker (Discuss with Doctor):** In some cases of frequent vasovagal syncope, doctors prescribe a low-dose beta-blocker to help regulate heart rate and blood pressure.  *This MUST be prescribed by your doctor after a thorough evaluation.* Don't self-medicate.\n*   **Compression Stockings:** You're already doing this, which is excellent. Make sure they are fitted properly and go up to at least your knees.\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Start hydrating well *several days* before your flight. Don't just chug water the day of.\n*   **Sodium Intake:** You're taking salt tablets, but make sure you're not overdoing it. Too much sodium can also be problematic. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can advise on the appropriate amount for you.\n*   **Magnesium Supplement:** Consider taking a magnesium supplement in the week leading up to your flight (after discussing with your doctor). Magnesium is involved in muscle and nerve function and can sometimes help with vasovagal symptoms.\n*   **Pack a Medical Kit:** Include electrolyte tablets, a small snack (salty crackers, pretzels), and a cooling towel.\n*   **Prepare a Brief Explanation:** Write down a short, concise explanation of your condition to give to flight attendants if you feel symptoms coming on. This can reduce stress and ensure they understand what's happening.  Something like, \"I have a history of vasovagal syncope. I sometimes faint. If I look pale or dizzy, please help me lie down and elevate my legs.\"\n*   **Airport Assistance:** Call your airline ahead of time and request wheelchair assistance to your gate. This is a good option because it takes the stress out of finding your gate in a busy airport and you'll be able to sit while waiting.\n\n**2. During the Flight:**\n\n*   **Choose Your Seat Wisely:** Aisle seat is preferable to allow you to get up and move around easily. Choose a seat near the bathroom as you will be drinking a lot of water and may need it more often than usual.\n*   **Hydration:** Continue drinking fluids regularly throughout the flight. Aim for small, frequent sips rather than large gulps.\n*   **Electrolytes:** Sip on electrolyte-enhanced drinks (sports drinks, electrolyte tablets dissolved in water) periodically. This helps your body retain fluids and maintain blood volume.\n*   **Movement:** Every 30-60 minutes, get up and walk around the cabin. If you can't get up, do ankle pumps, calf raises, and leg stretches in your seat to promote blood circulation.\n*   **Isometric Exercises:** While seated, tense and release your leg muscles (thighs, calves, glutes) for 5-10 seconds at a time. This helps push blood back up to your heart.\n*   **Cooling Towel:** If you start feeling hot or dizzy, use a cooling towel on your neck and forehead.\n*   **Mindfulness & Relaxation:** Practice deep breathing exercises, meditation, or listen to calming music to reduce anxiety. There are many guided meditation apps specifically designed for flying.\n*   **Avoid Triggers:** If you know certain smells or situations trigger you, try to avoid them.\n*   **Notify Flight Attendants:** As soon as you board, discreetly inform a flight attendant that you have a history of fainting. This will allow them to be more attentive and respond quickly if you experience symptoms.\n*   **Stay Grounded:** Try to avoid looking out the window too much.\n*   **Elevate Your Feet:** Store your carry-on under the seat in front of you to raise your feet slightly.\n\n**3.  If You Feel Symptoms Coming On:**\n\n*   **Lie Down Immediately:** If possible, lie down on the floor with your legs elevated. This is the most effective way to increase blood flow to your brain. Don't be embarrassed.\n*   **Alert a Flight Attendant:** Let them know you're feeling faint.\n*   **Loosen Tight Clothing:** Loosen your belt, collar, or anything else that might be constricting blood flow.\n*   **Deep Breathing:** Focus on slow, deep breaths.\n*   **Clench Your Fists:** This can help increase blood pressure.\n*   **Cross Your Legs and Squeeze:** Cross your legs tightly and squeeze your thigh muscles together. This also helps increase blood pressure.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Anxiety Management:** Your anxiety about fainting *can* trigger a fainting episode. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor experienced in anxiety management. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be very helpful.\n*   **Ruling out Orthostatic Hypotension:** While your tests were normal, ask your doctor specifically about *orthostatic hypotension*. This is a drop in blood pressure when standing up, and it might not be consistently detected during routine testing. A tilt table test might be considered if there's still suspicion.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Don't push yourself beyond your limits. If you're feeling unwell, rest.\n*   **Re-Evaluate Your Diet:** Since you mentioned a history of disordered eating, it's worth revisiting your dietary habits with a registered dietitian. They can help you ensure you're getting adequate nutrients and electrolytes.\n\n**In summary, your priority is to manage triggers, increase blood volume, and be prepared to react quickly if you feel symptoms. Talking to your doctor again and exploring a beta-blocker for your flight may be beneficial.**\nYou are already doing so many things right. I hope this additional advice helps you feel more prepared and less anxious for your upcoming flight. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and unheard. You've experienced a significant life change with the onset of epilepsy, and the subsequent changes in your energy levels and ability to exercise are clearly impacting your well-being. It's also disheartening when medical professionals don't seem to fully grasp your experience.\n\nLet's break down some potential avenues to explore, and how you might approach them with your doctors:\n\n**1. Keppra and Side Effects:**\n\n*   **Common Side Effects:** Keppra (levetiracetam) is a common anti-epileptic drug (AED), but it can have side effects. While many people on r/epilepsy might not report the *exact* same experience, fatigue and weakness are commonly reported side effects.\n*   **Individual Variability:** Everyone reacts differently to medication. Just because others don't report the same issue doesn't mean it's not a side effect for you.\n*   **Vitamin/Mineral Deficiencies:** Some AEDs, including Keppra, can impact the absorption or metabolism of certain vitamins and minerals. It would be worth asking for vitamin panel bloodwork (including B vitamins, vitamin D, magnesium, and iron) to check for deficiencies.\n\n**2. Epilepsy Itself and Energy Levels:**\n\n*   **Postictal Fatigue:** Seizures are neurologically exhausting. Even when you think you're recovered, your brain might still be recovering. The brain's energy demand changes after a seizure and between seizures. This could lead to fatigue, even if you're not having *visible* seizures.\n*   **Subclinical Seizures:** It's possible to have seizures that don't manifest as obvious convulsions. These \"silent\" or \"subclinical\" seizures can still drain your energy. An EEG might detect these, but a normal EEG doesn't entirely rule them out. If your doctor thinks this could be the case, they may recommend an ambulatory EEG for longer monitoring.\n\n**3. Weight Gain and Energy:**\n\n*   **The \"Chicken or the Egg\" Problem:** You're right that it's not necessarily a simple case of weight gain *causing* the fatigue. The fatigue and reduced ability to exercise likely contributed to the weight gain.\n*   **Metabolic Changes:** Epilepsy and/or AEDs can sometimes affect metabolism, potentially making it easier to gain weight.\n*   **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal issues like thyroid problems can cause both fatigue and weight gain. Ask your doctor for a thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4).\n\n**4. Autoimmune Connection:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy and Autoimmunity:** There *is* a growing understanding of the potential link between epilepsy and autoimmune diseases. Some types of epilepsy are directly caused by autoimmune antibodies attacking the brain (e.g., autoimmune encephalitis).\n*   **Symptoms of Autoimmune Disease:** Common symptoms of autoimmune disease include fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, skin rashes, cognitive dysfunction, and digestive issues.\n*   **Testing:** Your doctor can order an autoimmune panel (ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-thyroid antibodies) to check for certain autoimmune diseases. You might also need a referral to a neurologist specializing in autoimmune neurology if your doctor thinks it is warranted.\n\n**5. \"Leaky Gut\" and Inflammation:**\n\n*   **The Gut-Brain Axis:** The gut microbiome and the brain are closely linked. Inflammation in the gut can influence brain function and potentially contribute to neurological problems.\n*   **Scientific Evidence:** While the \"leaky gut\" theory is popular, it's important to approach it cautiously. While it is associated with the gut-brain axis and inflammation, there's a lot of pseudoscience in the same space. It might be more helpful to understand that the gut-brain axis is a factor and look into eating an anti-inflammatory diet to try and improve gut and brain health.\n*   **Diet and Lifestyle:** Focusing on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, fiber, and probiotics can support gut health.\n\n**6. Strategies for Communicating with Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Prepare a Detailed History:** Write down your symptoms, when they started, how they've changed over time, and what you've tried already. Be specific about how the fatigue affects your daily life.\n*   **Be Assertive, But Respectful:** Advocate for yourself, but try to maintain a respectful dialogue. Explain that you understand the common side effects of Keppra, but your experience seems different.\n*   **Focus on Function:** Instead of focusing on weight, frame the issue as \"I'm unable to function at the level I used to because of this fatigue.\"\n*   **Ask Specific Questions:** For example: \"Could my fatigue be related to my Keppra dosage? Could we check my vitamin levels? Could we explore the possibility of subclinical seizures?\"\n*   **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you feel your concerns are being dismissed, seek a second opinion from another neurologist or a doctor specializing in fatigue or autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Steps to Take Now:**\n\n1.  **Start a Detailed Symptom Journal:** Track your energy levels, sleep patterns, diet, seizure activity (if any), medications, and any other relevant factors.\n2.  **Gather Medical Records:** Collect your medical history, including seizure reports, EEG results, and medication lists.\n3.  **Research Doctors:** Look for neurologists with experience in epilepsy and/or autoimmune disorders.\n4.  **Schedule an Appointment:** Prepare your questions and concerns in advance.\n5.  **Focus on a Balanced Approach:** Start with small, manageable exercise goals. Don't try to jump back into your previous routine immediately. Prioritize sleep, stress management, and a healthy diet.\n\nIt's essential to work *with* your doctor to explore these possibilities. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek further investigation if you feel your concerns are not being addressed adequately.\n\n**Important Note:** *This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.*\n"

    "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",

    "answer": "This sounds like a very frightening and disruptive experience. It's good that you're seeing a neurologist, as it's important to get a proper diagnosis. While I cannot provide a diagnosis, I can discuss some possibilities and things the neurologist might consider based on the information you've provided.\n\n**Possible Considerations & Things the Neurologist Will Likely Investigate:**\n\n*   **Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas) Toxicity or Reaction:** While rare, adverse reactions to nitrous oxide can occur. Although the initial CT scan was clear, delayed effects of nitrous oxide are possible, especially given the severity of your initial reaction and how long it took to wear off. Nitrous oxide can affect vitamin B12 absorption, which can lead to neurological problems if levels become significantly low. Your neurologist might check your B12 levels and homocysteine levels.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrous oxide irreversibly oxidizes cobalt in vitamin B12, inactivating enzymes that are important in brain function. This can lead to demyelination (damage to the protective coating of nerve fibers) in the spinal cord and brain.\n\n*   **Seizure Disorder:** Although the initial CT scan was negative, seizures can still be a possibility. The description of your event (loss of consciousness, hyperventilation, seizure-like movements, inability to speak/move) and the subsequent \"freezing\" episodes warrant further investigation.\n    *   **Types:** The neurologist will try to determine if these are focal seizures (affecting one area of the brain) or generalized seizures (affecting the whole brain).  The \"aura\" you described before one of your freezing episodes is common with focal seizures.  Absence seizures are also a possibility, given the brief freezing episodes.\n    *   **Testing:** An EEG (electroencephalogram) is the standard test to detect abnormal brain activity associated with seizures.  Sometimes, a single EEG is not enough, and prolonged EEG monitoring (e.g., 24-hour or even several days) is needed to capture events.\n\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope or Cardiac Issues:** Although your EKG was normal, repeated episodes of lightheadedness, especially if they occur when standing, could point to vasovagal syncope (fainting due to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure). The neurologist might want to rule out any underlying cardiac arrhythmias as well.\n\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** PNES are seizure-like events that are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are a type of conversion disorder (a mental health condition where psychological stress manifests as physical symptoms). This is often a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes need to be ruled out first.  Your lack of a personal or family history of mental health conditions doesn't necessarily exclude this as a possibility.\n\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** Some types of migraines can present with neurological symptoms that mimic seizures, such as sensory disturbances, weakness, and difficulty speaking. However, the symptoms you've described seem more prolonged and different from typical migraine auras.\n\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** Similar to PNES, FND is a condition where there is a problem with how the brain functions, leading to a variety of neurological symptoms, such as weakness, movement problems, speech difficulties, and sensory disturbances. Again, this diagnosis is typically made after excluding other organic causes.\n\n*   **Rare Neurological Conditions:** There are some rarer neurological conditions that can present with similar symptoms, but these are less likely and would require more specialized testing to diagnose.\n\n**What the Neurologist Might Do:**\n\n*   **Detailed History:** They will ask very specific questions about the events you've described, including the timing, duration, triggers, and associated symptoms.\n*   **Neurological Exam:** This will assess your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, sensation, and cognitive function.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To look for abnormal brain activity.\n*   **MRI of the Brain:** Provides more detailed images of the brain than a CT scan and can help rule out structural abnormalities.\n*   **Blood Tests:** To check for vitamin deficiencies (B12, etc.), electrolyte imbalances, and other potential metabolic causes.\n*   **Possibly Referrals:** Depending on the findings, they may refer you to a cardiologist, psychiatrist, or other specialist.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Log:** Keep a detailed log of your freezing episodes, including the date, time, duration, triggers, symptoms, and anything you were doing at the time. This will be very helpful for the neurologist.\n*   **Video Record:** If possible and safe, try to have someone video record one of your \"freezing\" episodes. This can provide valuable information to the neurologist.\n*   **Be Open and Honest:** Be open and honest with the neurologist about all of your symptoms and concerns.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't hesitate to ask questions and advocate for yourself if you feel like your concerns are not being adequately addressed.\n\nIt's understandable to be anxious about this. The most important thing is to work closely with your neurologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.  I wish you the best in getting answers and appropriate care.\n"

    "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, it sounds like you've pieced together a potential connection between your birth experience and some of the health issues you've experienced later in life. Let's break down the potential link between birth asphyxia and later developmental and neurological issues, and what you can do now.\n\n**Birth Asphyxia: A Quick Overview**\n\nBirth asphyxia (also called perinatal asphyxia or neonatal encephalopathy) occurs when a baby doesn't receive enough oxygen before, during, or immediately after birth. This lack of oxygen can lead to brain damage due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The severity of the damage depends on how long the brain is deprived of oxygen. You mentioned being placed in a \"cool environment\" and ice being used. This likely refers to therapeutic hypothermia, which is a standard treatment for HIE. Cooling the baby's body helps to slow down the metabolic processes in the brain and reduce the severity of brain damage.\n\n**Potential Long-Term Consequences of Birth Asphyxia**\n\nThe potential long-term consequences of birth asphyxia vary widely, depending on the severity of the oxygen deprivation and the areas of the brain affected. Here's how it relates to your specific concerns:\n\n*   **ADHD/ADD:** There is a documented association between perinatal asphyxia and an increased risk of ADHD. The brain areas affected by oxygen deprivation (like the frontal lobes, which are important for attention and executive function) can contribute to ADHD-like symptoms. Studies have indicated that children who experience birth asphyxia may have a higher prevalence of ADHD. While your birth asphyxia could be a contributing factor, ADHD also has a strong genetic component.\n\n*   **Seizures:** Seizures are a well-known complication of birth asphyxia, particularly in the immediate newborn period. While not everyone who experiences birth asphyxia will develop epilepsy, the risk is increased. Your sensitivity to flashing lights could potentially be related to a lower seizure threshold, which *could* be a consequence of the birth asphyxia, although this is something to be investigated with a doctor. Photosensitivity can be associated with certain types of epilepsy or migraine.\n\n*   **Other Potential Issues:** Depending on the severity of the asphyxia, other potential long-term consequences can include:\n    *   Cerebral Palsy: Affects movement, posture, and coordination.\n    *   Cognitive Impairment: Difficulties with learning, memory, and problem-solving.\n    *   Developmental Delays: Slower progress in reaching developmental milestones.\n    *   Visual or Hearing Impairments.\n    *   Learning Disabilities: Difficulties with reading, writing, or math.\n\n**What to Do Now**\n\n1.  **Consult with a Neurologist:** This is the most important step. A neurologist can assess your symptoms (ADHD and photosensitivity), review your birth history (especially the severity of the asphyxia), and conduct appropriate testing. They can help determine if your birth asphyxia is contributing to your current health issues. An EEG (electroencephalogram) might be considered to assess brain activity and look for any signs of seizure activity, especially in relation to flashing lights.\n2.  **Review Medical Records:** If possible, obtain your birth records and any medical documentation from your early infancy. This information will be invaluable for the neurologist.\n3.  **Genetic Testing:** Since you have ADHD, consider discussing genetic testing with your healthcare provider. This can help determine if there are genetic factors contributing to your condition, independent of your birth history.\n4.  **ADHD Management:** Continue working with a healthcare provider or psychiatrist to manage your ADHD symptoms. Treatment options can include medication, therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy is often helpful), and lifestyle modifications (like improving sleep, diet, and exercise).\n5.  **Photosensitivity Precautions:** If you are sensitive to flashing lights, take steps to avoid triggers. This might include wearing sunglasses outdoors, adjusting screen brightness on electronic devices, and avoiding environments with strobe lights.\n6.  **Consider Therapy/Counseling:** Understanding the potential impact of a traumatic birth experience can be helpful, especially if you or your parents have any residual feelings of guilt or anxiety related to the event.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Correlation vs. Causation:** While birth asphyxia *can* increase the risk of certain conditions, it doesn't automatically *cause* them. There may be other factors involved, such as genetics or environmental influences.\n*   **Early Intervention:** It's great that you're exploring this now at 28. While some consequences of birth asphyxia are apparent early in life, others may not become evident until later. Early intervention can help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** Avoid relying solely on online information. The internet can be a valuable resource, but it's not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. By working closely with your healthcare providers, you can gain a better understanding of your health and develop a personalized treatment plan to address your specific needs.\n"

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down your symptoms and address your concerns. It sounds like you've been through a lot lately, and the combination of physical symptoms and heightened anxiety can be very distressing. It's good that you're seeking information and trying to understand what's going on.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of your symptoms and potential causes, keeping in mind I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only, and you must consult with a qualified medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan:**\n\n*   **Phantom Smells (Phantosmia):**\n    *   **Possible Causes:** While you had an EEG that ruled out Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, other possible causes can include:\n        *   **Sinus issues:** Infections, allergies, or polyps can sometimes cause altered sense of smell.\n        *   **Migraines:** Some people experience olfactory auras before or during migraines.\n        *   **Head trauma:** Even minor head injuries can sometimes affect smell.\n        *   **Medications:** Certain medications can alter the sense of smell.\n        *   **Neurological conditions:** Although less likely given your EEG, it's important to consider other possible neurological causes.\n    *   **Relevance to your situation:** The fact that these have stopped for a few weeks is encouraging.\n\n*   **Eye Floaters and Flashing Lights:**\n    *   **Eye Floaters:** These are common, especially as we age, but a sudden increase can be a sign of a more serious problem.\n    *   **Flashing Lights (Photopsia):** These can be caused by:\n        *   **Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD):** This is a common age-related change where the vitreous humor (the gel-like substance inside your eye) pulls away from the retina. It's often harmless, but it can sometimes cause a retinal tear or detachment. *This needs to be ruled out.*\n        *   **Migraines:** Some people experience visual auras (like flashing lights) with or without a headache.\n        *   **Retinal Tear or Detachment:** *This is the most serious concern and needs to be ruled out by an eye doctor.*\n    *   **Relevance to your situation:** *The flashing lights, especially in the outer corner of your eye, warrant an immediate visit to an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). They need to dilate your eyes and examine your retina to rule out a tear or detachment. This is crucial.*\n\n*   **Other Symptoms:**\n    *   **High-Pitched Noise in Ear (Tinnitus):**\n        *   **Possible Causes:** Stress, anxiety, earwax buildup, exposure to loud noise, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions.\n    *   **Muscle Twitching (Fasciculations):**\n        *   **Possible Causes:** Stress, anxiety, fatigue, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, caffeine intake. Rarely, muscle twitching can be a sign of a more serious neurological condition, but this is less likely, especially if it's widespread and not accompanied by weakness.\n    *   **Headaches:**\n        *   **Possible Causes:** Tension headaches (often related to stress and anxiety), migraines, dehydration, eye strain.\n    *   **Lightheadedness:**\n        *   **Possible Causes:** Anxiety, dehydration, low blood sugar, low iron (you mentioned this), orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing), inner ear problems.\n    *   **Cognitive Issues (Word Finding Difficulty, Loss of Train of Thought, \"Daydreamy\" Feeling):**\n        *   **Possible Causes:** Stress, anxiety, depression, lack of sleep, nutritional deficiencies, certain medications.\n    *   **Tooth Decay:** This can contribute to overall inflammation in the body and potentially impact other systems.\n    *   **Anxiety and Depression:** These conditions can absolutely cause a wide range of physical symptoms.\n\n**Can Stress Do All This?**\n\nYes, *severe* stress and anxiety *can* cause or exacerbate many of the symptoms you're experiencing.  Stress can impact the nervous system, immune system, and hormonal balance, leading to a variety of physical and psychological manifestations. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions before attributing everything solely to stress.\n\n**Brain Tumor Concerns:**\n\nIt's understandable that you're worried about a brain tumor, especially with the combination of neurological symptoms. However, your GP not being overly concerned and a normal EEG are reassuring. Brain tumors are relatively rare, and often present with more persistent and progressive symptoms, such as severe headaches, seizures, weakness, or changes in personality.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **See an Ophthalmologist (Eye Doctor) Immediately:**  *This is the most important step.*  The flashing lights could indicate a retinal tear or detachment, which needs prompt treatment to prevent vision loss. Explain your symptoms clearly and emphasize the flashing lights.\n2.  **Follow Up with Your GP:** Discuss the ophthalmologist's findings and any remaining concerns. Mention the persistent tinnitus, muscle twitching, and cognitive issues. Review your iron levels and consider further blood tests if necessary.\n3.  **Address Your Anxiety and Depression:**  Continue with any therapy or medication you're receiving. If you're not currently in treatment, seek professional help.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medication can be very effective in managing anxiety and depression.\n4.  **Improve Your Lifestyle:**\n    *   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n    *   **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Stay hydrated.\n    *   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help reduce stress and improve mood.\n    *   **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n5.  **Dental Care:** Address the decaying tooth as soon as possible to prevent further infection and inflammation.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nWhile stress and anxiety likely play a significant role in your symptoms, the flashing lights in your vision are a red flag that needs immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Following up with your GP and prioritizing your mental health are also crucial steps.  Remember, it's always best to be proactive about your health and seek professional medical advice to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and express your concerns to your healthcare providers.\n"

    "question": "Hello all, I had a question about my medication and fasting, if that's alright. I take Keppra twice a day (500mg each), once in the morning and once at night. With Ramadan approaching I was wondering how much time there needs to be in between taking one pill at night and one in the morning, thanks.Let me know if I need to add anything else.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. You're asking about how to adjust your Keppra (levetiracetam) dosing schedule during Ramadan, considering the fasting periods.\n\nIt's important to be mindful that I'm not a medical professional and so, the information I'm giving you is only meant to be used as a discussion point with your medical team, not a replacement for their medical advice.\n\nGiven that you take Keppra twice a day, ideally 12 hours apart, here's a breakdown of how you can approach this during Ramadan, and important considerations:\n\n**General Strategy:**\n\n*   **Maximize the Time Difference Within Permitted Windows:** The goal is to get as close to the 12-hour spacing as possible within the *iftar* (breaking fast) to *suhoor* (pre-dawn meal) window.\n\n**Typical Scenario (Example):**\n\nLet's assume:\n\n*   *Iftar* (sunset) is around 7:00 PM\n*   *Suhoor* (pre-dawn) is around 5:00 AM\n\n**Possible Adjusted Schedule:**\n\n1.  **Evening Dose:** Take your 500mg Keppra immediately at *iftar* (around 7:00 PM).\n2.  **Morning Dose:** Take your 500mg Keppra as late as possible during *suhoor* (around 5:00 AM).\n\nIn this example, there's approximately 10 hours between doses, but you are still within your eating window.\n\n**Important Considerations and What You MUST Discuss with Your Doctor:**\n\n*   **Talk to Your Neurologist/Doctor is Mandatory:** This is absolutely crucial.  **Do not change your medication schedule without consulting your doctor.**  They need to assess your specific situation, seizure history, Keppra dosage, and potential risks.  They can also advise on how to monitor for any breakthrough seizures or side effects. They might want to do blood tests to monitor Keppra levels if they are concerned about the change in schedule.\n*   **Seizure Threshold:** Some individuals have a lower seizure threshold than others. A shorter interval between doses (e.g., less than 10 hours consistently) *might* increase the risk of seizures in *some* people. Your doctor needs to assess this risk.\n*   **Missed Doses:** Be extra vigilant about not missing doses.  Missing a dose can significantly increase the risk of seizures. Set alarms and reminders.\n*   **Side Effects:** Monitor closely for any side effects of Keppra, especially if you adjust the timing. Common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, irritability, and mood changes. Report any changes to your doctor.\n*   **Extended Fasting:** Be aware of the length of the fasting period.  If the time between *iftar* and *suhoor* is very short, it might be more challenging to maintain a reasonable interval between doses.\n*   **Consider a Different Medication (Potentially):** In some cases, your doctor *might* consider switching you to a different anti-seizure medication with a longer half-life that might be easier to manage during Ramadan. However, this is a significant decision that should only be made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits.\n*   **Breaking the Fast (If Necessary):**  Your health is paramount. If you feel unwell, experience seizure symptoms (aura, etc.), or have concerns about your medication, you *must* break your fast and take your medication.  Discuss this scenario with your religious leader as well.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"Given my Keppra dosage and seizure history, how safe is it to adjust my dosing schedule during Ramadan?\"\n*   \"What is the minimum acceptable time between doses that I can safely maintain?\"\n*   \"What specific symptoms should I watch out for that would indicate I need to break my fast and take my medication?\"\n*   \"Would blood tests to monitor Keppra levels be helpful during this time?\"\n*   \"Are there alternative anti-seizure medications that might be easier to manage during Ramadan, considering their dosing schedules?\"\n\n**In summary: Talk to your doctor immediately. They will be able to give you tailored medical advice that is specific to your body.**\n"

    "question": "Recently I got a hickie, and tons of people started telling me to be careful because I could die, and stuff. Is it that dangerous? Male 17, epilepsy, anxiety, question: are hickies dangerous?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's address this. It's understandable you're concerned given the reactions you've gotten.\n\n**The Truth About Hickies and Danger**\n\n*   **Rare, but Possible Risks:** A hickey, which is essentially a bruise caused by suction, *very, very rarely* can lead to a stroke. The mechanism is that vigorous sucking can, in extremely rare cases, damage a major blood vessel in the neck (the carotid artery). This damage could potentially lead to a blood clot forming, and if that clot travels to the brain, it could cause a stroke.\n\n*   **Extremely Uncommon:** It's important to emphasize how rare this is. The vast majority of hickies are harmless. The stroke risk is exceptionally low.\n\n*   **More Likely with Vigorous Sucking:** The risk is higher if the sucking is very forceful and prolonged, directly over a major blood vessel.\n\n**Your Specific Situation (Epilepsy, Anxiety)**\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** A stroke, even a minor one, *could* potentially impact your seizure threshold, but this is indirect and dependent on the area of the brain affected by the stroke. It's best to mention this to your neurologist.\n*   **Anxiety:** The comments you've received are likely fueling your anxiety. It's important to put this in perspective: the risk is tiny.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Relax (Mostly):** Seriously. The odds of a hickey causing a serious problem are minuscule.\n2.  **Be Mindful:** If you choose to engage in activities that might lead to hickies, be aware of where they are placed (avoiding direct pressure over major neck arteries) and the intensity of the suction.\n3.  **Monitor for Symptoms:** Although very rare, be aware of the following potential symptoms:\n    *   Weakness or numbness on one side of the body\n    *   Difficulty speaking or understanding speech\n    *   Sudden severe headache\n    *   Vision changes\n    *   Dizziness or loss of balance\n\n    *If you experience ANY of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.*\n4.  **Talk to a Doctor (If Concerned):** If you're genuinely worried, the best course of action is to talk to your doctor or neurologist. They can assess your individual risk factors and provide personalized advice. Bringing up your epilepsy and how it may be affected is imperative.\n5.  **Address Anxiety:** If your anxiety is significantly elevated due to this, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies for managing anxiety and putting risks into perspective.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nHickies are generally not dangerous. The risk of a stroke is extremely low. Be mindful of the intensity and location of the activity that could lead to one. Monitor for concerning symptoms (though it's unlikely you'll experience any). If your anxiety is high, seek professional help.\n"

    "question": "30 AFAB, 158cm/61kg, hispanic, Symptoms: lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods. flu-ish [see below] since a month ago.Diagnoses: Epilepsy, ADHD, Endometriosis, 5cm ovarian cyst, migrainesMedications: Lamotrigine 225mg, Ibuprofen for endometriosis pain, very occasional Concerta, haven't used it for a few months, melatonin over the summer (stopped it about two months ago)Others: Drink 1-2 drinks monthly, Slowly stopping smoking down from 6 to 1-2 per day and 1 light snus, last two days have started taking Vitamin D and I have been using a therapy lamp for 20 min every morning for the last two weeks. Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, this is a lot to unpack, and it's smart of you to be proactive about your health, especially given your family history and existing diagnoses. It sounds like you're doing a good job monitoring and trying to address things yourself, but some of these symptoms definitely warrant a doctor's visit sooner rather than later.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my recommendations, focusing on urgency:\n\n**GO TO THE DOCTOR ASAP (within a few days):**\n\n*   **Darker Urine and Lightheadedness/Fatigue (Combined):** This combination raises a red flag for potential liver or kidney issues. While it *could* be dehydration, the fact that it persists even with high water intake, coupled with the fatigue and lightheadedness, needs to be investigated.  This is *especially* concerning given your other symptoms and medications.\n*   **Increased Ovarian Pain/Fullness:** The change in pain levels and sensation of fullness in the cyst area is worrisome. A 5cm cyst isn't necessarily dangerous, but increased pain can indicate:\n    *   **Torsion:**  Twisting of the ovary, cutting off blood supply (requires urgent intervention).\n    *   **Rupture:** Cyst bursting can cause significant pain and internal bleeding.\n    *   **Growth:** A change in size warrants reassessment.\n    *   **Rarely, but importantly, it could be related to something else.**  Given your family history, any changes in ovarian cyst symptoms should be taken seriously.\n    *   **Avoid strenuous exercise/stretching until you've been evaluated.** While not always the case, exercise *can* potentially contribute to torsion or rupture if the cyst is already compromised.\n\n**SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN 1-2 WEEKS:**\n\n*   **Very Light Periods:** While negative pregnancy tests are reassuring, a significant change in menstrual flow needs to be evaluated. Possible causes include:\n    *   **Hormonal Imbalance:**  This is common, especially with endometriosis and potential stress from moving countries. However, it needs investigation.\n    *   **Endometrial Issues:**  Rarely, changes in bleeding patterns can indicate problems with the uterine lining.\n    *   **Thyroid Issues:**  Hypothyroidism can affect periods and cause fatigue.\n    *   **Medication Side Effects:**  While less likely, Lamotrigine can sometimes affect hormone levels in some individuals.\n*   **Persistent Flu-like Symptoms:**  Feeling constantly like you're catching a cold for a month isn't normal.  Consider:\n    *   **Underlying Infection:**  Something chronic that your immune system isn't clearing.\n    *   **Autoimmune Issues:**  (Less likely, but needs consideration if symptoms persist).\n    *   **Iron Deficiency:**  Since you've had this before, it's worth checking again.\n    *   **Side effect:** medications can cause those symptoms as well.\n\n**Things to Mention to Your Doctor (Regardless of Urgency):**\n\n*   **All Symptoms:** Provide a complete picture of all your symptoms (lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods, ovarian pain, flu-like symptoms, demotivation).\n*   **Medication List:** Provide an updated list of ALL medications and supplements, including dosages and frequency.\n*   **Lifestyle Changes:** Mention the smoking cessation attempts, vitamin D supplementation, and therapy lamp use.\n*   **Diet and Hydration:**  Reiterate that you're maintaining a balanced diet and drinking plenty of water.\n*   **Family History:**  Emphasize the history of cancer in your family.\n*   **Quality of Life:** Make it clear how these symptoms are affecting your daily life and ability to exercise.\n\n**Why This Requires a Doctor (Instead of Just \"Waiting It Out\"):**\n\n*   **Multiple Symptoms:**  The combination of symptoms is more concerning than any one symptom in isolation. It suggests a possible systemic issue.\n*   **Potential Overlap:**  Some symptoms could be related (e.g., fatigue and darker urine could be kidney-related; ovarian pain could be affecting appetite and energy levels).\n*   **Risk of Misdiagnosis:** You're right to be concerned about writing things off as \"just depression/hormones.\" It's essential to rule out other medical causes.\n*   **Your Existing Conditions:**  Epilepsy, ADHD, and endometriosis can all be affected by hormonal changes, stress, and other medical conditions. It's important to ensure that these are being properly managed in light of your new symptoms.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"What blood tests should I have to evaluate my kidney and liver function, thyroid, iron levels, and overall health?\"\n*   \"Given my family history, should I have any further investigations into my ovarian cyst, such as an ultrasound or MRI?\"\n*   \"Could my medications be contributing to any of these symptoms, and if so, what are the alternatives?\"\n*   \"What are the possible causes of my significantly lighter periods, and what further testing is recommended?\"\n*   \"If my symptoms are not related to my existing conditions, what other potential diagnoses should we consider?\"\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Stress:**  Moving to a new country is incredibly stressful. Stress can exacerbate many of these symptoms. Consider stress management techniques (meditation, yoga, talking to a therapist).\n*   **Smoking Cessation:**  Quitting smoking is excellent for your health! However, withdrawal symptoms can include fatigue, irritability, and changes in appetite.  Be patient with yourself and seek support if needed.\n\n**In summary, please prioritise a doctor's appointment ASAP to investigate the darker urine and increased ovarian pain, and book an appointment for the other symptoms within the next week or two.** Don't hesitate to go to the emergency room if you experience severe, sudden pain.\n"

    "question": "I\u2019m (40F) 5ft 8, 164lbs, caucasian. Medications: Lamotrigine and Sertraline Health conditions: ADHD, Tourette\u2019s, epilepsy and severe degenerative disc disease. I don\u2019t have a current issue but every time I\u2019ve had surgery I wake up completely full of beans, even when I\u2019ve just woken up in recovery. I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can\u2019t stop giggling. I don\u2019t feel sick at all and always want water and food immediately. Drs/nurses etc have commented it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even have surgery, but I\u2019ve never asked if there\u2019s a reason why. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I\u2019ve never been told I\u2019m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a really interesting phenomenon, and while I can't give you a definitive diagnosis without examining you and knowing the specifics of your surgical procedures and anesthetic agents used, I can offer some potential explanations based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Possible Contributing Factors:**\n\n*   **Medication Interactions:**\n\n    *   **Sertraline (SSRI) and Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer):** Both of these medications affect neurotransmitters in the brain. It's possible that they could influence how you react to anesthesia. Specifically, Sertraline affects serotonin, and Lamotrigine can affect glutamate. Anesthesia affects a range of neurotransmitter systems including the GABA system. It's possible your response is in part due to the way your medication regime interacts with anaesthesia but this is speculative.\n    *   **Impact on Anesthesia Metabolism:** Your body might metabolize anesthetic drugs faster than average due to interactions with your other medications or your own individual physiology.\n\n*   **ADHD:**\n\n    *   **Stimulant-like Effects:** While you're not currently taking stimulant medication for ADHD, the underlying neurological differences associated with ADHD might play a role. Some people with ADHD have a paradoxical reaction to sedatives, meaning they become more alert instead of sleepy.\n    *   **Dopamine and Norepinephrine:** ADHD involves dysregulation of dopamine and norepinephrine, which are also involved in pain perception, arousal, and mood. Anesthesia could be affecting these systems in a unique way in your case.\n\n*   **Tourette's Syndrome:**\n\n    *   **Neurotransmitter Involvement:** Tourette's involves multiple neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. It's possible that these contribute to your unique response to anesthesia.\n    *   **Compensatory Mechanisms:** You might have developed compensatory mechanisms in your brain due to Tourette's that also influence how you experience anesthesia.\n\n*   **Genetic Factors/Individual Physiology:**\n\n    *   **Drug Metabolism Enzymes:**  Genetic variations can affect how quickly you metabolize drugs, including anesthetics. You might have a genetic profile that makes you a rapid metabolizer of certain anesthetics.\n    *   **Receptor Sensitivity:** You might have a different sensitivity to the receptors that anesthetics target.\n    *   **\"Resilience\":** Some people simply have a higher innate resilience to the effects of anesthesia and surgery.\n\n*   **Anesthesia Type and Dosage:**\n\n    *   **Specific Agents Used:** The specific types of anesthetic agents used and their dosages can greatly influence your experience. It's possible that the anesthesiologist has inadvertently used a combination that produces this effect in you.\n    *   **Awareness Under Anesthesia:**  While you aren't describing remembering the surgery, it is possible that you are emerging from anaesthesia very quickly as a result of the factors above.\n\n*   **Codeine Ineffectiveness:**\n\n    *   **CYP2D6 Enzyme:** Codeine is a prodrug, meaning it needs to be converted into morphine by the CYP2D6 enzyme in your liver to be effective. Some people have genetic variations that make this enzyme less efficient, rendering codeine ineffective. This is likely related to your specific physiology/genetics impacting drug metabolism.\n\n**Why You Don't Experience Pain Initially:**\n\n*   **Endorphins:** Surgery triggers the release of endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Your body might be producing an unusually high amount of endorphins in response to the surgery.\n*   **Adrenaline:** Adrenaline (epinephrine) is also released during surgery, which can block pain and increase alertness.\n*   **Anesthetic \"After-Effects\":** Some anesthetics have a longer-lasting effect on nerve transmission, which could temporarily block pain signals even after you wake up.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Discuss with Your Anesthesiologist:** Before your next surgery, **absolutely** bring this up with the anesthesiologist. Explain your previous experiences in detail. They can:\n    *   Adjust the anesthetic plan based on your history.\n    *   Choose specific agents that might be less likely to cause this reaction.\n    *   Consider pre-medication to manage any potential hyperactivity or anxiety.\n2.  **Pharmacogenomic Testing:** Consider asking your doctor about pharmacogenomic testing. This type of testing can identify genetic variations that affect drug metabolism, which could help explain your reactions to anesthesia, codeine, and other medications.\n3.  **Detailed Surgical and Anesthetic Records:** Keep a record of the specific anesthetic agents used, dosages, and surgical procedures you've had. This information can be valuable for future anesthesiologists.\n4.  **Medical Alert:**  If you feel strongly about this, consider wearing a medical alert bracelet or carrying a card that describes your unique response to anesthesia.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **While your experience sounds pleasant, it's important to ensure it's not masking any underlying issues.** The anesthesiologist needs to be aware so they can properly monitor you and manage your pain and recovery safely.\n*   **Don't self-medicate or change your medications before surgery.**\n*   **This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.**\n\nI hope this helps! It's great that you're curious about your body and how it responds to medical interventions. Being informed is the best way to advocate for your own health. Good luck!\n"

    "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, I understand. You're a 20-year-old female experiencing recurring abdominal pain, a persistent urge to defecate, excessive stomach gurgling, anxiety, and a delayed period. You are currently taking Keppra for epilepsy and Ventolin for asthma, and you recently stopped taking amitriptyline. You also use paracetamol for occasional migraines.\n\nGiven this complex situation, it's important to emphasize that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. However, I can offer some possible explanations and suggest steps you should take:\n\n**Possible Causes of Abdominal Pain and Bowel Urgency:**\n\n*   **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** This is a common disorder that causes abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. The feeling of needing to use the bathroom frequently is also a common symptom. Stress and anxiety often exacerbate IBS symptoms.\n*   **Anxiety and Stress:** Your statement that distress triggers anxiety attacks and that this \"also doesn't help\" is very telling. Anxiety can severely impact the digestive system, leading to pain, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, and the feeling of needing to go to the bathroom even when you don't. The gut and brain are very closely linked (the gut-brain axis).\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** Keppra can sometimes cause gastrointestinal side effects, including abdominal pain and nausea. While you've been on it for two years, side effects can sometimes appear later or change over time. Although you've stopped taking amitriptyline a week ago, withdrawal symptoms can sometimes present as abdominal pain and affect the digestive system.\n*   **Food Intolerances/Sensitivities:** You mentioned that eating sometimes made it worse and that you cut out soda and spicy foods. Other common culprits include lactose intolerance (dairy), gluten sensitivity, and FODMAPs (certain carbohydrates). Keeping a food diary can sometimes help to see if there is a link between foods and onset of the symptoms.\n*   **Infection:** A possible, but less likely, cause would be a gastrointestinal infection, even if you don't have diarrhea.\n*   **Hormonal Imbalance/Menstrual Irregularity:** The fact that your period is late could indicate hormonal fluctuations, which can also affect the digestive system.\n*   **Other less common causes:** Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, can cause abdominal pain and bowel urgency.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Doctor IMMEDIATELY:** The recurring nature of your symptoms, combined with the delayed period and your medical history, warrants a visit to your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist as soon as possible. Describe your symptoms in detail, including when they started, what makes them better or worse, and any other relevant information.\n2.  **Keep a Symptom and Food Diary:** This is crucial. Track *everything* you eat and drink, as well as the severity of your symptoms (pain, bowel urgency, gurgling, anxiety levels) throughout the day. This will help you and your doctor identify potential triggers.\n3.  **Manage Anxiety:** Since anxiety seems to be a significant factor, explore stress management techniques. Consider:\n    *   **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or other forms of therapy can help you manage anxiety and its impact on your body.\n    *   **Mindfulness and Meditation:** These practices can help calm the mind and reduce stress.\n    *   **Regular Exercise:** Exercise is a natural stress reliever.\n    *   **Deep Breathing Exercises:** Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system.\n4.  **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n5.  **Follow a Bland Diet (Temporarily):** While you're waiting to see a doctor, consider following a bland diet to ease your digestive system. This typically includes easily digestible foods like plain rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce.\n6.  **Do NOT Self-Treat:** Avoid taking over-the-counter medications for your stomach pain without consulting your doctor. Some medications can interact with your existing medications or mask underlying conditions.\n7.  **Medication Review:** Discuss your medications (Keppra and Ventolin) with your doctor to rule out any potential contributions to your symptoms. If you are concerned regarding Keppra, do NOT alter your medication as this can cause seizures.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Amitriptyline Withdrawal:** It's good that you are starting to feel better but remember that withdrawal symptoms can sometimes linger for several weeks. Your doctor should be aware of this.\n*   **Epilepsy and Stress:** Managing stress is particularly important for individuals with epilepsy, as stress can sometimes trigger seizures.\n*   **Irregular Periods:** Discuss your irregular periods with your doctor. They may recommend further evaluation to rule out any underlying hormonal imbalances.\n\nIn summary, please see a doctor as soon as possible. Document your symptoms and diet carefully. Work on managing your anxiety. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Remember, this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon.\n"

    "answer": "It's incredibly kind of you to want to support your coworker during this difficult time. It's understandable that she's upset and that waiting for answers is agonizing. I am an AI and cannot give medical advice, but I can provide general information about grey matter heterotopia. *It's important to remember that every case is different, and the information below is not a substitute for professional medical advice from their daughter's doctors.*\n\n**What is Grey Matter Heterotopia?**\n\n*   Simply put, it means \"misplaced grey matter.\" During fetal development, grey matter (which makes up the outer layer of the brain, the cortex) is supposed to migrate to its proper location. In grey matter heterotopia, some of the grey matter doesn't make it all the way and gets stuck in the wrong place, usually deeper within the brain.\n\n**Why does it cause problems?**\n\n*   The misplaced grey matter disrupts normal brain function. It can interfere with the way electrical signals travel through the brain, leading to seizures.\n*   It can also potentially affect cognitive development, learning, and other neurological functions, depending on the location and size of the heterotopia.\n\n**What are the Types of Grey Matter Heterotopia?**\n\n*   **Nodular heterotopia:** The most common type, it involves clumps of grey matter in the ventricles of the brain.\n*   **Subcortical heterotopia:** Grey matter located beneath the cortex.\n*   **Band heterotopia:** A band of grey matter that lies between the cortex and the ventricles.\n\n**How is it Diagnosed?**\n\n*   MRI is the primary tool for diagnosing grey matter heterotopia. It provides detailed images of the brain's structure.\n\n**What are the potential symptoms?**\n\n*   **Seizures:** This is the most common symptom. The type and frequency of seizures can vary.\n*   **Developmental delays:** Some children may experience delays in reaching developmental milestones.\n*   **Learning disabilities:** Difficulties with reading, writing, or math.\n*   **Cognitive impairment:** Varying degrees of cognitive challenges.\n*   **Motor problems:** In some cases, problems with coordination or movement.\n\n**What are the possible treatment options?**\n\n*   **Seizure management:**\n    *   **Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs):** The first line of treatment for controlling seizures. Many different AEDs are available, and finding the right one or combination can take time and adjustments.\n    *   **Surgery:** If medications don't control the seizures, surgery to remove or disconnect the heterotopia may be considered in some cases.\n    *   **Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS):** A device implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve, which can help reduce seizure frequency.\n    *   **Ketogenic diet:** A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that can sometimes help control seizures, especially in children.\n*   **Developmental and Educational Support:**\n    *   **Physical therapy:** To address motor skills and coordination.\n    *   **Occupational therapy:** To help with daily living skills.\n    *   **Speech therapy:** To address language and communication difficulties.\n    *   **Special education:** To provide tailored learning support.\n*   **Cognitive Therapy:**\n    *   **Cognitive rehabilitation:** To help individuals improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.\n    *   **Behavioral therapy:** To help manage behavioral issues that may arise.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Variability:** The severity of grey matter heterotopia varies widely. Some individuals have mild symptoms, while others have more significant challenges.\n*   **Individualized approach:** Treatment should be tailored to the specific individual, taking into account the type and location of the heterotopia, the severity of symptoms, and the individual's overall health.\n*   **Ongoing monitoring:** Regular follow-up with a neurologist is essential to monitor seizure control, developmental progress, and overall well-being.\n\n**What you can do to support your coworker:**\n\n*   **Listen:** Be a listening ear when she needs to talk about her feelings and concerns.\n*   **Offer practical help:** Offer to help with tasks like running errands or preparing meals.\n*   **Educate yourself:** Learning about grey matter heterotopia shows that you care and want to understand what she's going through.\n*   **Be patient:** The process of diagnosis, treatment, and adjustment can be long and challenging.\n\n**Disclaimer:** As an AI, I am not a medical professional.

    "question": "25F, 200lb, 5\u20194, asthma, current medications wellbutrin SR, vyvanse, lexapro, montelukast, spironolactone. i do not drink any alcohol, use cannabis 5-7x a weekOccasionally, I will have an intense sensation of deja vu, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as disoriented. It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down what you're experiencing. The combination of deja vu followed by nausea, dizziness, confusion, and prolonged after-effects is definitely worth exploring. While occasional deja vu is common, the accompanying symptoms you describe suggest this might be more than just a typical experience.\n\nHere's a breakdown of possibilities and what you should consider:\n\n**Potential Causes & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):** This is probably the most important thing to rule out, even though it may sound scary. TLE seizures can manifest with unusual sensory experiences, including deja vu, olfactory hallucinations (smelling things that aren't there), and feelings of unreality. The nausea, dizziness, confusion, and the \"weird\" after-effects are consistent with a possible seizure aura or a brief, partial seizure. The fact that you experienced this more frequently in childhood and now it's returning is also relevant. The ability to potentially \"control\" the progression when younger doesn't rule this out; partial seizures can sometimes be influenced by attention or distraction. The vivid dreams and the feeling that you can anticipate dream-like sequences during these episodes might point to abnormal brain activity patterns. <b>Importantly, the fact that you can sometimes anticipate the dream-like sequences suggests that this is not just a generalized anxiety attack. The dream anticipatory element suggests a physical component.**\n*   **Migraine Aura:** Some people experience migraine auras without headache. These can include sensory disturbances, dizziness, and confusion. Deja vu could potentially be part of a complex aura. However, the length of the \"weird\" feeling afterwards is a little less typical for migraine aura.\n*   **Anxiety & Panic Attacks:** While you're on medication for anxiety, and I acknowledge the presence of an anxiety disorder and acknowledge you seem to be experiencing this experience at times other than when you are anxious, intense anxiety or panic attacks can sometimes manifest with feelings of unreality and dizziness. However, the specific sequence of deja vu followed by these symptoms makes this less likely as the sole explanation.\n*   **Medication Side Effects/Interactions:** It's less likely to be a singular side effect, since you have been taking this medication for a while. But the medication you are taking can cause a variety of neurological effects, which can potentially interact.\n    *   **Wellbutrin (Bupropion):** Can lower the seizure threshold in some individuals. It can also cause dizziness and anxiety.\n    *   **Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine):** A stimulant. Stimulants can, in rare cases, trigger or exacerbate seizure activity in predisposed individuals. It can also cause anxiety, dizziness, and nausea.\n    *   **Lexapro (Escitalopram):** Can cause dizziness and nausea. While less common, it can sometimes contribute to neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Montelukast (Singulair):** Has been associated with neuropsychiatric events in some individuals.\n    *   **Spironolactone:** Can cause dizziness.\n    *   The combination of these medications together is more likely to cause side effects then when taken alone.\n*   **Dehydration/Electrolyte Imbalances:** While less likely to cause deja vu, significant dehydration can contribute to dizziness and confusion.\n*   **Cannabis Use:** While some people find cannabis relaxing, in others it can trigger anxiety, paranoia, and altered perceptions of reality. Frequent use might be contributing to the episodes or making you more susceptible.\n*   **Dissociation:** Dissociation is a feeling of detachment from reality, and it can happen alongside anxiety or stress.\n*   **Inner Ear Problems:** Problems with the inner ear can cause dizziness and disorientation. It's less likely to explain the deja vu, but it's worth considering.\n\n**What To Do:**\n\n1.  **Consult a Neurologist:** *This is the most important step.* Describe your symptoms in detail. A neurologist can order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to look for abnormal brain activity and potentially an MRI of the brain to rule out structural abnormalities. Explain the frequency, duration, and all associated symptoms. Do not be afraid to advocate for yourself and ask for this to be taken seriously.\n2.  **Medication Review:** Discuss your medications with your doctor (preferably the one prescribing the majority of these). They may want to adjust dosages or consider alternative medications to see if that makes a difference. Do *not* stop taking any medication without medical supervision.\n3.  **Track Your Episodes:** Keep a detailed log of when these episodes occur, what you were doing beforehand, your stress levels, sleep patterns, food intake, cannabis use, and anything else that might be relevant. This information can be helpful in identifying potential triggers.\n4.  **Reduce or Eliminate Cannabis Use:** Consider reducing or temporarily stopping your cannabis use to see if it has any effect on the frequency or severity of the episodes.\n5.  **Hydration & Diet:** Ensure you're adequately hydrated and maintaining a balanced diet.\n6.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize good sleep hygiene (consistent sleep schedule, dark/quiet room, etc.).\n7.  **Mental Health Support:** Continue working with your mental health provider to manage anxiety and stress. If the episodes are causing significant distress, explore coping strategies and relaxation techniques.\n\n**Why a Neurologist is Crucial:**\n\nBecause of the specific sequence of deja vu followed by other neurological symptoms, a neurological evaluation is essential to rule out TLE or other neurological conditions. Don't dismiss the possibility, even if you don't have convulsions or loss of consciousness. TLE seizures can be subtle. The fact that you were able to \"control\" it when you were younger is not necessarily an indication that this is not a neurological event.\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.*\n"

    "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's definitely worth exploring the potential connection between your weightlifting, GERD, PPI use, and fainting episodes. Here's a breakdown of how each factor could contribute, and what to discuss with your doctor:\n\n**1. Potential Role of Weightlifting and Vagus Nerve Stimulation:**\n\n*   **Vagal Response:** Weightlifting, especially heavy lifting with straining (Valsalva maneuver), can stimulate the vagus nerve. The Valsalva maneuver increases pressure in your chest, which can compress the vagus nerve. This can lead to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, resulting in lightheadedness and even fainting (vasovagal syncope).\n*   **Hiatal Hernia:** Your hiatal hernia could exacerbate this. The hernia puts pressure on the diaphragm and potentially on the vagus nerve itself, making it more susceptible to stimulation during physical exertion.\n*   **Dehydration:** Weightlifting and inadequate hydration can decrease blood volume, further increasing the risk of a vasovagal response.\n\n**2. Potential Role of GERD:**\n\n*   **Esophageal Irritation:** Acid reflux and inflammation in the esophagus can also irritate the vagus nerve.\n*   **Esophageal Spasm:**  GERD can lead to esophageal spasms, which can sometimes trigger a vagal response.\n\n**3. Potential Role of PPIs:**\n\n*   **Nutrient Absorption:** Long-term PPI use is associated with impaired absorption of certain nutrients, particularly magnesium and vitamin B12.  Magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) can affect heart rhythm and nerve function, potentially contributing to dizziness and fainting. B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms.\n*   **Bone Health:**  PPIs are also linked to reduced bone density, which can increase fracture risk if you were to fall during a fainting episode.\n*   **Gut Microbiome:** PPIs can alter the gut microbiome, potentially leading to other health issues, although a direct link to fainting is less clear.\n\n**4. Putting it all together:**\n\nIt's plausible that your weightlifting routine, combined with your hiatal hernia and possibly exacerbated by long-term PPI use, is contributing to your fainting episodes through vagal stimulation.  The Valsalva maneuver during weightlifting could be the trigger that tips the balance, especially if your vagus nerve is already sensitized due to the hiatal hernia and possible esophageal irritation. Nutrient deficiencies from long term PPI use may also be playing a role.\n\n**What to discuss with your doctor:**\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Medication Review:** A thorough review of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Specifically discuss the long-term effects of PPIs and whether a trial of weaning off them (under careful medical supervision) is appropriate.  *Do not stop taking PPIs abruptly without consulting your doctor.*\n2.  **Dietary Changes:** Discuss dietary modifications that could help manage GERD and reduce the need for PPIs, such as avoiding trigger foods (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods) and eating smaller, more frequent meals.\n3.  **Breathing Techniques:** Discuss proper breathing techniques during weightlifting. Avoiding the Valsalva maneuver can reduce pressure on the vagus nerve.  Learn techniques to exhale during the exertion phase of lifts.\n4.  **Hydration:** Ensure adequate hydration, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n5.  **Exercise Modifications:**  Consider modifying your weightlifting routine:\n    *   Reduce weight and focus on proper form.\n    *   Avoid exercises that cause significant straining.\n    *   Consider shorter, more frequent workouts.\n    *   Ensure adequate warm-up and cool-down periods.\n6.  **Blood Tests:** Ask your doctor about blood tests to check for nutrient deficiencies (magnesium, B12, iron) and electrolyte imbalances.\n7.  **Re-evaluate Epilepsy Diagnosis:** Given the conflicting neurology opinions, consider getting a third opinion from a neurologist who specializes in syncope (fainting).  A detailed history focusing on triggers (weightlifting, Valsalva, meals) is crucial.\n8.  **Further Cardiac Evaluation:** While previous cardiac tests were negative, it might be worth discussing repeat or more advanced testing (e.g., ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise stress test with blood pressure monitoring) to rule out any subtle cardiac issues that might be triggered by exercise.\n9.  **GI Evaluation:** Consider further evaluation of your hiatal hernia with an upper endoscopy and esophageal manometry to assess the severity of GERD and esophageal function.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Do not self-treat:** This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. It's essential to consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n*   **Safety First:**  Avoid exercising alone, especially when lifting heavy weights.  Have someone spot you, and let them know about your history of fainting.\n*   **Keep a Log:** Keep a detailed log of your workouts, diet, medications, and any symptoms (lightheadedness, palpitations, etc.) to help identify potential triggers.\n\nBy working closely with your healthcare team and thoroughly investigating these possibilities, you can hopefully identify the cause of your fainting episodes and develop a safe and effective management plan.\n"

    "question": "29F, height 165cm, weight 74kg, caucasian. I do not smoke or have regular dairy. Weekly alcohol consumption would be 2-7 standard drinks per week at most.  also regularly have lean meat and 3 veg for lunch and dinner and a fruit smoothie for breakfast.

I have a history of treating my anxiety with alcohol and fast food but over the last 8 years or so (since my early 20's) I've gone to therapy and gotten it really well under control. I never had these symptoms before when I had unhealthy habits but over the last year my pancreas has not been having a good time. Every month or 2 I get these very specific pains that I now know is mild chronic pancreatitis. It's never brought on by a change in routine, it's always random.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Okay, thanks for providing that detailed information. It gives a good picture of your overall health and recent concerns.  It sounds like you're proactively managing your health and have made significant positive changes over the years, which is commendable.\n\nLet's break down the key elements and potential areas to consider, keeping in mind that **this is not a substitute for professional medical advice and you need to discuss this with your gastroenterologist and neurologist**:\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n*   **Epilepsy and Keppra:**  Keppra (levetiracetam) is generally well-tolerated, but it's always good to be aware of potential side effects. It's unlikely to be directly causing pancreatic issues, but discuss this possibility with your neurologist to confirm.\n*   **Mild Chronic Pancreatitis:** This is the primary concern. A lipase level consistently between 70-100 U/L, despite your healthy diet and lifestyle, warrants investigation.  The goal is to identify the underlying cause to prevent progression.\n*   **Diet:** Your current diet of lean meat, 3 veg, and fruit smoothie is generally very healthy.\n*   **Alcohol:** Your alcohol consumption is low to moderate.\n*   **Weight:** You are classified as overweight.\n*   **Anxiety History:** While your anxiety is well-managed now, the previous unhealthy coping mechanisms (alcohol and fast food) *could* have contributed to some long-term effects, although it's less likely since you've maintained a healthy lifestyle for so long.\n\n**Possible Factors Contributing to Pancreatitis (to Discuss with Your Doctor)**\n\nHere are some factors you should ask about:\n\n*   **Gallstones/Biliary Issues:** Even small gallstones or sludge can intermittently block the pancreatic duct, causing inflammation. **This is one of the most common causes of pancreatitis.** Ask about imaging specifically looking at the gallbladder and bile ducts (e.g., ultrasound, MRCP).\n*   **Medications:**  Review *all* your medications (including over-the-counter and supplements) with your doctor. While Keppra is less likely, some medications *can* contribute to pancreatitis.\n*   **Autoimmune Conditions:**  Pancreatitis can sometimes be associated with autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis).\n*   **Hereditary Pancreatitis:** Although less common, this should be considered, especially if there's any family history of pancreatic problems. Genetic testing might be an option.\n*   **Structural Abnormalities:**  Rarely, anatomical issues in the pancreatic duct or surrounding structures can cause problems.\n*   **Triglycerides:**  High triglycerides can cause pancreatitis, but you haven't mentioned anything about them.\n*   **Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction:** The sphincter of Oddi controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juices into the small intestine.  If it malfunctions, it can cause back pressure and pancreatitis. This is difficult to diagnose.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Gastroenterologist**\n\nMake sure to ask your gastroenterologist about the following:\n\n1.  **What specific investigations are planned to determine the cause of my elevated lipase?** (Push for specifics about imaging, blood tests, etc.)\n2.  **What is the likelihood of each potential cause (gallstones, medications, autoimmune, hereditary, structural)?**\n3.  **If no clear cause is found (idiopathic pancreatitis), what is the long-term management plan?** (Dietary recommendations, monitoring frequency, pain management strategies)\n4.  **What specific dietary modifications, if any, should I make?**\n5.  **How will my weight affect my condition?**\n6.  **Is there a way I can track my symptoms so you can get an idea about how random the events are?**\n\n**Things You Can Do Now**\n\n*   **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Start meticulously tracking your symptoms.  Include:\n    *   Date and time of pain onset\n    *   Location of pain (be specific)\n    *   Intensity of pain (scale of 1-10)\n    *   Duration of pain\n    *   What you were doing/eating in the hours *before* the pain started\n    *   Any other associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, bloating, changes in bowel habits)\n    *   What, if anything, relieves the pain\n*   **Continue Healthy Habits:** Maintain your healthy diet, moderate alcohol intake, regular exercise, and stress management techniques.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n*   **Low-Fat Diet:** Even though your diet is already generally healthy, consider temporarily focusing on a *very* low-fat diet, especially in the days leading up to your gastroenterology appointment. This can help reduce pancreatic stimulation.\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Stress/Anxiety**\n\nEven though you've addressed your anxiety with therapy, chronic pain and uncertainty about a medical condition can naturally increase stress levels.  Explore relaxation techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or yoga. These can help manage stress and potentially reduce the frequency or severity of your pancreatitis episodes.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** You are doing a great job managing your health and taking proactive steps to address your symptoms. The key is to work closely with your gastroenterologist to identify the underlying cause of your elevated lipase and recurrent pancreatitis and develop a tailored management plan. Be persistent in asking questions and advocating for yourself. Good luck!\n"
