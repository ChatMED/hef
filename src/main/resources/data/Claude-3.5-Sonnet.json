    "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your situation, here are some points to consider and suggestions:\n\n1. Post-seizure sensitivity:\n- Even if the initial seizure was medication-related, you might be temporarily more sensitive to certain stimuli\n- Your brain might need more time to fully recover\n\n2. Anxiety and dissociation:\n- These conditions can make you more hyperaware of physical sensations\n- They can also cause dizziness and disorientation on their own\n- Gaming can increase anxiety levels in some people\n\n3. Practical suggestions:\n- Take regular breaks (every 20-30 minutes)\n- Ensure proper lighting in your gaming area\n- Adjust screen brightness and contrast\n- Maintain proper distance from the screen\n- Enable blue light filters\n- Stay well-hydrated\n- Get adequate sleep\n\n4. Gaming modifications:\n- Reduce game settings that involve intense flashing\n- Lower graphics settings\n- Consider playing less intense games temporarily\n- Monitor your symptoms and keep a log\n\n5. Professional support:\n- Continue working with your healthcare providers\n- Consider seeing an eye doctor to rule out vision issues\n- Work with a mental health professional for anxiety management\n\nRemember to stop gaming and rest if you experience any concerning symptoms. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult your healthcare providers again."

    "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your description, these episodes sound like seizures, and having two or more unprovoked seizures typically meets the clinical definition of epilepsy. However, several points are worth noting:\n\n1. Potential Triggers:\n- First episode: Combination of temperature shock (cold water/hot weather), sleep deprivation, and alcohol\n- Second episode: Recent cannabis use, possible stress/excitement from celebrations\n\n2. Important Clinical Factors:\n- Normal test results (EEG, MRI, CT, blood work)\n- Prescription of Lamotrigin (an anticonvulsant medication)\n- Loss of consciousness\n- Post-ictal confusion (confusion after the seizure)\n- Tongue biting (a common seizure sign)\n\nThe fact that you've been prescribed Lamotrigin suggests your neurologist considers these episodes serious enough to warrant anticonvulsant treatment.\n\nWhile this could be classified as epilepsy, it might also be:\n- Provoked seizures (due to specific triggers)\n- Non-epileptic seizures\n- Syncope with seizure-like activity\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Continue taking prescribed medication\n2. Maintain regular neurologist visits\n3. Avoid potential triggers\n4. Keep a detailed seizure diary\n5. Consider getting a second neurological opinion\n\nThis medical information is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please continue working with your healthcare providers for proper diagnosis and treatment."

    "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your concerns and questions are valid. Here's some key information about epilepsy diagnosis:\n\n1. Traditional Diagnosis Criteria:\n- Typically requires two or more unprovoked seizures\n- Or one seizure with a high risk of recurrence\n- The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provides these guidelines\n\n2. EEG Findings:\n- Can show epileptiform discharges (specific electrical patterns)\n- Abnormal EEG alone doesn't automatically mean epilepsy\n- Normal EEG doesn't rule out epilepsy either\n- Some people with epilepsy have normal EEGs between seizures\n\n3. Questions to Ask:\n- What specific EEG patterns led to diagnosis?\n- What's the risk of recurrence?\n- Are there other potential causes being considered?\n- What type of epilepsy is suspected?\n\nIt's reasonable to:\n- Seek a second opinion\n- Ask for detailed explanation of EEG findings\n- Discuss treatment options and their necessity\n- Request copies of test results\n\nConsider documenting:\n- Any potential seizure triggers\n- Family history\n- Other symptoms\n- Complete medical history\n\nRemember that medical decisions should be made in partnership with healthcare providers."

    "answer": "While I understand your desire to help by donating plasma, I can explain some of the general considerations regarding epilepsy and plasma donation:\n\nCommon reasons for deferral include:\n- Risk of seizure during donation process\n- Concern about medication levels in plasma\n- Some facilities' specific policies regarding neurological conditions\n\nHowever, policies can vary by donation center and country. The best course of action would be to:\n1. Discuss with your neurologist\n2. Get documentation of your controlled condition\n3. Contact different plasma centers about their specific policies\n\nThis isn't medical advice - just general information.

    "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I\u2019ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I\u2019m seeing that I haven\u2019t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I\u2019m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I\u2019d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it\u2019s important to me to know when it\u2019s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your seizure history is still medically relevant and should be disclosed on medical forms, even though you've been seizure-free since your surgery. Here's why:\n\n1. Medical professionals need to know about:\n- Past brain surgery\n- Missing/altered brain tissue (hippocampus)\n- Potential medication interactions\n- Possible contraindications for certain treatments\n\n2. Documentation helps protect you:\n- Some medications can lower seizure threshold\n- Certain medical procedures may need modification\n- Emergency responders benefit from knowing your history\n\n3. Legal/Administrative considerations:\n- Being transparent helps avoid issues like the DMV situation\n- Medical records consistency is important\n- Insurance coverage could be affected by non-disclosure\n\nHowever, you can clarify that:\n- You're seizure-free since surgery\n- You don't require anti-epileptic medications\n- You have medical clearance for activities like driving\n\nWhen specifically relevant:\n- Medical procedures\n- New medications\n- Anesthesia\n- High-risk activities\n- Insurance/legal documentation\n\nConsider having a brief written medical history to share when needed, including surgery date and seizure-free status."

    "question": "My partner (20M) has been having these \u2018seizure-like\u2019 behaviours for as long as he can remember (so assuming his whole life). There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This pattern is common in people with epilepsy due to several factors:\n\n1. Sleep-wake cycle influence:\n- The transition between sleep and wakefulness is a vulnerable period for seizures\n- Changes in brain activity patterns during these transitions can trigger seizures\n- Many people experience seizures specifically during wake-up times\n\n2. Circadian rhythm effects:\n- Your body's internal clock affects hormone levels and brain activity\n- Certain times of day may be more seizure-prone\n- Morning hours often have higher seizure risk\n\n3. Sleep deprivation:\n- Being tired lowers your seizure threshold\n- Lack of sleep makes your brain more excitable\n- Fatigue can trigger abnormal neuronal firing\n\n4. Stress hormones:\n- Cortisol levels are naturally highest in the morning\n- These hormones can affect brain excitability\n- The combination of hormones and fatigue increases seizure risk\n\nManaging this might involve:\n- Maintaining consistent sleep schedules\n- Avoiding sleep deprivation\n- Taking medications at strategic times\n- Working with your doctor to adjust treatment timing"

I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out.

    "question": "I have 2 conditions(?) i want to mention, the second being (in my opinion) more severe than the first.the first is something ive noticed more recently. im not sure how long its been going on. i got an apple watch in december, which is the first heart rate tracking device ive owned. ive been using it to occasionally measure my heartrate, and ive noticed that my resting heart rate lies anywhere from 20-50 or 60 bpm lower than my standing heart rate. for a while, immediately upon standing i would become dizzy and my vision would fade a little, and i would see spots. this usually clears up after around 10 seconds 20 seconds at the most. ive seen a lot of resources about pots but i dont and have never fainted or started sweating due to standing the second is something i can give a lot more details on. ive been calling these \"blackouts\" but thats not medically accurate. it usually starts with me feeling unusually sick for a bit, then suddenly, the sickness symptoms will instantly disappear and my hearing will muffle greatly, and my ears will start ringing, but the ringing is also muffled. then, my field of vision will begin to tunnel, gradually getting smaller and smaller, until it becomes completely black, at which point i lose all recollection of what im doing, im basically acting without being conscious.these started when i was 8 and have happened every few years or so since, with them gradually getting worse and worse. the first time it happened, it was just slight lightheadedness and nausea, then muffled hearing and my vision partially tunneling, but not going all the way. this more recent time a little less than 2 years ago, however, i felt extremely nauseous, i felt extremely cold yet i was sweating profusely, i think i might have had a headache too i cant fully remember. i felt like i was gonna die before the \"blackout\" even started and the muffled hearing started. when i fully blacked out and lost consciousness (while still controlling my body, like a zombie in a sense), i have no idea how long i was out for, and i only was brought back to reality when i felt water hit my foot after i knocked over a pitcher.ive done a lot of research on this specifically and the closest thing ive found has been transient ischemic attacks. im not fully sure if this is a tia though, especially because i cant recall weakness in one side of my body at any time during one of these, but that might be because my memory during these events isnt really the best. additionally, my moms biological mom had several strokes before dying of another stroke, which could make me more predisposed to strokes, but again im not entirely sure. ive also gotten results for certain types of epilepsy, but i never looked too deep into them so that may not be validthe reason i bring these two afflictions up together is because maybe im missing something? maybe these are both signs of a rare illness or something? maybe theyre two different things that are co morbid? they may have nothing to do with each other at all though, i just want to include anything i can think of some other things i have are a heat sensitivity (not sure if this is the correct term, but basically i just get really really hot for no reason and cant cool off until i put cold water on my body), as well as sweating a lot, like ill be cold and still sweating. not sure if these have anything to do with the above but im adding it here just in case.if you have any questions feel free to ask, theres something i may have forgotten to add here. also im sorry about the length, i have a tendency to explain things with a lot more words than are needed",

    "answer": "Your symptoms warrant medical attention, especially the \"blackout\" episodes. Here's a breakdown:\n\nFirst condition:\n- Large difference between resting and standing heart rate\n- Dizziness upon standing\n- Visual disturbances\nThese symptoms suggest orthostatic hypotension or POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), even without fainting.\n\nSecond condition (\"blackouts\"):\n- Progressive symptoms starting with nausea\n- Muffled hearing/ringing\n- Tunnel vision leading to blackout\n- Continued movement without consciousness\n- Cold feeling with profuse sweating\nThese could be:\n- Seizures\n- Vasovagal syncope\n- TIAs (though less likely given your age)\n- Complex migraine episodes\n\nThe heat sensitivity and sweating could be related to autonomic dysfunction, which can also cause orthostatic problems.\n\nGiven your family history of strokes and the progressive nature of these episodes, you should:\n1. See a neurologist\n2. Get a full cardiovascular workup\n3. Consider wearing a heart monitor\n4.

I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the description, this sounds more like a vasovagal syncope (fainting) episode rather than an epileptic seizure. Here's why:\n\n1. The scenario includes classic triggers for vasovagal syncope:\n- Hyperventilation (can reduce blood flow to brain)\n- Standing up (orthostatic hypotension)\n- Your relatively low blood pressure (55/110) could make you more susceptible\n\n2. The brief involuntary movements you experienced are likely myoclonic jerks, which are common during fainting and don't necessarily indicate a seizure. These are called convulsive syncope.\n\n3. The short duration (10 seconds) and quick recovery with some fogginess is more typical of fainting than a seizure.\n\nHowever, given your family history of epilepsy, it would be prudent to:\n1. Consult your doctor about this episode\n2. Get a proper medical evaluation\n3. Consider monitoring your blood pressure\n\nUntil you see a doctor:\n- Avoid sudden position changes\n- Stay well-hydrated\n- Be mindful of breathing patterns\n- Sit or lie down if you feel lightheaded\n\nThis is not a definitive diagnosis, and medical evaluation is recommended for proper assessment."

    "question": "I (30F) had a seizure for the first time 3 days ago. I had had a couple beers, smoked a joint, and did some shrooms (none of which is unusual for me). I have no family history of epilepsy, and am in generally good health.I was checked out by paramedics immediately after the seizure who said I looked fine and it was probably from the shrooms. I went to my PCP the next day and she ordered a couple blood tests which all came back normal. I am waiting for brain imaging to be approved by my insurance.Now it\u2019s three days later and I still feel exhausted and weak and slow. I could barely get through my workday today. Is this normal? Is extreme fatigue indicative of something?Also I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant at all but about a month ago I started experiencing extreme nausea to the point I was calling off sick at work, vomiting in the middle of the day, and had just had a doctors appointment to discuss that the week before.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand your concern about these symptoms. Post-seizure fatigue and weakness (also called the post-ictal state) can indeed last for several days, so what you're experiencing isn't unusual. However, there are several important points to consider:\n\n1. Post-seizure symptoms typically include:\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Confusion\n- Weakness\n- Headache\n- Memory issues\n- Muscle soreness\n\n2. The combination of substances you took could have contributed to the seizure:\n- Alcohol\n- Cannabis\n- Psilocybin mushrooms\nThese can lower seizure threshold when combined\n\n3. The previous month's nausea could be relevant and might need further investigation, as it could indicate:\n- An underlying condition\n- Medication side effects\n- Other medical issues\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Follow up with your neurological imaging as planned\n2. Consider temporarily avoiding recreational substances\n3. Keep a symptom diary\n4. Seek immediate medical attention if you have another seizure\n\nIf your fatigue persists beyond a week or worsens, consult your doctor again. They might need to adjust their evaluation based on your ongoing symptoms."

    "question": "33f/5\u20193\u201d/185lbs/no major health issuesWhat I\u2019ve been experiencing: Out of nowhere my eyes get super sensitive to light. I will get an overwhelming sensation of doom/panic. My body basically forgets how to breathe. Heart rate goes up. My brain feels weird, dizzy, and fuzzy. I get hot and nauseous. I just don\u2019t feel ok, something in my head just feels very off and I\u2019m scared. These episodes last for a few seconds to a few minutes. I don\u2019t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it\u2019s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It\u2019s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn\u2019t the same feeling. I\u2019ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn\u2019t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area. At night when I try to sleep it sometimes it feels like my eyes and brain are about to move side to side\u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a box and someone is shaking it diagonally. Makes me dizzy as all hell and my body feels it too. That has happened a handful of times in my life in the past and I went years without it happening and it\u2019s back, and it\u2019s scary and feels horrible. Shaking my head hard helps stop it when I feel it coming on.Does what I\u2019m experiencing sound like focal seizure/epilepsy? I\u2019m really nervous about this. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s all because of the trazodone or if I had this since I was a kid (since I\u2019ve experienced that weird shaking in a box sensation multiple times through my life) and the trazodone made it all come to the surface?Meds I take: klonopin 1mg, vitamin d, probiotic, melatonin 2mg, trazodone 25mg.",

My question is why would he describe the EEG as \u2018essentially normal\u2019 rather than just normal?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "The term \"essentially normal\" in EEG reporting is a nuanced way of describing an EEG that is predominantly normal but may have some minor variations or findings that don't reach the threshold of being definitively abnormal or clinically significant. There are several possible reasons for this terminology:\n\n1. Minor variations from perfect normality that are:\n- Within normal physiological limits\n- Of questionable clinical significance\n- Not clearly epileptiform\n\n2. Presence of:\n- Subtle asymmetries\n- Mild background changes\n- Occasional non-specific changes\n- Benign variants that don't indicate pathology\n\n3. Technical factors:\n- Some artifacts that make complete interpretation challenging\n- Sections of recording that weren't optimal quality\n\nIt's worth noting that:\n- EEGs can be normal even in people with epilepsy\n- Up to 50% of people with epilepsy may have a normal routine EEG\n- Seizures need to be occurring during the EEG to capture definitive epileptiform activity\n\nConsider asking your neurologist for clarification about specific findings that led to the \"essentially normal\" description rather than simply \"normal.\""

    "question": "I want to donate plasma, partially because I have O negative blood and would be available every 4 weeks to donate. And partially because I discovered donating plasma also has health benefits for the donors such as reducing micro-plastics in the body.From what I can see online in the UK if you\u2019re epileptic you can\u2019t donate plasma/blood. I was wondering if anyone knew the reason for this? Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a \u2018we\u2019re worried you may have a seizure while donating\u2019 kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it\u2019s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn\u2019t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can\u2019t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "The restriction on blood and plasma donation for people with epilepsy in the UK is primarily based on two main concerns:\n\n1. Safety during donation:\n- There is a risk of having a seizure during the donation process\n- This could be dangerous both for the donor and potentially damage equipment\n- The donation process can be stressful on the body, which could potentially trigger seizures\n\n2. Medication concerns:\n- Anti-epileptic medications (like Keppra and Eslicarbazepine) remain in the blood/plasma\n- These medications could potentially affect recipients, especially vulnerable ones\n- There's also concern about maintaining consistent medication levels in your own system\n\nWhile your O negative status would indeed make you a valuable donor, current UK guidelines maintain this restriction for safety reasons. However, medical guidelines do change over time with new research and evidence. You could:\n\n1. Discuss this with your neurologist\n2. Contact NHS Blood and Transplant directly for more specific information\n3. Consider other ways to help, such as encouraging eligible donors or volunteering\n\nThe primary focus is on both donor and recipient safety, rather than just the medication aspect."

She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",

    "answer": "This situation definitely requires medical attention. Here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. Pregnancy-related seizures can be a sign of serious conditions like:\n- Eclampsia (though usually occurs later in pregnancy)\n- Electrolyte imbalances (the low magnesium could be relevant)\n- Blood pressure issues\n- Blood clotting disorders\n\n2. Her previous sepsis history could be relevant and should be mentioned to all healthcare providers.\n\n3. The symptoms you describe (confusion, amnesia, dizziness) could be related to:\n- Non-epileptic seizures (PNES)\n- Syncope (fainting episodes)\n- Anxiety attacks\n- Sleep disorders\n\nAdvice:\n1. She should seek a second medical opinion, preferably from a neurologist who specializes in pregnancy cases\n\n2. Document all episodes (time, duration, symptoms, triggers)\n\n3. If possible, have someone video record an episode to show doctors\n\n4. Ensure she's getting regular prenatal care\n\n5. Monitor magnesium levels and take supplements if prescribed\n\n6.

Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the information you've provided, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Regarding the lesion:\n- Lesions can sometimes appear differently on different MRI scans due to:\n  * Different imaging techniques or equipment\n  * Changes in inflammation\n  * Natural healing processes\n  * Resolution of initial injury\n\n2. About your seizures:\n- The increase in seizure frequency with missed medication doesn't necessarily correlate with lesion size\n- Your brain may have developed increased dependency on the medication for seizure control\n- This is common with long-term anticonvulsant use\n\n3. Important considerations:\n- Even if the lesion appears smaller, the surrounding brain tissue may still be prone to seizure activity\n- Seizure disorders can become established independent of the initial cause\n- The brain can develop new neural pathways that maintain seizure susceptibility\n\nIt would be best to:\n1. Discuss these concerns with your neurologist\n2. Keep taking your medications as prescribed\n3. Don't assume fewer visible lesions means you can stop treatment\n\nRemember: Even if a lesion shrinks, this doesn't automatically mean seizures will stop, as the brain may have developed established seizure patterns."

It started with me just getting vertigo in 2019 and it went away with medication but came back within a week and i got chest pains and went to see a cardiologist and everything was okay. I was then sent to a neurologist and they finally diagnosed me with epilepsy but I don't have seizures. for awhile though i was having episodes of \"falling into the ground\" feelings and if i was in the car it would feel like i was falling back. I would just get odd feelings like that. i was told i basically have micro seizures. there's times where i get dizzy and don't feel good or just don't feel right and im guessing it could just be depersonalization but I'm honestly not sure. l've been now struggling with a migraine for over a month now and i had a mri done that came out normal and im having another one and a mra done tomorrow to see if something looks off.

Your symptoms seem to have some overlap between conditions:\n- Vertigo can be related to both neurological issues and migraine auras\n- The \"falling\" sensation could be related to both vertigo and seizure activity\n- Depersonalization can be connected to both BPD and anxiety\n\n2. Regarding your current migraine situation:\n- Chronic migraines (lasting >15 days) need specialized attention\n- The combination of Topamate (migraine prevention) and Aimovig (CGRP inhibitor) is appropriate\n- The upcoming MRA is a good step to rule out vascular issues\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1. Consider keeping a detailed symptom diary to help identify triggers and patterns\n\n2. Ask your neurologist about:\n- Whether your medications might be interacting\n- If the current migraine could be medication overuse headache\n- The possibility of adding preventive treatments\n\n3.

My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying.

All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This sounds like it could be \"ice cream headache syncope\" or \"cold-stimulus headache syncope,\" which is a documented phenomenon where consuming cold foods (especially ice cream) can trigger fainting (syncope) and sometimes seizure-like activity. Here are some key points:\n\n1. The vagus nerve can be stimulated by sudden cold exposure to the palate/throat, causing:\n- Drop in heart rate\n- Drop in blood pressure\n- Fainting (syncope)\n- Sometimes brief seizure-like activity (convulsive syncope)\n\n2. Brain freeze (sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia) can trigger a similar response in some people.\n\n3. This condition is considered benign but should be evaluated by a neurologist and/or cardiologist to rule out other conditions:\n- Cardiac arrhythmias\n- Epilepsy\n- Other neurological conditions\n\n4. Having a pattern of episodes triggered by ice cream consumption supports this diagnosis.\n\nRecommend:\n1. Follow up with a pediatric neurologist\n2. Consider cardiac evaluation\n3.

    "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your description, there are several potential explanations for your symptoms:\n\n1. Exercise-Induced Syncope:\n- The combination of physical exertion (particularly upper body exercises like pull-ups) and the Valsalva maneuver (holding breath while straining) can cause blood pressure changes leading to syncope.\n\n2. Vagal Response:\n- Your theory about the vagus nerve is plausible. The hiatal hernia could potentially irritate or compress the vagus nerve, especially during exercises that increase intra-abdominal pressure.\n- Pull-ups particularly could exacerbate this due to the position and strain involved.\n\n3. PPI-Related Issues:\n- Long-term PPI use can lead to:\n  * Magnesium deficiency\n  * B12 deficiency\n  * Iron deficiency\nThese deficiencies could contribute to dizziness and fainting episodes.\n\n4. Situational Syncope:\n- The specific body position during pull-ups, combined with the hernia and physical strain, might create a \"perfect storm\" for triggering episodes.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Consider getting tested for nutrient deficiencies if you haven't already\n2. Discuss alternative GERD treatments with your doctor\n3. If you want to return to pull-ups, consider:\n   - Modified versions\n   - Gradual progression\n   - Working with a physical therapist\n\nThe resolution of symptoms after stopping pull-ups suggests a mechanical/positional component rather than a primary neurological or cardiac issue.\n\nThis is informational only - please consult with healthcare providers for medical advice."

    "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",

    "answer": "Based on the symptoms described and their immediate resolution upon moving, this strongly suggests there may have been environmental issues in the basement suite, with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure being a leading possibility. Other potential environmental hazards could include:\n\n1. Carbon Monoxide - A colorless, odorless gas that can cause nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms\n2. Mold/Fungi - Some types can cause similar symptoms\n3. Radon gas - More common in basements\n4. Sewer gas leaks\n5. Other toxic fumes from nearby materials or systems\n\nThe fact that all three occupants (two humans and a cat) experienced similar symptoms that resolved immediately upon leaving suggests an environmental cause rather than individual medical conditions.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Report concerns to the property owner/manager\n2. Contact local health department\n3. Consider having the property inspected for environmental hazards\n4. Document everything in case future legal action is needed\n5. Inform current/future tenants of potential risks\n\nThe immediate cessation of symptoms for all occupants upon moving strongly indicates there was likely a serious environmental health hazard in that basement suite that should be investigated to protect future occupants."

    "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This situation requires medical attention, even if symptoms are improving. While I can't diagnose you, here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. The combination of substances you took (alcohol, kratom, THC, and fluoxetine) could have potentially triggered serotonin syndrome, but ongoing symptoms for two months would be unusual for acute serotonin syndrome.\n\n2. Myoclonus and brain zaps can be related to:\n- SSRI discontinuation\n- Medication interactions\n- Neurological conditions\n- Sleep disorders\n- Anxiety\n\n3. It's unlikely you \"gave yourself epilepsy\" from one incident, as epilepsy typically has different causes and presentations.\n\nYou should seek medical attention because:\n- Symptoms have persisted for 2 months\n- You're experiencing cognitive effects (loss of focus)\n- The cause needs to be properly diagnosed\n- You need proper monitoring and potentially treatment\n\nWhile waiting for a GP appointment, consider:\n- Urgent care if symptoms worsen\n- Avoiding triggers (caffeine, sleep deprivation)\n- Documenting frequency and severity of symptoms\n- Being completely honest with healthcare providers about substance use\n\nDon't delay seeking care due to shame about substance use - doctors need accurate information to help you properly."

    "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your description, hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) could indeed be a potential explanation for your symptoms, particularly given your history of brain surgery. AVMs and their surgical removal can affect surrounding brain tissue, including areas that control motor function.\n\nSome key points to consider:\n\n1. Your symptoms are consistent with mild hemiparesis:\n- One-sided weakness\n- More noticeable during strenuous activities\n- Affects specific muscle groups\n- Trembling and fatigue with repetitive movements\n\nPotential approaches:\n\n1. Physical Therapy:\n- Specialized exercises to strengthen affected muscles\n- Balance and coordination training\n- Progressive resistance training\n\n2. Occupational Therapy:\n- Techniques to improve muscle control\n- Adaptive strategies for strength training\n\n3. Neurological Rehabilitation:\n- Programs specifically designed for brain injury recovery\n- May help improve neural pathways\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Consult with:\n- A physical therapist experienced in neurological conditions\n- A sports medicine specialist\n- A rehabilitation specialist\n\n2. Consider:\n- Starting with very light weights\n- Using resistance bands\n- Focusing on isometric exercises\n- Modified exercise techniques\n\nIt would be advisable to get a comprehensive evaluation to determine the exact cause and best treatment approach for your condition."

I had just gotten off birth control to try and heal my body naturally. my seizures seem to align with my menstrual cycle. I\u2019m on Keppra and it\u2019s controlling my tonic clonic seizures but I have breakthrough absence seizures 3x a week. originally my first EEG only showed right temporal lobe seizures but my most recent EEG showed right and left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe seizures.while I was in the epilepsy monitoring unit last week for a 7 day EEG during a pretty intense grand mal seizure my heart rate hit 275 bpm. I\u2019ve always felt little heart flutters but this was intense. I have a Holter monitor now, and I was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. I\u2019m getting an ablation next week. the flutters happen after every seizure but sometimes just on their own without seizure activity.can someone please help me connect the dots, or point me in the direction of someone who can help?

Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs. Also have had gastrointestinal issues which i\u2019m not sure if they are relevant or not: nausea and stomach pain after eating anything. Have had some issues with UTI\u2019s.

The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been.

Drug Interactions:\n- The combination of antidepressants (Wellbutrin, Venlafaxine) with cannabis can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome and adverse reactions\n- These medications can also intensify anxiety and paranoia when combined with THC\n\n2. Your symptoms suggest:\n- Possible serotonin syndrome\n- Post-traumatic stress from the bad cannabis experience\n- Potential medication side effects\n- Possible underlying conditions that need attention\n\nImportant recommendations:\n\n1. Seek immediate medical attention if you:\n- Continue having hallucinations\n- Experience worsening suicidal thoughts\n- Have severe physical symptoms\n\n2. Consider:\n- Getting a second opinion from another psychiatrist\n- Requesting a complete medical evaluation\n- Being completely honest about all substance use with your healthcare providers\n\n3. For immediate support:\n- Contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988)\n- Have someone stay with you if you're feeling unsafe\n- Visit the nearest emergency room if symptoms become severe\n\nDon't ignore these symptoms - they're serious and deserve proper medical attention. Your current psychiatrist's response seems inadequate given the severity of your symptoms."

    "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",

    "answer": "Based on your description, it would be very reasonable to discuss these symptoms with a neurologist, as several of them could indeed be consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or other seizure disorders:\n\n1. The sensory phenomena you describe (tastes, smells) could be consistent with simple partial seizures\n2. The brief episodes of euphoria could be temporal lobe seizures\n3. The dissociative episodes could be seizure activity\n4. The \"dream-like states\" with post-episode confusion and exhaustion could be complex partial seizures\n5. The \"buzzing\" sensation and involuntary movements during sleep could be seizure activity\n\nSome important factors that make this worth investigating:\n- Family history of epilepsy\n- Symptoms starting in childhood\n- Multiple types of episodes\n- Connection to sleep/fatigue\n- Episodes of altered consciousness\n- Post-episode confusion and memory loss\n\nWhen you see your doctor, try to provide:\n- Detailed descriptions of episodes\n- Frequency of occurrences\n- Any patterns you've noticed\n- Family history details\n- Timeline of symptoms\n\nThey may recommend:\n- EEG (possibly including sleep study)\n- MRI\n- Neurological examination\n- Referral to a neurologist\n\nYou're definitely not overthinking this - these symptoms warrant professional evaluation."

    "answer": "Based on your description, this sounds more like a vasovagal syncope (fainting) episode rather than a seizure or serotonin syndrome. The combination of:\n- Not eating properly\n- Smoking cannabis (which can lower blood pressure)\n- New medication\nlikely contributed to this episode.\n\nHowever, since you're on multiple medications that affect serotonin, you should:\n1. Contact your prescribing doctor to report this incident\n2. Start eating regular meals\n3. Be cautious with cannabis use while adjusting to new medications\n4. Monitor for any serotonin syndrome symptoms (confusion, agitation, high fever, heavy sweating, tremors)\n\nWhile this doesn't seem like a typical seizure or serotonin syndrome episode, it's always better to be safe and have your healthcare provider evaluate the situation, especially with recent medication changes.\n\nUntil you can speak with your doctor, make sure to:\n- Eat regular meals\n- Stay hydrated\n- Consider taking a break from cannabis\n- Have someone with you when smoking"

    "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand your frustration with this complex situation. Here are some potential factors that might explain why things have gotten worse:\n\n1. Abrupt medication changes:\n- Switching between medications without proper tapering\n- The very low initial Lamotrigine dose (25mg) was likely insufficient\n- Stopping Keppra suddenly can trigger seizures\n\n2. Sleep issues:\n- Sleep deprivation is a major seizure trigger\n- Your seizures seem particularly linked to sleep problems\n- This can create a difficult cycle where seizures affect sleep, and poor sleep triggers more seizures\n\n3. Possible mismanagement:\n- Lack of recognition of myoclonic seizures as legitimate seizure activity\n- Inadequate communication between healthcare providers\n- Premature discontinuation of medication despite ongoing symptoms\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Find a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy (epileptologist)\n2. Keep a detailed seizure diary\n3. Maintain consistent sleep patterns\n4. Don't make medication changes without medical supervision\n5. Consider getting a second opinion\n\nPlease continue working with healthcare providers to find the right treatment plan. Consider seeking an epilepsy specialist who better understands your specific type of epilepsy."

    "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",

Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is a valid medical concern and your symptoms are consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), particularly what are known as focal aware seizures or auras. Key points about your symptoms:\n\n1. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, nausea, and head sensations are common symptoms of temporal lobe seizures\n2. The episodic nature (clusters followed by periods of nothing) is typical\n3. The short duration (under 10 minutes) is consistent\n4. Keeping logs is excellent and will be helpful for medical professionals\n\nRecommendations:\n- See a neurologist specifically (not just a general doctor)\n- Bring your symptom logs to appointments\n- Consider requesting an EEG and MRI\n- Continue documenting episodes\n\nThese symptoms shouldn't be dismissed. TLE can be subtle but is a real medical condition that often requires treatment. Your proactive approach with logging symptoms is great - keep advocating for yourself with medical professionals."

    "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your symptoms, it's understandable why doctors are having difficulty pinpointing an exact diagnosis. Here are some observations and suggestions:\n\n1. Possible Autoimmune Connection:\n- The combination of joint pain, mouth sores, hair loss, and low-grade fevers does suggest a possible autoimmune condition\n- Lupus is a reasonable consideration, which is why your rheumatologist ordered those specific tests\n- The ANA test will be particularly important\n\n2. Movement Episodes:\n- The disagreement among doctors about whether these are seizures is notable\n- Consider getting a referral to a neurologist if you haven't already\n- Video recording an episode could be helpful for doctors to better evaluate\n\n3. Medication Considerations:\n- The combination of Wellbutrin and Cymbalta could potentially contribute to some symptoms\n- Wellbutrin can lower seizure threshold in some people\n- Consider discussing this with your psychiatrist\n\n4. Additional Suggestions:\n- Keep a detailed symptom diary including:\n  * When symptoms occur\n  * What makes them better/worse\n  * Any potential triggers\n  * Correlation with menstrual cycle\n- Consider getting evaluated for:\n  * Other autoimmune conditions\n  * Sleep disorders\n  * Vitamin deficiencies (especially B12, D, and Iron)\n\n5. Important Next Steps:\n- Complete the ordered autoimmune panels\n- Consider stopping cannabis use as it appears to worsen symptoms\n- Get a neurological consultation if not already done\n- Document episodes (video if possible)\n\nRemember to keep all your doctors informed about what other specialists are saying and testing for."

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is certainly an unusual and complex case, given your age, gender, and overall healthy lifestyle. Here are some thoughts and considerations:\n\n1. Potential connections to explore:\n- The temporal relationship between epilepsy onset and bone issues suggests they might be related\n- Lexapro (SSRIs) has been associated with increased fracture risk in some studies\n- The combination of new-onset epilepsy and bone issues could suggest an underlying metabolic or genetic condition\n\n2. Tests to consider if not already done:\n- Vitamin D, calcium, and PTH levels\n- Celiac disease screening\n- Testosterone levels\n- Genetic testing for rare bone disorders\n- Complete thyroid panel\n- Markers of bone turnover\n- 24-hour urinary calcium\n- Screening for mastocytosis\n\n3. Other considerations:\n- Have you had a bone biopsy?\n- Has anyone investigated potential rare genetic syndromes?\n- Have your doctors considered the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome?\n\n4. Recommendations:\n- Consider getting evaluated at a major academic medical center\n- Ask about consulting with a metabolic bone specialist\n- Consider getting a second opinion from another endocrinologist\n- Keep detailed records of all symptoms and their timing\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?"

    "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your concern is completely understandable. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. First seizures often lead to medical investigations, but not all people who have one seizure will have another. However, the \"absent moments\" you've noticed might suggest a pattern of seizure activity.\n\n2. The 30-minute distance to a hospital is longer than ideal but not necessarily prohibitive. Many people with epilepsy live in areas with similar hospital distances.\n\n3. Important considerations for your decision:\n- Do you have travel insurance that covers pre-existing conditions?\n- Will you have access to emergency services in France?\n- Can you communicate effectively with French medical providers if needed?\n- Does your son have any triggers identified (lack of sleep, stress, etc.)?\n\n4. If you decide to go:\n- Ensure you have travel insurance\n- Get a letter from your GP explaining the situation\n- Learn basic seizure first aid\n- Keep a detailed record of any episodes\n- Maintain regular sleep schedule\n- Avoid potential triggers\n\nWhile it would be ideal to have a diagnosis and treatment plan before traveling, this isn't always possible. Consider discussing with your GP for their medical opinion given the specific circumstances.\n\nIf the anxiety would significantly impact your ability to enjoy the trip, postponing might be worth considering for peace of mind."

(I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Persistent microscopic hematuria (blood in urine) can have several causes, and your doctor will likely want to investigate further. Common next steps may include:\n\n1. Imaging studies:\n- CT scan or ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract\n- Looking for stones, tumors, or structural abnormalities\n\n2. Additional urine tests:\n- 24-hour urine collection\n- Urine cytology to check for abnormal cells\n\n3. Possible referral to specialists:\n- Urologist\n- Nephrologist (kidney specialist)\n\nSome other potential causes of hematuria include:\n- Exercise-induced hematuria\n- Medication side effects\n- Glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation)\n- Bladder conditions\n- Hereditary conditions\n\nGiven your age and medical history, it's likely benign, but it's important to identify the cause.

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse.

Autonomic dysfunction\n\nThe dismissive response from the attending neurologist is concerning, especially given:\n- The clear pattern and progression of symptoms\n- The objective neurological findings (weakness during testing)\n- The involvement of multiple neurological systems\n- The history of enlarged lymph node\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Document episodes (video when possible)\n2. Keep a detailed symptom diary\n3. Seek a second neurological opinion\n4. Consider requesting:\n   - MRI brain/spine with contrast\n   - Extended EEG monitoring\n   - Autonomic testing\n   - Comprehensive blood work\n\nHave you had any similar episodes before or other neurological symptoms?"

    "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Those head-shaking movements could be several things, and it's important to discuss these new symptoms with your neurologist. Some possibilities include:\n\n1. Tics\n- Sudden, repetitive movements\n- Common in children\n- Can include head shaking, eye blinking, facial grimacing\n- Often worse with stress or excitement\n\n2. Focal seizures\n- Can present differently than typical seizures\n- May not show on a standard EEG\n- Can include head movements and facial expressions\n\n3. Dystonia\n- Involuntary muscle contractions\n- Can cause repetitive movements or twisted postures\n\n4. Myoclonus\n- Brief, shock-like muscle jerks\n\nSince your son has a history of tremors and one previous seizure, it's best to:\n1. Document when these episodes occur\n2. Try to video record them\n3. Note any triggers or patterns\n4. Share this information with your neurologist\n\nThe neurologist might recommend:\n- Additional testing\n- Longer EEG monitoring\n- Other diagnostic procedures\n\nThis isn't something you should try to diagnose on your own - professional medical evaluation is important."

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the EEG description provided, here are the key findings:\n\n1. The background activity is:\n- Moderately pronounced\n- Around 10 cycles per second (normal alpha rhythm)\n- Shows some instability in amplitude\n- Has incomplete reactivity to eye opening/closing\n\n2. Notable abnormalities include:\n- Dysrhythmias (irregular brain wave patterns) in the left temporal and frontotemporal regions\n- Sharp wave complexes in these areas\n- The abnormalities are more prominent in the T3-F7 and F3-FP1 regions\n\n3. Response to testing:\n- No activation with flickering light\n- Mild activation of the abnormal patterns during hyperventilation\n\nThese findings, particularly the sharp waves and focal dysrhythmias, could be consistent with epileptiform activity, which explains why your doctor referred you to an epilepsy specialist.\n\nYour symptoms (disorientation, fatigue, concentration issues, and \"weird\" feelings) could potentially be consistent with focal seizures, but only a specialist can make this determination.\n\nPlease note: This is not a diagnosis, and you should wait to discuss these findings with the epilepsy specialist who can properly interpret them in the context of your clinical history and symptoms."

    "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're concerned about potential drug interactions, particularly regarding seizure risk, in your current medication regimen. While I can't provide medical advice, I can help organize the key points to discuss with your healthcare provider:\n\nKey Medications:\n- Trazodone 100mg (sleep)\n- Klonopin PRN (anxiety/sleep)\n- Adderall 30mg (ADHD)\n- Wellbutrin 150mg (depression)\n\nMain Concerns:\n1. Seizure threshold lowering from multiple interactions\n2. Orthostatic hypotension symptoms\n3. Overall safety of medication combination\n\nPositive Factors:\n- No personal or family history of seizures\n- Regular monitoring by psychiatrist\n- Stable on current regimen for extended period\n- Good therapeutic response\n\nSuggestions for Next Steps:\n1. Document any symptoms or side effects\n2. Discuss specific seizure risk concerns with your psychiatrist\n3. Consider requesting formal medication review\n4. Ask about regular monitoring parameters\n\nGiven your medical background and upcoming medical training, you might want to request specific research or guidelines your psychiatrist uses to support the safety of this combination."

    "answer": "While I understand your question, I cannot provide definitive medical advice about whether it's safe for you to play specific games. This is a decision that should be made in consultation with your neurologist because they:\n\n1. Know your complete medical history\n2. Understand your specific type of seizures\n3. Can evaluate your individual risk factors\n4. Are familiar with your response to medication\n\nHowever, I can share some general information:\n- Not all people with epilepsy are photosensitive\n- Being well-controlled on medication can reduce risk\n- Individual triggers can vary significantly between people\n- Past tolerance to similar stimuli doesn't guarantee future safety\n\nThe safest approach would be to:\n1. Consult your neurologist about this specific concern\n2. If you do try the game, have someone present the first time\n3. Play in a well-lit room\n4. Take frequent breaks\n5.

    "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",

    "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your detailed description, these episodes warrant medical evaluation, particularly by a neurologist. Here's why:\n\n1. Your symptoms suggest possible focal seizures (formerly called partial seizures), which can present with:\n- Maintained consciousness\n- Unusual sensations\n- Emotional changes\n- Altered awareness\n- Memory flashbacks\n- Speech difficulties\n\n2. Risk factors/concerning elements:\n- Multiple medications that can lower seizure threshold (bupropion especially)\n- Marijuana use\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Decreased exercise tolerance\n- Recent onset of symptoms\n\nYou're not \"making this up.\" These are real symptoms that need investigation. Steps to consider:\n\n1. See your primary care physician for referral to a neurologist\n2. Keep a detailed symptom diary\n3. Have someone video record episodes if possible\n4. Consider EEG and brain imaging\n5. Discuss your current medications with your doctors\n\nUntil evaluated:\n- Avoid driving during periods when symptoms might occur\n- Ensure medication compliance\n- Consider reducing/stopping marijuana use\n- Get adequate sleep\n\nThese episodes could be seizures, migraines, or other neurological events, but proper diagnosis requires professional evaluation."

    "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps.

    "answer": "What you're describing sounds like it could be several phenomena, possibly occurring together:\n\n1. Sleep Paralysis or Hypnopompic State: This occurs during the transition between sleep and wakefulness, where you might experience unusual sensations and altered consciousness.\n\n2. Panic Attack: The symptoms you described - difficulty thinking clearly, feeling of unreality, intense fear response, and emotional flooding - are common during panic attacks.\n\n3. Dissociation: The feeling of thoughts not being yours and the disconnection from emotions are classic signs of dissociation, which can be triggered by stress or anxiety.\n\n4. Sleep Inertia: This is the groggy feeling after waking up, but in some cases, it can be more severe and include confusion and impaired cognitive function.\n\nThe combination of waking up at an unusual hour (4 AM, when your body is typically in deep sleep) and possible anxiety could have triggered this experience. The feeling of not being able to think clearly and the \"burning paper\" sensation you described could be related to your brain still being partially in sleep mode while trying to process conscious thoughts.\n\nIf this happens regularly or you're concerned, it would be worth:\n1. Consulting a sleep specialist\n2. Discussing this with a mental health professional\n3. Maintaining good sleep hygiene\n4.

    "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Since your anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have been changed from Tegretol (which is processed by the liver) to Keppra and Topamax (which are processed by the kidneys), your blood testing requirements will likely change. Here's what you might expect:\n\n1. Renal Function Tests:\n- These will likely be added to monitor kidney function\n- Include tests like creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and GFR\n\n2. Previous Tests:\n- LFTs might still be monitored but less frequently\n- CBC/FBC will likely continue as it's important for general health monitoring\n- Drug levels may be checked periodically for Keppra and Topamax\n\n3. Typical Monitoring Pattern:\n- More frequent testing initially after medication change\n- If stable, testing may become less frequent\n- Usually includes both kidney and liver function to ensure overall health\n\nIt's best to discuss the specific testing schedule with your healthcare provider as it can vary based on individual factors and response to medication."

Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "While 23andMe does test for some genetic variants associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC1 and TSC2 genes), it's important to note that:\n\n1. 23andMe is not a diagnostic test and shouldn't be used as a substitute for clinical genetic testing\n\n2. The test doesn't capture all possible mutations that could cause TS\n\n3. Consumer genetic tests may miss rare or complex variants\n\nFor accurate diagnosis of TS, you would need:\n- Clinical genetic testing ordered by a doctor\n- Full sequencing of TSC1 and TSC2 genes\n- Medical evaluation including brain MRI, skin examination, and other specific tests\n\nGiven the urgency of your situation with infantile spasms, focusing on getting the EEG and proper medical evaluation should be the priority. If TS is suspected, your medical team can order appropriate genetic testing specifically designed to detect TS-causing mutations.\n\nPlease continue working with medical professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment rather than relying on consumer genetic testing in this situation."

    "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your symptoms, Catamenial Epilepsy could be a possibility, as it is a form of seizure activity that occurs in relation to the menstrual cycle. Here are some key points to consider:\n\nCommon symptoms that align with your description:\n- Changes in consciousness/confusion\n- Unusual sensations (tingling, waves)\n- Breathing irregularities\n- Muscle tension\n- Memory gaps\n- Involuntary vocalizations\n\nImportant factors:\n1. The correlation with your menstrual cycle is significant\n2. The response to Ativan (an anti-anxiety medication that also has anticonvulsant properties) is noteworthy\n3. The presence of automatisms (unconscious behaviors like groaning/mumbling)\n\nRecommendations:\n1. See a neurologist for proper evaluation\n2. Keep a detailed symptom diary\n3. Consider video recording episodes if possible\n4. Discuss hormone-related treatment options with your doctor\n\nThis requires professional medical evaluation for proper diagnosis and treatment. While catamenial epilepsy is possible, other conditions should also be considered:\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Severe dysmenorrhea complications\n- Panic attacks\n- Non-epileptic seizures\n\nThe severity of your symptoms warrants thorough investigation by a specialist."

I could feel a very tender lump right where the occipital lymph node is (thanks google!) I did palpate it a lot, and it is extremely painful today. I was also up all night with an awful migraine (first one in months since I started Aimovig) and it spread to my entire head and it was 8/10 pain. I do not have a fever. My headache is better when upright and has gotten a bit better throughout the day but the very painful bulge is still there. It also hurts at rest in that area. I felt lethargic and drained this morning.Took a covid test. Negative. Worried I have an infection or something but no fever? I have a big, painful and possible infected spit of cystic acne on my right cheek. Not sure if related.I\u2019ve also been having bad muscular pain on the right side of my shoulder after packing and lifting boxes, it kept me up thursday night. But it got better-ish. Not sure if it\u2019s related. Kinda feels worse today.Should I be concerned? It hurts to turn my head/move my head at alland I know that if I lie down my headache would return. If i even brush the lymph node it hurts so much. Was hard to brush my hair.Any insight appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: swollen potential lymph node in the occipital area at the base of skull. very painful. have a headache. concerned about infection but no fever.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your symptoms, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. The swollen and painful occipital lymph node could be related to:\n- The infected acne on your cheek (lymph nodes can swell when fighting infection)\n- Recent muscle strain from moving boxes\n- Your migraine\n- Stress on the area from excessive palpation\n\n2. The absence of fever doesn't rule out infection, but it's a positive sign that the condition might not be severe.\n\n3. The combination of symptoms suggests you should seek medical attention, especially because:\n- You have epilepsy and are on multiple medications\n- The pain is severe and affecting daily activities\n- The recent change in your migraine pattern (first one in months)\n- The lymph node is extremely tender\n- You're experiencing multiple symptoms on the same side\n\nIt would be advisable to:\n1. Contact your healthcare provider\n2. Document your symptoms and their progression\n3. Avoid excessive touching of the lymph node\n4. Monitor for fever or worsening symptoms\n5. Consider if any of your new medications (like Aptiom) might be contributing\n\nWhile waiting to see a doctor, you can:\n- Apply a warm compress to the area\n- Take OTC pain relievers (if approved with your current medications)\n- Maintain good posture\n- Rest and stay hydrated"

    "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is indeed a complex and concerning presentation. Several possibilities come to mind:\n\n1. Postictal Psychosis\n- Can occur after clusters of seizures\n- Characterized by confusion, altered behavior, and psychiatric symptoms\n- Usually temporary but requires medical attention\n\n2. Non-Epileptic Psychogenic Seizures\n- Can co-exist with epilepsy\n- Often seen in patients with psychiatric conditions\n- Can present with atypical symptoms and behaviors\n\n3. Medication-Related Issues\n- Interactions between antidepressants, sleep medications, and antiepileptics\n- Possible toxicity or adverse effects\n- Changes in medication levels\n\n4. Underlying Psychiatric Manifestations\n- History of depression and suspected eating disorder could be relevant\n- Stress and anxiety can trigger both seizures and psychiatric symptoms\n\nPriority investigations should include:\n- Comprehensive toxicology screening\n- EEG monitoring\n- Review of all current medications\n- Psychiatric evaluation\n\nGiven the unusual presentation and multiple seizures, continued hospital monitoring is appropriate. The neurologist will likely want to review the case thoroughly."

    "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can\u2019t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can\u2019t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it\u2019s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can\u2019t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",

    "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

    "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Let me help break down these medical terms for you:\n\n1. Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone:\n- This means there's an enlargement of part of the brain's ventricles (fluid-filled spaces) due to surrounding tissue loss\n- \"Ex-vacuo\" literally means \"from emptiness\" - the space enlarges to fill where tissue has been lost\n\n2. T-weighted high-signal gliosis:\n- Gliosis is scarring in the brain tissue\n- \"T-weighted\" refers to the type of MRI imaging used\n- \"High-signal\" means it appears bright on the MRI\n- Together, this indicates scarring that's visible on the MRI\n\n3. Hippocampal abnormalities:\n- Could include changes in size, shape, or internal structure\n- In your case, likely related to the mesial temporal sclerosis (scarring)\n\n4. Associated regional atrophy:\n- Atrophy means tissue shrinkage/loss\n- \"Regional\" means it's localized to specific areas\n- \"Associated\" suggests it's connected to the primary condition\n\n5. Periventricular white matter:\n- This is a normal brain structure\n- \"Periventricular\" means around the ventricles\n- \"White matter\" contains nerve fibers that connect different parts of the brain\n- In your case, this area shows signs of damage (gliosis)\n\nThis pattern of changes is typical for temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly with mesial temporal sclerosis."

    "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal.

    "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the complex history you've described, your theory about potential co-existing PNES and epilepsy makes clinical sense. Here's why:\n\n1. The response to Keppra (elimination of hallucinations) suggests there might be an underlying neurological component, as Keppra is specifically an anti-epileptic medication.\n\n2. The negative EEG findings during episodes confirm PNES, but it's important to note that:\n   - A 3-day EEG might miss epileptic events\n   - It's possible to have both conditions simultaneously\n\n3. The return of hallucinations after Keppra discontinuation suggests:\n   - Either the medication was treating an underlying epileptic component\n   - Or the medication had an independent beneficial effect on the hallucinations\n\nI would recommend:\n1. Documenting all symptoms carefully\n2. Requesting urgent follow-up with the neurologist given the return of symptoms\n3. Possibly considering a longer EEG monitoring period\n4. Getting a second opinion if possible\n\nYour theory is reasonable and warrants further investigation. The quick return of hallucinations after Keppra discontinuation is particularly noteworthy and should be discussed with her healthcare providers.\n\nRemember, I'm offering general information and not medical advice. The situation requires professional medical evaluation."

Convulsive Syncope: When fainting is accompanied by brief jerking movements, which can look similar to a seizure but isn't one.\n\nThis reaction to needles is also known as:\n- Needle phobia\n- Trypanophobia\n- Blood-injection-injury phobia\n\nThe involuntary movements you experienced might be:\n- Myoclonic jerks\n- Convulsive movements associated with syncope\n\nTo manage this in the future, you might want to:\n1. Inform medical staff about your history\n2. Try lying down during blood draws\n3. Use applied tension technique (tensing muscles)\n4. Consider consulting with your doctor about anti-anxiety medications\n\nRemember to always inform healthcare providers about this reaction before procedures involving needles."

    "question": "49YO female with IBS like symptoms due to adhesions choking intestines, non-epileptic seizures due to migraines, deaf, in TCHP chemo for breast cancer, BMX August 1, 2018, no node involvement. 5'6, 220lbs. Effexor for seizure prevention. Bupropion for situational depression related to health challenges. I lost my hair to chemo, so for the first time I noticed I have ridges in my scalp. Googling that, only one thing comes up: Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG). My ridges, however, are very mild compared to most images. I can see them in the mirror, but can't find a way to accurately photograph them. They are very much like this in location and \"layout\", but not quite as deep. This is listed as something different though, related to mental retardation (article's words) from birth. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00105-007-1302-4 I do have a couple of the secondary issues listed, namely non-epileptic seizures and deafness. The former is blamed on migraines that left lesions on the brain and the latter is blamed on the seizures. Should I see an endocrinologist, or is this something else?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the observation of scalp ridges, it would be prudent to have this evaluated by a healthcare professional. While CVG can be primary (present from birth and often associated with developmental issues) or secondary (developing later in life due to various conditions), there are several considerations in your case:\n\n1. Secondary CVG can be associated with:\n- Endocrine disorders\n- Inflammatory conditions\n- Certain medications\n- Neoplastic conditions\n\n2. Your current situation includes:\n- Ongoing cancer treatment\n- Multiple medications\n- Neurological symptoms\n- Recent hair loss allowing observation of the condition\n\nThe best approach would be to:\n1. First consult with your oncologist, as they're managing your current treatment\n2. They can then refer you to the appropriate specialist, which might be:\n- A dermatologist (for direct scalp evaluation)\n- An endocrinologist (if hormonal causes are suspected)\n- A neurologist (given your existing neurological symptoms)\n\nDon't self-diagnose based on internet images, as many conditions can cause similar appearances. Professional evaluation is important for proper diagnosis and treatment if needed."

    "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your concern is understandable. Here are some possible reasons why the neurologist might want to increase the dosage even though the current dose seems to be working:\n\n1. Prevention of breakthrough seizures: Even if seizures are controlled now, the doctor may want to ensure better long-term control and prevent any breakthrough seizures.\n\n2. Weight-based dosing: The optimal dose is often calculated based on body weight, and the doctor might be adjusting to reach the recommended therapeutic level.\n\n3. Initial response vs. long-term control: Sometimes the initial response to medication can be positive but may not provide sustained control at lower doses.\n\n4. Minor episodes: Since your son is still having some minor episodes (dizziness), the doctor may want to eliminate these completely.\n\nHowever, it's absolutely appropriate to:\n- Ask your neurologist to explain their reasoning for increasing the dose\n- Discuss your concerns about potential side effects\n- Ask about the pros and cons of staying at the current dose versus increasing it\n- Request monitoring of drug levels if applicable\n\nRemember, you can always seek a second opinion if you remain uncertain about the treatment plan.\n\nWould you feel comfortable asking your neurologist these questions at your next appointment?"

    "question": "48F, 152cm, 70kgGraves' disease in and out of remission for 10 years (remission last 2 years)Stopped carbimazole two weeks agoVery mild temporal lobe epilepsy for 30 yearsLevetiracetam 500mg dailyTetanus vaccination for deep cat scratch five days agoJust finishing a 5-day course of amoxicillin w/ clavulanic acid for same scratchA few days ago, I noticed some swelling above my left clavicle, and I can feel a pea-to-marble sized lump. Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, there are several reasonable explanations for your swollen lymph node, with the recent tetanus vaccination being a very likely cause:\n\n1. Recent Vaccination: Swollen lymph nodes are a common and normal response to vaccinations, particularly in nodes near the injection site. This typically resolves within a few weeks.\n\n2. Recent Infection: The cat scratch and subsequent antibiotic treatment indicate a recent infection, which can also cause lymph node swelling.\n\n3. Timing: The fact that you noticed this shortly after these events (vaccination and infection) suggests they are likely related.\n\nSome reassuring points:\n- The size you describe (pea to marble) is within normal range for reactive lymph nodes\n- The temporal relationship with recent vaccination and infection provides a logical explanation\n- Lymph node swelling from vaccines typically resolves within 2-4 weeks\n\nWhile it's good that you're getting it checked by your doctor, the circumstances suggest this is likely a normal immune response rather than something more concerning. Continue monitoring the node, and notify your doctor if you notice significant changes before your appointment."

    "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures.

And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand your concern, but I need to be clear that you should always follow your doctor's advice when it comes to medication management. While waiting for your doctor's response, here are some general points to consider:\n\n1. Missing or delaying a dose by a few hours, while not ideal, is usually not catastrophic, especially if you're on multiple medications (Phenobarbital has a longer half-life than Vimpat)\n\n2. Phenobarbital stays in your system longer than Vimpat, which provides some protection\n\n3. Getting back on schedule with your next dose is important - don't double dose unless specifically instructed by your doctor\n\nSome precautions you might want to take:\n- Avoid sleep deprivation\n- Manage stress levels\n- Have someone with you while driving if possible\n- Ensure you take your next doses exactly on schedule\n\nIt's good that you've already contacted your doctor. If you feel any warning signs you usually experience before seizures, take appropriate precautions and seek medical help if needed.\n\nRemember: This is general information and not medical advice. Follow your doctor's instructions when they respond."

Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand this must be very concerning. An FSH level of 122.2 mIU/mL is indeed quite high and, combined with amenorrhea (absence of periods), strongly suggests premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature menopause.\n\nWhile spontaneous return of ovarian function can occur in some cases (about 5-10% of women with POI), it's less likely with very high FSH levels like yours.\n\nPossible causes include:\n1. Autoimmune disorders\n2. Genetic factors (like Turner syndrome or FMR1 premutations)\n3. Metabolic disorders\n4. Previous chemotherapy/radiation\n5. Surgery\n6. In many cases, the cause remains unknown (idiopathic)\n\nImportant considerations:\n1. Bone health: Early loss of estrogen increases osteoporosis risk\n2. Cardiovascular health\n3. Psychological impact\n4. Fertility implications\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Follow up with your doctor for:\n   - Complete hormone panel\n   - Genetic testing\n   - Autoimmune screening\n   - Bone density scan\n2. Consider consultation with:\n   - Endocrinologist\n   - Reproductive specialist\n   - Mental health professional\n\nEarly intervention with hormone replacement therapy (if appropriate) can help manage symptoms and protect long-term health.\n\nHave you noticed any other symptoms besides missed periods?"

    "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here.

    "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?

    "answer": "I understand your concern about these MRI findings. Let me help break this down:\n\n1. Post-surgical changes:\n- Some degree of encephalomalacia (brain tissue softening) and gliosis (scarring) is actually NORMAL after brain surgery\n- These changes are typically expected as part of the healing process\n\n2. The good news from the MRI:\n- The amygdala and hippocampi appear normal\n- No new masses or obvious epileptogenic foci were found\n- The changes appear localized to the surgical area\n\n3. Regarding treatment possibilities:\n- The return of seizures after being seizure-free might be related to:\n  * Medication withdrawal\n  * Natural disease progression\n  * Post-surgical changes\n- The first approach is usually medication adjustment rather than immediate consideration of surgery\n\n4. Next steps typically include:\n- Restarting or adjusting anti-seizure medications\n- Regular monitoring\n- EEG to assess current brain activity patterns\n\nWhile waiting for your appointment, know that having one breakthrough seizure doesn't necessarily mean treatment has failed. Many patients achieve good control with medication adjustments.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these points in more detail?"

    "question": " 50F in Australia, on carbimazole and levetiracetam for Graves\u2019 and epilepsy, respectively. FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your symptoms - pain near the thumb base, difficulty gripping, shooting pain with thumb movement, and sleep disruption - it would be prudent to get this evaluated sooner rather than later. While it might not be an emergency, there are several reasons to consider getting it checked this weekend:\n\n1. Scaphoid fractures (a common wrist bone injury from FOOSH) can be difficult to detect early and may worsen if untreated\n2. Your medications might affect bone health\n3. Early treatment generally leads to better outcomes with wrist injuries\n4. Proper immobilization (if needed) shouldn't be delayed\n\nIf ED wait times are long, you could try:\n- Using a wrist splint\n- Applying ice\n- Keeping the wrist elevated\n- Taking appropriate pain relief\n\nHowever, if pain worsens or you develop numbness/tingling, seek immediate care. Would you like more specific information about any of these points?"

    "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

    "answer": "Based on your detailed history, here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. Medication Expiration:\n- While medications don't immediately become ineffective after expiration, their potency can gradually decrease\n- Your history suggests sensitivity to even slight variations in medication effectiveness\n- The pattern you observed with blood levels increasing after switching to newer bottles is noteworthy\n\n2. Contributing Factors to Seizures:\n- Sleep deprivation\n- Stress\n- Potentially reduced medication effectiveness\n\n3. Regarding Your Questions:\n\nAbout the current medication expiring in August 2022:\n- Given your history of sensitivity and previous experiences, it might be prudent to switch to the newer bottles (expiring June 2023)\n- The return of morning headaches could be an early warning sign\n\nRegarding XR 600mg (3x200mg) vs 2x300mg:\n- Different release patterns could theoretically affect blood levels\n- Best to consult your neurologist about this specific change\n- If changing, monitor closely for any changes in effectiveness\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Switch to the newer medication\n2. Maintain consistent sleep patterns\n3. Document any changes in symptoms\n4. Work with your neurologist on stress management strategies\n5. Consider regular blood level monitoring\n\nAlways consult with your neurologist before making any medication changes."

    "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "You have good reason to be skeptical. While newborn seizures can occur and aren't necessarily indicative of serious problems, the explanation given by the neurologist seems scientifically questionable. Here's why:\n\n1. The timing doesn't make sense - seizures occurring 3 days after birth are unlikely to be related to the mother's state during delivery\n\n2. Multiple seizures within 24 hours is concerning and typically warrants thorough investigation\n\n3. Neonatal seizures can have various causes including:\n- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (lack of oxygen during birth)\n- Metabolic problems\n- Infections\n- Structural brain abnormalities\n- Electrolyte imbalances\n\nWhile it's positive that initial tests are normal, this situation likely warrants:\n- Continued monitoring\n- Complete metabolic workup\n- Possible EEG monitoring\n- Further investigation if seizures continue\n\nIt would be reasonable for the family to:\n1. Seek a second opinion\n2. Keep detailed records of any episodes\n3. Request copies of all test results\n4. Ask for clear explanation of the diagnosis and treatment plan\n\nThe family should trust their instincts if they're concerned and shouldn't hesitate to advocate for more thorough evaluation if seizures continue."

Panic attacks\n\nRegarding epilepsy:\n- While temporal lobe epilepsy can sometimes cause DPDR-like symptoms, it usually presents with other symptoms\n- A normal MRI is reassuring, though it doesn't completely rule out epilepsy\n- If you're concerned about seizures, an EEG would be more helpful in diagnosing epilepsy\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Consult a psychiatrist/psychologist to evaluate for anxiety/depression\n2. Maintain good sleep habits\n3. Reduce stress through relaxation techniques\n4. Consider discussing with your neurologist about getting an EEG if concerns persist\n5.

    "question": "25F white JME keppra 1gMy epilepsy seems very well controlled with keppra. No complaints.Lately I've been feeling really tired, but I'm getting good sleep. I don't have any signs of seizures when I wake up. It's always been hard to wake up in the mornings, but lately it's been awful. It feels like I didn't sleep at all.I was working today. I closed my eyes to blink, and everything was kinda dizzy, but it went away quick. It's hard to describe, it's kinda like dizziness, but also like everything's... dropping? Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",

    "answer": "Based on your description, here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. Keppra (Levetiracetam) effectiveness:\n- While rare, tolerance to antiepileptic medications can develop\n- Drug effectiveness can sometimes change over time\n- Blood levels should be monitored periodically\n\n2. Your symptoms could be:\n- Breakthrough seizure activity\n- Side effects from medication\n- Sleep-related issues\n- A combination of these factors\n\n3. Red flags that need attention:\n- New types of symptoms\n- Increased fatigue\n- Dizziness/visual disturbances\n- Changes in consciousness\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Contact your neurologist to:\n- Discuss these new symptoms\n- Check your Keppra levels\n- Evaluate if dose adjustment is needed\n\n2. Meanwhile:\n- Keep a symptom diary\n- Maintain regular sleep schedule\n- Don't skip doses\n- Avoid triggers (lack of sleep, alcohol, stress)\n\nPlease don't ignore these symptoms - while they might be minor, it's better to have them evaluated by your healthcare provider to ensure your epilepsy remains well-controlled."

    "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds.

    "answer": "This sounds like a complex medical situation that requires careful evaluation. Here are some thoughts and questions:\n\n1. Given the correlation with her menstrual cycle, has she been evaluated by a gynecologist?

    "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Your seizures were caused by postpartum eclampsia (a temporary condition) and not epilepsy\n2. Your blood pressure is now stabilized and you're off blood pressure medications\n3. You've only been on Keppra for about a month\n4. You have valid concerns about caring for your newborn\n\nGenerally, the risk of seizures should be low since:\n- The underlying cause (eclampsia) has been treated\n- You have no prior history of seizures\n- The Keppra was prescribed as a precautionary measure\n\nHowever, it's still important to:\n1. Get clear instructions from your doctor about tapering off\n2. Have someone with you when first reducing/stopping the medication if possible\n3. Monitor for any concerning symptoms\n\nSince you're not getting adequate responses from the neurologist, consider:\n- Consulting your OB/GYN who treated your eclampsia\n- Getting a second neurologist opinion\n- Having your primary care physician involved\n\nFor peace of mind, you might want to arrange for someone to be with you during the first few days of medication changes."

    "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your detailed description, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Regarding the initial episode:\n- The presentation (electric shock sensation, convulsions, loss of consciousness) is more consistent with a seizure than a typical TIA\n- However, vascular events can trigger seizures as a secondary effect\n\n2. About the vascular findings:\n- Carotid dissection can indeed cause both TIAs and seizures\n- The 8mm lesion could be related to the vascular issue and might have become an epileptogenic focus\n\n3. Concerning your nightly symptoms:\n- These could be:\n  * Auras (pre-seizure warnings)\n  * Anxiety related to the initial event\n  * Small vascular events\n\n4. Regarding medication:\n- Duration of anticonvulsant therapy would depend on:\n  * Whether seizures continue\n  * The underlying cause and its treatment\n  * Risk factors for recurrence\n\nGiven your complex case, you should discuss with your doctors:\n1. Results of the cerebral angiogram\n2. Whether the lesion could be causing focal seizures\n3. The possibility of trying different anticonvulsants with fewer side effects\n\nIt's too early to definitively say if this is lifelong epilepsy, as treating the vascular issue might resolve the seizures.\n\nDisclaimer: This is general information and not medical advice.

I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5\u20199 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I\u2019m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don\u2019t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress. They booked me in with a neurologist but it might take 3 week. What\u2019s wrong with me ?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your description, several factors could be contributing to these symptoms:\n\n1. Stress and Anxiety\n- Stress can cause muscle twitching (fasciculations)\n- Anxiety can heighten awareness of normal body sensations\n- Both can cause sleep disturbances and muscle tension\n\n2. Medication-Related\n- Epilim (Sodium Valproate) can have side effects including tremors\n- Changes in medication levels could affect symptoms\n\n3. Fatigue and Sleep Issues\n- Lack of proper sleep can cause muscle twitches\n- Fatigue can increase neurological symptoms\n\n4. Possible Physical Factors\n- Electrolyte imbalances\n- Vitamin deficiencies (particularly B12, magnesium)\n- Dehydration\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Continue taking your medication as prescribed\n2. Keep your upcoming neurology appointment\n3. Try stress-reduction techniques (meditation, deep breathing)\n4. Maintain good sleep hygiene\n5. Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet\n\nThe doctors' assessment of stress-related fasciculations seems reasonable, but it's good that you're getting checked by a neurologist to rule out other causes. If symptoms worsen significantly before your appointment, contact your healthcare provider."

    "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This sounds like it could have been a focal seizure that progressed to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, possibly caused by various underlying conditions. The initial symptoms you described (freezing, facial asymmetry, unnatural laughter) are consistent with what's known as a focal onset seizure, which can sometimes involve:\n\n1. Gelastic seizures (seizures characterized by sudden, inappropriate laughter)\n2. Focal aware seizures (where consciousness is initially maintained)\n\nThe progression to falling, unconsciousness, and convulsions suggests the seizure became generalized (spread to both sides of the brain).\n\nThe blood from the ear could indeed be from trauma from the fall, as the doctors suggested.\n\nGiven his age and that this was apparently his first seizure, possible underlying causes could include:\n- Stroke\n- Brain tumor\n- Head injury\n- Cerebrovascular disease\n\nIt's crucial that he receives a full neurological workup to determine the underlying cause, as new-onset seizures in older adults often have a serious underlying cause that requires treatment.\n\nThis is all speculative - only his doctors can make a proper diagnosis after appropriate testing and examination."

    "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This practice is actually quite common and standard for many neurological medications, including anticonvulsants like Lamotrigine, for several reasons:\n\n1. Monitoring: Regular check-ups are necessary to:\n- Monitor drug effectiveness\n- Check for side effects\n- Adjust dosage if needed\n- Conduct necessary blood tests\n- Evaluate overall seizure control\n\n2. Legal/Medical Guidelines: Many physicians are required to see patients regularly to continue prescribing certain medications, even if they're not controlled substances.\n\n3. Standard of Care: Regular follow-up is considered best practice for epilepsy management.\n\nHowever, most neurologists will:\n- Remind patients when follow-up appointments are needed\n- Have emergency protocols for patients who are running low on medication\n- Provide a short-term bridge prescription if needed\n\nWhile it may seem strict, this approach helps ensure proper medical care. That said, you could:\n- Ask about their policy for emergency situations\n- Set up appointment reminders\n- Schedule follow-ups well in advance\n- Discuss concerns about appointment availability with your doctor\n\nYour frustration is understandable, but this practice is generally meant to protect patient safety rather than being unnecessarily difficult."

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand your concerns about your cognitive symptoms and diagnosis. Here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. Medication Response Time:\n- Carbamazepine (Zeptol) can take several weeks to reach its full effectiveness\n- The dose may need adjustment to find the optimal level for you\n- It's important to be patient during this initial treatment period\n\n2. Memory Issues:\n- Memory problems can be a symptom of epilepsy itself\n- Some memory issues might be temporary and improve with proper treatment\n- Anti-epileptic medications can sometimes affect cognition as a side effect\n\n3. Important Considerations:\n- Early-onset Alzheimer's is very rare\n- What you're experiencing may be related to:\n  * Epileptic activity\n  * Medication side effects\n  * Stress and anxiety\n  * Sleep issues\n  * Other underlying conditions\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Continue working closely with your neurologist\n2. Keep a detailed symptom diary\n3. Consider getting a second opinion from an epilepsy specialist\n4. Don't stop taking medication without medical supervision\n\nIt's important to:\n- Be patient with the treatment process\n- Communicate all concerns with your healthcare provider\n- Consider psychological support to help manage anxiety about your condition\n\nRemember: Many people with epilepsy lead normal, productive lives with proper treatment and management.\n\nPlease discuss your concerns about memory loss with your neurologist, as they can best evaluate your specific situation and adjust treatment if needed."

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, your symptoms appear to be more consistent with anxiety and possibly sleep-related issues rather than epilepsy or a brain tumor. Here's why:\n\n1. Deja vu is common in the general population and doesn't necessarily indicate a neurological problem\n2. The vibrations/buzzing sensation you describe sounds like hypnagogic hallucinations, which are normal experiences that can occur while falling asleep\n3. Your symptoms coincide with anxiety and health-related fears\n4. A neurologist has already examined you and found no neurological deficits\n5. The combination of anxiety and OCD can cause physical symptoms and heightened body awareness\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1. Practice good sleep hygiene\n2. Try relaxation techniques before bed\n3. Consider working with a mental health professional to address anxiety and health-related fears\n4. Continue regular check-ups with your primary care physician\n5. Keep a symptom diary to track patterns\n\nRemember, grand mal seizures typically occur without warning and don't have the gradual onset you're describing. If you're still concerned, discuss these fears with your regular doctor, who can determine if further testing is needed.\n\nThe fact that these symptoms have been present for a year without progression to serious neurological events is reassuring."

I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow.

I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started. I\u2019m really just making a post to gather more insight and experiences from doctors and other people as well. If anyone has any insight as to what could be causing this, it would be much appreciated. This diagnosis has kinda knocked me on my ass, as I can\u2019t drive for 6 months after my last seizure. While I\u2019m glad my scans/tests were unremarkable, I wish I had gotten some sort of answer.",

    "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here's my analysis:\n\n1. Relationship between Xifaxan (Rifaximin) and Seizures:\n- Yes, stopping Xifaxan could potentially be related to the seizures\n- Xifaxan is crucial in treating hepatic encephalopathy by reducing ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut\n- When stopped, ammonia levels can rise, potentially leading to neurological symptoms including seizures\n\n2. Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and Seizures:\n- Seizures can indeed be a symptom of HE\n- The cognitive symptoms you've noticed (decreased insight, short-term memory issues) are classic HE symptoms\n- Doing crosswords and playing piano doesn't rule out HE, as it can be subtle and progressive\n\n3. Concerning Factors:\n- Continued alcohol consumption\n- Recent discontinuation of Xifaxan\n- Increasing frequency of seizures\n- History of low sodium levels (which can also contribute to seizures)\n\n4. Recommendations:\n- Urgent discussion with his hepatologist about resuming Xifaxan\n- Consider alternative dosing schedules or formulations if side effects are problematic\n- Regular monitoring of ammonia levels and electrolytes\n- Continue with planned MRI to rule out other causes\n\nThe situation requires careful medical supervision, especially given the increasing frequency of seizures.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?"

(no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",

    "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

    "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",

A mild form of phlebitis (inflammation of the vein)\n3. Contact dermatitis from the materials used\n\nThese reactions are relatively common after IV placement and usually aren't serious. However, you should monitor the areas for:\n- Increasing redness or warmth\n- Severe swelling\n- Streaking redness extending from the site\n- Fever\n- Pus or discharge\n\nFor relief, you can try:\n1. Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (1%)\n2. Oral antihistamine like Benadryl\n3. Cool compresses\n4. Keeping the area clean and dry\n\nGiven your recent surgeries and medical history, if the rash:\n- Gets significantly worse\n- Spreads\n- Is accompanied by other symptoms\n- Doesn't improve in 2-3 days\n\nYou should contact your healthcare provider to be safe.\n\nAlso, make sure to mention this reaction to healthcare providers for future IV placements, as they may need to use different materials or take extra precautions."

However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute.

    "answer": "I understand you're concerned about these results and symptoms. Let me break this down:\n\nThe Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOS) being low (32nd percentile) while the hippocampal volume is normal (72nd percentile) typically indicates that while your hippocampi themselves are of normal size, there might be enlargement of the surrounding CSF spaces. This is supported by your higher ventricle percentiles.\n\nYour symptoms could be related to multiple factors:\n1. Post-COVID syndrome\n2. Previous CBD use\n3. Underlying epilepsy\n4. Depression\n5.

During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times.

    "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Brain zaps are actually a known phenomenon, particularly associated with medication changes, especially with medications that affect neurotransmitters. They're most commonly reported with:\n\n1. Starting or stopping antidepressants\n2. Missing doses of psychiatric medications\n3. Changes in dosage\n\nGiven that you mentioned inconsistent use of Strattera (atomoxetine), which works on norepinephrine levels in the brain, this could very well be the cause. Brain zaps are generally not dangerous, but they can be uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, your doctor is right to be cautious and order an MRI, especially given your history of:\n- Neurological disorders\n- Previous non-epileptic seizures\n- Tic disorder\n\nWhile brain zaps are likely medication-related, it's important to:\n1. Take your medication consistently\n2. Follow through with the MRI to rule out other causes\n3. Keep a log of when these episodes occur\n4. Note any other symptoms that accompany the zaps\n\nConsider discussing with your doctor:\n- Adjusting your medication schedule\n- Possibly changing the timing of doses\n- Whether a different medication might be more suitable\n\nIf symptoms worsen or you develop additional neurological symptoms, seek immediate medical attention."

    "question": "The other day I didn't use the dosage cup and just swallowed some Pepto-Bismol Max. I guess it was maybe a mouthful?

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "While taking more than the recommended dose of Pepto-Bismol isn't ideal, a single instance of overdose is unlikely to cause serious harm in most healthy adults. However, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. A typical \"mouthful\" is usually around 30mL, so even if you took a large swallow, you likely didn't exceed 60mL, which is still within the maximum daily dose of 120mL.\n\n2. The main concerns with Pepto-Bismol overdose are:\n- Salicylate toxicity (similar to aspirin overdose)\n- Bismuth toxicity\n\n3. Since you:\n- Only took one large dose\n- Haven't experienced new or worsening symptoms\n- Had this occur more than 24 hours ago\n\nThe risk of serious complications is relatively low.\n\nHowever, due to your epilepsy and medication use, it's always best to:\n1. Use the proper dosing cup in the future\n2. Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any unusual symptoms\n3. Keep track of any changes in your typical epilepsy symptoms\n\nIf you develop severe symptoms like:\n- Severe confusion\n- Significant hearing changes\n- Vomiting\n- Severe diarrhea\nSeek immediate medical attention.\n\nFor future reference, always use proper measuring tools and follow dosing instructions carefully."

    "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",

    "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given the specific pattern, sudden onset, and combination of symptoms you've described, it would be advisable to consult with a pediatrician or pediatric sleep specialist. Several aspects of these episodes warrant professional evaluation:\n\n1. The structured, predictable phases suggest these might be more complex than typical sleepwalking or night terrors\n2. Full recall of the episodes is unusual for parasomnia (sleep disorders)\n3. The visual distortions she describes (door frame appearing wrong, seeing a clone)\n4. The timing coinciding with both travel and a recent UTI/antibiotic course\n5. The repetitive nature and frequency (4 times in 4 weeks)\n6. The combination with her ADHD-C diagnosis\n\nWhile this could be anxiety-related, the specific pattern and her full awareness/recall suggest it might be worth investigating other possibilities, such as:\n- Focal seizures\n- Complex partial seizures\n- Medication side effects\n- Sleep-related movement disorder\n\nGiven her age and recent ADHD diagnosis, it would be beneficial to have these episodes evaluated by a medical professional who can determine if further testing (like an EEG) might be warranted.\n\nDocument the episodes (video if possible) and their timing to share with healthcare providers."

    "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "I understand you're going through a difficult time. Here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. Don't stop citalopram abruptly\n- This can cause withdrawal symptoms\n- Can worsen depression/anxiety\n- Need medical supervision to safely taper off\n\n2. SSRIs can occasionally:\n- Take 4-6 weeks to show full effect\n- Need dose adjustments\n- In some cases, make depression temporarily worse\n\n3. Regarding alternatives:\n- Amitriptyline with topiramate might need careful monitoring\n- Consider discussing these options with your GP:\n  * SNRIs (like venlafaxine)\n  * Bupropion (less sedating)\n  * Different SSRI combinations\n\n4. While waiting for GP:\n- Keep taking prescribed dose\n- Try emergency/walk-in services if feeling suicidal\n- Contact mental health crisis line\n- Consider private GP services\n\nPlease seek urgent medical attention if having suicidal thoughts.

We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",

    "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

    "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

The 15mm herniation you mentioned is significant and would be classified as a Type I Chiari malformation.\n\nGiven this situation, I would recommend:\n- Keeping detailed records of seizure activity\n- Discussing your concerns with both the neurologist and neurosurgeon\n- Asking specifically about any potential relationships between the conditions\n- Getting a second opinion if you remain concerned\n\nRemember that medical professionals base their conclusions on extensive research and clinical experience, but you should always feel comfortable asking questions about your son's care."

    "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your detailed description, here are some key observations and suggestions:\n\n1. The consistent 40-minute duration and the predictable pattern suggest this could be a specific type of neurological event.\n\n2. Given that the episodes occur more frequently during low-light months and were concurrent with Vitamin D deficiency, there might be a connection to:\n- Seasonal changes\n- Light sensitivity\n- Vitamin/mineral imbalances\n\n3. The history of concussions could be relevant, even if they seemed minor at the time.\n\nSome suggestions for further investigation:\n\n1. Consider seeing a neuro-ophthalmologist (specialists who deal with both neurological and eye conditions)\n\n2. Ask about testing for:\n- Myasthenia gravis\n- Multiple sclerosis\n- Vestibular disorders\n- Ocular motor nerve problems\n\n3. Keep a detailed diary of:\n- Weather conditions\n- Stress levels\n- Sleep patterns\n- Activities before episodes\n- Any other symptoms\n\n4. Request specific tests:\n- MRI with contrast\n- Extended EEG monitoring\n- Comprehensive vestibular testing\n\nThe recurring peripheral neuropathy with normal Vitamin D levels suggests there might be an underlying neurological condition that needs investigation. While specialty appointments are expensive, establishing the cause could prevent potential progression and provide peace of mind."

    "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "This is certainly a complex and concerning situation. Here's an analysis of the key points:\n\n1. The initial seizures appear to be related to postpartum complications, possibly connected to the spinal anesthesia from the C-section.\n\n2. Current symptoms that need attention:\n- Light sensitivity\n- Blurry vision\n- Deep sleep patterns\n- Full-body itching\n- Brief vibrating/shaking sensations\n- Memory issues\n\nThe itching could be:\n- A side effect of Phenytoin (a common occurrence)\n- An allergic reaction\n- Neurological in nature\n- Unrelated to the seizures or medication\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Contact her neurologist immediately about:\n- The new vibrating sensations (possible seizure activity)\n- The severe itching\n- The vision changes\n\n2. Consider:\n- Getting a second neurological opinion\n- Additional testing to rule out other conditions\n- Possible medication adjustment or change\n\nWhile MS is a possibility, many other conditions could cause these symptoms. It's important not to jump to conclusions but rather get proper medical evaluation.\n\nMonitor and document:\n- All symptoms\n- Time and duration of episodes\n- Any triggers or patterns\n- Sleep patterns\n- Medication timing and reactions\n\nThis information needs prompt medical attention to ensure proper treatment and prevent potential seizures."

I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute.

    "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents.

    "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your description, this sounds very similar to symptoms of hemiplegic migraine, a rare but serious type of migraine that can cause temporary weakness or numbness on one side of the body, along with other neurological symptoms. The progression you describe - the numbness spreading across exactly half the body, severe headache, light/sound sensitivity, and communication difficulties - are classic symptoms.\n\nYou should definitely:\n\n1. See a neurologist who specializes in migraines and headache disorders\n2. Keep a detailed log of when these episodes occur, including:\n   - What you were doing before\n   - What you ate\n   - Sleep patterns\n   - Stress levels\n   - Any potential triggers you notice\n\nHemiplegic migraines can be either familial (genetic) or sporadic. They require proper diagnosis and management because they can be serious, and there are specific treatments available.\n\nAlso worth noting: some types of seizures can present similarly, so it's important to get a proper differential diagnosis from a neurologist.\n\nThis isn't medical advice, but rather a suggestion for where to start looking and what to discuss with healthcare professionals.

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Diagnosis:\n- A normal EEG is a good sign, as epileptic activity typically shows up on EEG\n- The doctor's observation of your posture and movements leading to a tics diagnosis seems reasonable\n- Motor tics can indeed look similar to myoclonic jerks\n\n2. Medication explanation:\n- Clonazepam, while used for myoclonic epilepsy, is also commonly prescribed for:\n  * Tics\n  * Anxiety\n  * Movement disorders\n  * As a rescue medication for various conditions\n\n3. Treatment approach:\n- The combination of medications prescribed (Tetrabenazine, Clonidine, Clonazepam) is consistent with treating tics and ADHD\n\nHowever, you should:\n1. Discuss your concerns about epilepsy directly with your neurologist\n2. Ask about what signs/symptoms should prompt immediate medical attention\n3.

    "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",

    "answer": "Air hunger (dyspnea) is a known potential side effect of stimulant medications like Vyvanse. Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Contact your psychiatrist to inform them about this side effect, especially if it's severe or distressing.\n\n2. Some coping strategies you can try:\n- Practice relaxation techniques or deep breathing exercises\n- Stay well-hydrated\n- Ensure you're getting enough rest\n- Avoid caffeine as it might compound the effect\n- Try sitting upright or standing to optimize breathing\n\n3. Monitor when the air hunger occurs - is it worse at certain times of day or when the medication peaks?\n\n4. Consider if anxiety might be playing a role, as stimulants can sometimes increase anxiety which can cause similar symptoms.\n\nSince you're a singer, you might also want to:\n- Use your breath support training\n- Practice diaphragmatic breathing\n- Try gentle humming exercises\n\nIf the symptom becomes severe or is accompanied by chest pain or other concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nRemember: This is medical information, not advice.

What you're describing sounds like it could be focal seizures (also known as partial seizures), and the symptoms you've mentioned - particularly the aura, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, vision changes, and speech difficulties - are common symptoms of this type of seizure.\n\nWhile waiting for your neurologist appointment, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Keep a detailed seizure diary documenting:\n- Date and time of episodes\n- Duration\n- Specific symptoms\n- What you were doing before it happened\n- Any potential triggers (stress, lack of sleep, etc.)\n\n2. Basic safety measures:\n- Avoid driving until cleared by your doctor\n- Get adequate sleep\n- Avoid excessive alcohol\n- Try to manage stress\n- Have someone with you if possible\n\n3. For immediate episodes:\n- Find a safe place to sit or lie down\n- Turn on your side if possible\n- Have someone stay with you until it passes\n\nWhen you see the neurologist, they may recommend:\n- EEG (electroencephalogram)\n- MRI\n- Blood tests\n- Further neurological examination\n\nMake sure to tell your neurologist about both recent and past episodes in detail.\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific information about any of these points?"

    "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",

Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Keppra (levetiracetam) can indeed cause side effects like drowsiness, fatigue, and mental fog. Here are some considerations:\n\n1. Timing:\n- Taking Keppra before bed can help you sleep through some of the side effects\n- However, if you're only taking it once daily, it's important to maintain consistent timing as prescribed\n\n2. Food:\n- Keppra can be taken with or without food\n- Some people find taking it with food helps reduce stomach upset\n\nCommon recommendations:\n1. Consult your neurologist about:\n- Your current symptoms\n- Possibly adjusting your dosage\n- Alternative anti-epileptic medications\n- Whether once-daily dosing provides adequate seizure protection\n\n2. Keep a symptom diary to track:\n- When you feel most foggy\n- Relationship to medication timing\n- Any breakthrough seizure activity\n\nImportant notes:\n- Don't stop or change your medication without consulting your doctor\n- Splitting the dose might provide more consistent blood levels\n- Other anti-epileptic medications may have fewer side effects for you\n\nConsider discussing these concerns with your healthcare provider to find the optimal treatment plan for your situation."

    "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

    "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational. CT scans August 16th - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 1005.29 September 22nd - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 799 September 23rd - Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis Total Exam DLP: 652 September 25th - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 763 November 15th - Chest/abdomen/pelvis W contrast Total Exam DLP: 1291.11 CONTRAST: 80 mL of Iohexol Inj 80 mL November 18th - Full body PET scan Total Exam DLP: A fuck load December 15th - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 881.17",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Let me help put your concerns into perspective:\n\n1. Risk Context:\n- The typical background radiation exposure we all receive annually is about 3 mSv\n- A single CT head scan typically delivers 2-4 mSv\n- A chest/abdomen/pelvis CT typically delivers 10-20 mSv\n\n2. Comparison Points:\n- Radiation workers are limited to 50 mSv per year or 100 mSv over 5 years\n- Pilots receive additional 2-5 mSv per year from cosmic radiation\n- Radiation therapy patients often receive 60-80 Gy (60,000-80,000 mSv) to targeted areas\n\nYour total exposure, while higher than ideal, is still within reasonable medical limits. The benefits of accurate diagnosis in your case likely outweighed the risks, especially given your serious neurological symptoms.\n\nTo ease your mind:\n1. Cancer risk from medical imaging is theoretical and based on statistical models\n2. Your body has natural repair mechanisms for radiation damage\n3. The radiation exposure was spread over months, allowing recovery time\n4. At 32, your cells are still quite resilient\n\nMoving forward:\n- Keep records of your imaging\n- Inform healthcare providers of your previous scans\n- Focus on maintaining good overall health\n- Remember that stress about past exposure won't help - your attitude about looking forward is correct"

    "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "The vagus nerve isn't bullshit, but some claims about vagal stimulation may be overstated. Here's a balanced look:\n\nThe vagus nerve is real and important:\n- It's the longest cranial nerve, running from your brain through your chest and abdomen\n- Controls many involuntary body functions (parasympathetic nervous system)\n- Influences heart rate, digestion, inflammation, mood, and immune response\n\nScientifically supported benefits of vagal stimulation:\n- Can help reduce anxiety and stress\n- May improve heart rate variability\n- Can aid digestion\n- May reduce inflammation\n- FDA has approved vagal nerve stimulation devices for epilepsy and depression\n\nHowever:\n- Many popular \"vagal stimulation techniques\" lack strong scientific evidence\n- Benefits may be overstated in popular media\n- Some effects may be due to general relaxation rather than specific vagal stimulation\n\nSafe ways to potentially stimulate the vagus nerve:\n- Deep, slow breathing\n- Humming/singing\n- Cold exposure\n- Meditation\n- Gentle exercise\n\nWhile the vagus nerve is legitimately important, approach dramatic claims with healthy skepticism and consult healthcare providers before trying any intensive stimulation techniques."

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Yes, it's absolutely possible to have epilepsy without being sensitive to flashing lights. The sensitivity to flashing lights (called photosensitivity) only affects about 3-5% of people with epilepsy. \n\nBased on your description (childhood onset, occurring during sleep, and typically resolving in teenage years), you might have had what's called \"Benign Rolandic Epilepsy\" (also known as Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes or BECTS). This is one of the most common childhood epilepsy syndromes, and it:\n\n1. Typically begins in childhood\n2. Often occurs during sleep\n3. Usually resolves by age 13-15\n4. Doesn't typically include photosensitivity\n\nHowever, only a medical professional can make an accurate diagnosis. If you're concerned about your condition or want to confirm what type of epilepsy you had, it would be best to consult with a neurologist who can review your medical history."

I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your symptoms are indeed consistent with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). Here's why:\n\n1. The symptoms you described from childhood sound like possible focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures), which are common in TLE:\n- Strange sensory experiences\n- Altered perception of size (macropsia/micropsia)\n- Unexplained emotional responses\n- Frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences\n\n2. Your grand mal seizures (tonic-clonic seizures) could be focal seizures that spread to become generalized seizures, which is common in TLE.\n\n3. The abnormal EEG activity in the left side of your brain supports this possibility.\n\n4. The connection with mononucleosis is interesting because viral infections can sometimes trigger or be associated with seizure disorders.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Continue pursuing evaluation with an epilepsy specialist\n2. Keep a detailed diary of any unusual sensations or experiences\n3. Document potential triggers (lack of sleep, stress, illness)\n4. Share your childhood experiences with your new neurologist\n\nWhile this sounds consistent with TLE, only a qualified epilepsy specialist can make an official diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment. Be persistent in getting proper medical attention, as epilepsy typically requires ongoing management."

    "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Elevated eosinophil levels (eosinophilia) can be caused by several conditions:\n\n1. Allergic disorders\n- Asthma\n- Hay fever\n- Eczema\n- Drug allergies\n\n2. Autoimmune conditions\n- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n- Other vasculitis conditions\n\n3. Infections\n- Parasitic infections\n- Certain fungal infections\n\n4. Blood disorders\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome\n- Some types of leukemia\n\n5. Other causes\n- Certain medications\n- Addison's disease\n- Some types of cancer\n\nGiven that you're on multiple medications, it's worth discussing with your doctors whether any of these could be contributing to the elevated levels. The hematologist will likely perform additional tests to determine the underlying cause.\n\nImportant points to note:\n- Your levels are significantly elevated (22% vs normal \u22648%)\n- You have no obvious allergies or travel history\n- You're on multiple medications that could potentially affect blood counts\n\nThe hematologist will be best positioned to investigate the cause and recommend appropriate treatment if needed."

    "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",

    "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "It's understandable to be concerned. While I can provide general information, it's crucial to consult with a neurologist before proceeding with any stun gun exposure, as they can evaluate your specific medical history and risk factors.\n\nSome important points to consider:\n\n1. The relationship between stun guns and seizures is still being studied, but there have been some reported cases of seizures triggered by electrical weapons.\n\n2. Having a history of seizures, even if they occurred many years ago, could potentially increase your risk.\n\n3. The fact that your epilepsy was trauma-induced (rather than genetic) and hasn't recurred in over 20 years might be relevant to your risk assessment.\n\nFor your safety, you should:\n\n1. Consult with a neurologist about your specific situation\n2. Get medical clearance before proceeding\n3. Provide full disclosure to the employer about your medical history\n4. Consider discussing alternative testing options with the employer\n\nRemember, your health and safety should be the priority, and it's better to be cautious and get professional medical advice before proceeding."

I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Both of your questions touch on important potential connections. Let me address them separately:\n\n1. Inflammation and Epilepsy Connection:\n- Research has shown strong links between inflammation and epilepsy\n- Inflammatory processes can:\n  * Disrupt the blood-brain barrier\n  * Affect neurotransmitter function\n  * Create neuronal hyperexcitability\n  * Potentially trigger seizures\n\nSpecifically with Crohn's:\n- Inflammatory bowel diseases can increase systemic inflammation\n- This may increase the risk of neurological conditions, including epilepsy\n- Some studies suggest shared genetic and immune system factors\n\n2. Cysts and Inflammation Connection:\n- Chronic inflammation can contribute to cyst formation\n- Inflammatory processes can:\n  * Affect tissue repair\n  * Create fluid-filled spaces\n  * Disrupt normal cell growth patterns\n\nHowever, I'm not qualified to provide medical advice. I'd recommend:\n- Discussing these connections with your healthcare team\n- Considering consultation with a neurologist familiar with autoimmune conditions\n- Keeping detailed records of symptoms and timing to help identify patterns\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific information about any of these aspects?"

    "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described (dizziness, motor function issues, speech problems), I understand your doctor's thought process in prescribing Selenica-R (sodium valproate), as it's used not only for epilepsy but also for various neurological conditions.\n\nHowever, several points are worth noting:\n\n1. Your symptoms could be related to:\n- SSRI discontinuation syndrome (from stopping Zoloft/Lexapro)\n- Potential neurological conditions\n- Vestibular issues\n- Cervical spine problems\n- Anxiety manifestations\n\n2. Concerning the Selenica-R:\n- While it can be used for various neurological conditions, it would be important to have a clear diagnosis before starting this medication\n- The dosage and necessity should be carefully evaluated\n- Side effects should be discussed thoroughly\n\n3. Additional considerations:\n- 2000mg of magnesium is a relatively high dose and could potentially contribute to some symptoms\n- Have you been evaluated by a neurologist specifically?\n- Has vestibular rehabilitation therapy been considered?\n\nRecommendation:\nConsider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist who can provide a comprehensive evaluation. Given the complexity of your symptoms, it would be beneficial to have a clear diagnosis before starting medication like Selenica-R.\n\nAlways remember to discuss any concerns about prescribed medications with your healthcare provider or seek a second opinion if you're unsure."

    "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds. Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Let me address your questions about epilepsy:\n\n1. Can epilepsy occur without an obvious cause?\nYes, in many cases epilepsy can develop without a clear cause (called idiopathic epilepsy). However, it can also be caused by:\n- Brain injury\n- Stroke\n- Brain tumors\n- Infections\n- Genetic factors\n- Developmental disorders\n\n2. Regarding family history:\nHaving a relative with epilepsy slightly increases your risk, but it doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop it. The genetic component varies depending on the type of epilepsy. Your mom's cousin's children may have a somewhat higher risk, but it's not guaranteed they'll develop it.\n\n3. About medications and substances:\n- Some medications can lower the seizure threshold, including certain antidepressants\n- However, SSRIs like Citalopram are generally considered safe and have a low risk of causing seizures\n- Alcohol withdrawal can trigger seizures\n- Some recreational drugs can increase seizure risk\n\n4. For someone on HRT:\nHormone therapy generally doesn't increase epilepsy risk, but it's always good to discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.\n\nKeep in mind that having risk factors doesn't mean you'll develop epilepsy. If you're concerned, consult with a healthcare provider who knows your complete medical history."

    "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "While I understand your concern, it's important to note that sensitivity to flashing lights (photosensitivity) doesn't necessarily mean you have epilepsy. Many people without epilepsy can feel uncomfortable, dizzy, or \"off\" when exposed to intense flashing lights. This is actually quite common.\n\nHowever, please note:\n\n1. It was risky to test yourself with an epilepsy test video. In the future, avoid self-testing as it could be dangerous.\n\n2. Only about 3% of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy, and most people who develop epilepsy show symptoms before age 20.\n\n3. Common reactions to flashing lights in non-epileptic people can include:\n- Discomfort\n- Dizziness\n- Nausea\n- Headaches\n- Feeling \"off\" or anxious\n\nWatching the test video won't make you more susceptible to developing epilepsy.\n\nIf you're concerned, the best course of action is to:\n1. Avoid intense flashing lights\n2. Consult with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation\n3. Don't self-diagnose or self-test\n\nYour symptoms sound more like normal light sensitivity, but only a medical professional can make a proper diagnosis."

    "answer": "Yes, you should follow up with your doctor, especially since you're experiencing multiple episodes in one day. This represents a significant change in your symptoms, which your doctor specifically mentioned as a reason to return.\n\nWhile an MRI is an important diagnostic tool, it's important to note that:\n\n1. A normal MRI doesn't rule out epilepsy completely\n2. Some people with epilepsy have normal MRIs\n3.

However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don\u2019t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It\u2019s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit! All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Here's what I can tell you about epilepsy and alcohol consumption:\n\n1. The reason doctors likely avoid giving a definitive answer is because alcohol's effects on epilepsy can vary significantly between individuals.\n\n2. Major risks of alcohol consumption with epilepsy include:\n- Disrupted sleep patterns (especially relevant for nocturnal epilepsy)\n- Missed medication due to drinking\n- Reduced effectiveness of anti-epileptic medications\n- Increased seizure risk during withdrawal periods\n\n3. Your current behavior is risky because:\n- You're exceeding medical recommendations\n- Nocturnal epilepsy could be particularly sensitive to alcohol's effects on sleep\n- Alcohol can interact with both clobazam and carbamazepole (Tegretol)\n\nWhile you may have been fine so far, this doesn't guarantee future safety.

    "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",

Long-term risks:\n- Some studies suggest increased risk of:\n  * Memory problems\n  * Cognitive decline\n  * Depression and anxiety\n  * In some cases, increased risk of dementia\n  * Potential for brain cell loss in certain areas\n\n3. Prevention is crucial:\n- Your system of monitoring the three factors (sleep, medication, stress) is very good\n- Medication compliance is especially important\n- Regular sleep patterns help reduce risk\n- Stress management is beneficial\n\n4. Positive factors:\n- Being well-controlled on medication reduces risks\n- Having fewer seizures means less potential for damage\n- Modern anti-epileptic drugs are generally protective\n\nYou should seek a second opinion or different neurologist if your current doctor isn't addressing your concerns. It's important to have a medical provider who will take time to answer your questions and help you understand your condition better.\n\nRemember: this is general information. Your specific case should be discussed with a qualified healthcare provider."

    "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your concerns are understandable. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Absence Seizures vs. Normal Spacing Out:\n- Normal spacing out/daydreaming is common and usually can be interrupted\n- Absence seizures typically last 10-15 seconds, person cannot be \"snapped out\" of them\n- During true absence seizures, people cannot recall what happened during the episode\n\n2. The \"What?\" Phenomenon:\n- This is actually very common and not necessarily related to seizures\n- It's often called \"auditory processing delay\" - where you need a moment to process what you heard\n\n3. Late Diagnosis Possibility:\n- While less common, it is possible to be diagnosed with epilepsy later in life\n- Some people have mild forms that go unnoticed for years\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Document these episodes (frequency, duration, circumstances)\n2. Keep your EEG appointment\n3. Consider discussing ADHD with your doctor as some symptoms overlap\n4. Share these specific examples with your neurologist\n\nOnly a medical professional can properly diagnose your condition after appropriate testing. The sleep-deprived EEG will help provide more clarity about your situation.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these points in more detail?"

    "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your symptoms and test results, you have low folate and ferritin levels, which can indeed cause fatigue, paleness, and other symptoms you've described. Here's some key information:\n\n1. Connection between folate and iron deficiency:\n- Both can occur together because poor absorption of one nutrient can affect the absorption of others\n- Some conditions that affect nutrient absorption can impact multiple nutrients\n- Certain medications can affect absorption of multiple nutrients\n\n2. Regarding your epilepsy:\n- Low folate levels can potentially lower the seizure threshold\n- It's worth discussing with your neurologist\n- While Keppra is generally less likely to affect folate levels than other anticonvulsants, individual responses can vary\n\n3. Despite your seemingly healthy diet:\n- Absorption issues can occur even with adequate intake\n- Some people need higher amounts of certain nutrients\n- Medical conditions or medications can affect absorption\n- Stress, exercise, and other factors can increase requirements\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Keep your appointment with your GP\n2. Consider asking about:\n- Potential causes of both deficiencies\n- Whether you should consult your neurologist\n- Appropriate supplementation\n- Further testing if needed\n\nYour diet sounds healthy, so there might be an underlying absorption issue worth investigating."

    "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",

    "answer": "I understand your concerns as a parent. While I can't provide medical advice, I can share some general information to help you better understand the situation:\n\n1. EEG Findings:\n- Abnormal EEG patterns can persist even between seizures\n- These patterns are often indicative of underlying electrical activity in the brain that predisposes to seizures\n\n2. Development Concerns:\n- Having an abnormal EEG doesn't necessarily mean previous development was affected\n- Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent impact on future development\n\n3. Further Testing:\n- Getting an MRI is a reasonable request if you're concerned\n- Second opinions are always acceptable, especially for new diagnoses\n- The planned video EEG will provide more detailed information\n\n4. Regarding Depakote:\n- It's a well-established medication with decades of use\n- Regular monitoring can help manage potential side effects\n- Alternative medications exist if Depakote isn't tolerated well\n\n5. Alternative Treatments:\n- Always discuss alternative treatments with your neurologist\n- CBD should only be used under medical supervision\n- Never stop prescribed medications without medical guidance\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Seek a second opinion if you're uncomfortable\n2. Keep detailed records of any side effects\n3. Consider consulting a pediatric epilepsy specialist\n4.

    "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your description, here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. Delayed Pain After Accident:\n- It's common for some injuries to become apparent weeks or months after an accident\n- The pain you're experiencing could be from:\n  * Bruised or fractured ribs\n  * Soft tissue damage\n  * Intercostal muscle strain\n  * Pleurisy (as you mentioned)\n  * Costochondritis (inflammation of cartilage connecting ribs to breastbone)\n\n2. Concerning Symptoms:\nThe pressure sensation around your heart and lung is something that should ideally be evaluated professionally, especially given the trauma history. Without proper imaging, it's impossible to rule out:\n- Hairline rib fractures\n- Pleural effusion\n- Lung contusion\n- Cardiac contusion\n\n3. Current Treatment Approach:\nYour current management seems appropriate:\n- Anti-inflammatory steroids\n- Menthol patches\n- Analgesic cream\n\n4. Recommendations:\n- Monitor for worsening symptoms\n- Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:\n  * Difficulty breathing\n  * Chest pain that worsens significantly\n  * Fever\n  * Coughing up blood\n- Consider looking into:\n  * Local free clinics\n  * Hospital financial assistance programs\n  * Medical bill payment plans\n  * Community health centers\n\nGiven the location and nature of the pain, along with the accident history, it would be ideal to get imaging done when possible to ensure there's no underlying serious injury."

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Given your situation, pursuing these diagnostic tests is a reasonable step to explore surgical options. Here's why:\n\n1. Your age (16) is actually advantageous for potential surgery, as younger patients often have better outcomes.\n\n2. You have a specific type of epilepsy (frontal lobe) which means the seizures have a localized origin - this can make you a better candidate for surgical intervention.\n\n3. The tests (PET, CT, and MRI) are standard diagnostic tools that help doctors:\n- Locate the exact area causing seizures\n- Determine if surgery is viable\n- Plan the safest surgical approach if you're eligible\n\nWhile your fear is completely understandable:\n\n1. These tests are performed under medical supervision\n2. The medical team will be prepared to handle any seizures\n3. The risk of SUDEP during monitored testing is extremely low\n\nPotential benefits:\n- Could lead to significant reduction or elimination of seizures\n- Might reduce medication dependency\n- Could improve quality of life\n\nConsider that:\n- Even if surgery isn't recommended, the information gained can help optimize your treatment\n- You're not committing to surgery by doing the tests\n- Knowledge is power in managing your condition\n\nDiscuss your specific concerns with your medical team - they can explain safety protocols and help you make an informed decision."

    "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here's a professional perspective, though this isn't a substitute for direct medical advice:\n\nThe head movements you described could indeed be seizure activity, specifically:\n- The side-to-side head movements while unresponsive suggest possible complex partial seizures\n- The progression to uncontrolled seizures indicates she likely experienced status epilepticus\n\nRegarding her initial condition:\n- High fever (39.7\u00b0C) followed by neurological symptoms suggests possible encephalitis\n- Despite negative tests for autoimmune encephalitis, the response to IVIG and steroids suggests an inflammatory process\n- Temporal lobe focus is consistent with her current seizure presentation\n\nCurrent medication regimen:\n- She's on a robust combination of AEDs targeting different mechanisms\n- The doses appear appropriate but relatively high\n- Adding Vimpat (lacosamide) could be reasonable given continued seizures\n\nSuggestions to discuss with her healthcare team:\n1. Consider long-term EEG monitoring\n2. Possible repeat imaging to check for subtle changes\n3. Regular therapeutic drug monitoring\n4. Review triggers (sleep deprivation, stress, etc.)\n\nWould strongly recommend maintaining detailed seizure records and considering second opinion from an epileptologist if not already involved."

    "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your concern is completely valid, and it's good that you're taking this seriously. What you've described does sound like they could have been seizures, particularly given the presence of an aura (warning sensation), loss of consciousness, convulsions, and post-ictal symptoms.\n\nYou should definitely consult a neurologist about these episodes, even though they happened years ago. Here's why:\n\n1. Having had two unprovoked seizures does meet one of the criteria for an epilepsy diagnosis\n2. Even if seizures are infrequent, understanding their cause is important for your health and safety\n3. There might be triggers you should be aware of or avoid\n4. Some activities (like driving) may be affected by a seizure disorder diagnosis\n5. If you do have epilepsy, medication might be recommended to prevent future seizures\n\nTo diagnose epilepsy, a neurologist would typically:\n- Take a detailed medical history\n- Perform a neurological exam\n- Possibly order tests like an EEG or brain imaging\n\nIt's worth noting that not all seizures are epileptic - they can sometimes be triggered by specific events (like head trauma) without indicating epilepsy. However, this is something a medical professional should determine.\n\nWhile you shouldn't panic, it would be wise to seek medical evaluation to better understand your situation and ensure your safety."

    "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "While I understand your hesitation to discuss this with your neurologist, this is an important medical concern that should ultimately be discussed with your healthcare providers. However, I can provide some general information:\n\nBoth Depakote (valproate) and Keppra (levetiracetam) generally have fewer interactions with hormone therapy compared to some other anticonvulsants. Unlike enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (like carbamazepine or phenytoin), they don't significantly affect hormone metabolism.\n\nKey points:\n1. Keppra has minimal drug interactions and doesn't significantly affect hormone levels\n2. Depakote may slightly affect hormone metabolism but is generally considered compatible with HRT\n3. The estrogen in HRT can affect the metabolism of some anticonvulsants, but this effect is minimal with your current medications\n\nHowever, hormonal changes of any kind can potentially affect seizure threshold. This isn't necessarily due to drug interactions but rather the general effects of hormones on neurological function.\n\nFor optimal care, consider:\n1. Working with both an epileptologist and an endocrinologist familiar with transgender care\n2. Regular monitoring of both anticonvulsant levels and hormone levels\n3. Gradual hormone dose adjustments if needed\n\nRemember, this is general information and individual responses can vary. A frank discussion with your healthcare providers would ensure safe and effective treatment."

It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

    "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Valproic acid (VPA) can indeed have multiple effects on behavior and cognition, even at low doses. Here are several potential explanations for the changes you've observed:\n\n1. Cognitive Effects:\n- VPA can cause cognitive dulling and mild sedation\n- Even at low doses, it may affect attention and processing speed\n- Some patients experience \"mental fog\" that they only recognize after discontinuing the medication\n\n2. Neurotransmitter Impact:\n- VPA affects GABA levels in the brain\n- It can influence various neurotransmitter systems\n- These changes might affect social awareness and emotional processing\n\n3. Side Effects on Development:\n- In young children, even mild cognitive effects might impact learning and social development\n- The medication period coincided with important developmental years\n- The \"dampening\" effect might have masked natural emotional development\n\nThe increased emotional range you're now seeing (including occasional mood swings) might represent:\n- Natural emotional development that was previously suppressed\n- Better ability to process and respond to environmental stimuli\n- More typical child development patterns\n\nIt's worth discussing these observations with her healthcare providers, as they might provide valuable insight for future treatment decisions.\n\nNote: This information is meant to provide context but not medical advice. Always consult with healthcare providers about medication effects."

    "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Let me break this down for you:\n\nSpike and wave discharges are abnormal electrical patterns in the brain that are commonly associated with epilepsy. They can occur even when you're not having a visible seizure.\n\nThe location described in your EEG refers to:\n- Right frontotemporal: the right side of your brain, in the front and temporal (side) areas\n- Central regions: middle area of the brain\n- Maximally frontal: meaning the strongest activity was in the front of the brain\n\nThese findings suggest epileptiform activity (patterns associated with epilepsy) in these regions, even though you didn't have a seizure during the recording. This kind of activity can help doctors:\n1. Confirm an epilepsy diagnosis\n2. Identify where seizures might be originating\n3. Help guide treatment decisions\n\nHowever, for a complete interpretation and understanding of what this means for your specific case, you should discuss these results with your neurologist when possible."

    "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

    "answer": "I understand you're in a difficult situation. Here are some potential options to consider:\n\n1. Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid program):\n- Even with your current income, you might qualify for Medi-Cal if you can demonstrate medical necessity\n- Contact your local county human services agency\n- Ask specifically about medical hardship provisions\n\n2. Hospital Financial Assistance:\n- Many hospitals have charity care programs\n- Request a financial assistance application for your $5000 ER bill\n- Some hospitals will reduce or eliminate bills based on income and circumstances\n\n3. Disability Options:\n- State Disability Insurance (SDI) through California\n- Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) - while harder to get under 50, neurological conditions can qualify\n- Get documentation from both Mexican and US doctors translated\n\n4. Community Health Centers:\n- Look for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in San Diego\n- They often offer sliding scale fees based on income\n- May help coordinate care and insurance options\n\n5. Additional Resources:\n- Contact the Epilepsy Foundation of San Diego for support and resources\n- 211 San Diego for local health and social services\n- Patient Advocate Foundation for assistance navigating healthcare options\n\nWhen speaking with county workers:\n- Emphasize the medical emergency\n- Bring all medical documentation (get translations)\n- Ask about temporary or emergency medical assistance programs\n- Inquire about retroactive coverage options\n\nConsider documenting your symptoms and seizures carefully, as this may help with both medical care and potential disability claims."

    "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Your situation sounds complex and understandably confusing. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. It's possible to have both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures (also called PNES - Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures)\n\n2. The presence of your typical aura before these episodes is noteworthy, as auras are typically associated with epileptic seizures. However, people with both conditions may experience similar sensations\n\n3. The different presentation and work-specific occurrence suggests a possible stress trigger, which is common with PNES\n\n4. Yes, some people with PNES can be aware they're having non-epileptic seizures\n\nThe best course of action would be to:\n- Document these episodes (time, place, triggers, symptoms)\n- Discuss these changes with your neurologist\n- Consider video EEG monitoring to help differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic events\n\nGiven your complex medical history, only a healthcare provider can properly diagnose whether these are new seizure manifestations or PNES. Please consult your neurologist about these changes."

    "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Yes, it's entirely possible that the anti-epileptic medications were helping to stabilize your mood. Many anti-epileptic drugs are also used as mood stabilizers in psychiatric treatment. For example:\n\n1. Lamotrigine is commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder\n2. Topiramate can help with mood stability\n3. Epilim (sodium valproate) is also used as a mood stabilizer\n\nWhen you stopped these medications, it may have unmasked underlying mood issues that were being partially treated by these drugs. The pattern you're describing - cycling between depression and periods of elevated mood with reckless behavior - sounds similar to bipolar disorder symptoms.\n\nGiven your current symptoms, it would be advisable to:\n\n1. Consult a psychiatrist who can properly evaluate your mood patterns\n2. Discuss your history with anti-epileptic medications\n3. Consider whether a mood stabilizer might be appropriate for your situation\n\nPlease take your mood changes seriously and seek professional help, especially given your recent crisis. A mental health professional can work with you to find the right treatment approach.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not medical advice. Please consult with healthcare professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment."

    "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I\u2019m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn\u2019t have any \u201cepisodes\u201d yesterday, but couldn\u2019t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I\u2019m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr\u2019s that they might not be considering as an option.",

    "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on your complex medical history, here's my analysis:\n\n1. A neuropsychological evaluation would likely be most beneficial as your first step because it can:\n- Assess cognitive functions comprehensively\n- Help differentiate between neurological and psychological causes\n- Provide objective data about any lasting effects from seizures\n- Guide treatment decisions\n\n2. The multiple factors that could be contributing to your symptoms include:\n- Early childhood seizures and potential developmental impacts\n- Traumatic brain injury from the riding accident\n- PTSD\n- Possible continued subclinical seizure activity\n\n3. Long-term consequences of early childhood seizures can include:\n- Memory issues\n- Attention/concentration difficulties\n- Processing speed changes\n- Anxiety and depression\n- Fatigue\n\n4. Regarding your epilepsy prognosis:\n- A normal EEG is very positive\n- However, given your extensive early history, continued neurological monitoring would be prudent\n\nRecommendation:\nStart with a neuropsychological evaluation, as this will provide the most comprehensive assessment and can help direct further treatment decisions, whether neurological or psychological.\n\nThis approach would be most cost-effective as it can guide more targeted interventions rather than pursuing multiple specialists simultaneously."

    "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",

    "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",

    "answer": "Based on your detailed description, there are several aspects that suggest this might be more complex than simple vasovagal syncope:\n\n1. The strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu sensation and feeling of unreality before episodes\n2. Memory issues (both short and medium-term)\n3. Post-episode symptoms\n4. The pattern related to menstrual cycle\n5. Increasing frequency of episodes\n6. Occurrence in various positions\n7. Cardiac pauses (which could be primary or secondary)\n\nThese symptoms, particularly the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and memory issues, could indeed suggest temporal lobe involvement. Some possibilities to consider:\n\n1. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):\n- The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, memory issues, and autonomic symptoms fit\n- Can cause ictal bradycardia and asystole\n- Often has a hormonal connection\n\n2. Autonomic dysfunction:\n- Could explain the cardiac pauses\n- May have hormonal influences\n- Can worsen over time\n\nWhile waiting for your neurology appointment:\n\n1. Keep a detailed diary of:\n- Episodes (time, position, activities)\n- Menstrual cycle\n- Sleep patterns\n- Stress levels\n- What you ate/drank\n- Any triggers you notice\n\n2. If possible, have someone video record an episode\n\n3. Consider asking for:\n- EEG monitoring\n- Brain MRI if not done recently\n- Hormonal workup\n- Autonomic function testing\n\nIt's reasonable to seek a second opinion and push for a more comprehensive evaluation beyond just the cardiac aspect."

I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

    "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",

    "answer": "Based on your description, this sounds like it could be Vasovagal Syncope, which is the most common cause of fainting. The symptoms you describe (feeling hot, dizzy, clammy before fainting) are typical of this condition. The triggers you mentioned (heat, dehydration, pain) are also common triggers for vasovagal episodes.\n\nOn airplanes specifically, several factors can increase the risk:\n- Lower cabin pressure and oxygen levels\n- Prolonged sitting\n- Dehydration from dry cabin air\n- Disrupted sleep patterns\n\nYour current prevention strategies are good. Here are additional suggestions:\n\n1. Medical:\n- Consider asking your doctor about midodrine or other medications that can help prevent fainting\n- Ensure your thyroid levels are well-controlled, as thyroid issues can affect blood pressure\n\n2. During flight:\n- Do frequent leg exercises in your seat\n- Get up and walk when possible (every 2-3 hours)\n- Consider an aisle seat for easier movement\n- Alert flight attendants about your condition before takeoff\n- Keep a small fan for air circulation\n- Consider wearing a medical alert bracelet\n\n3. Prevention:\n- Increase salt intake 24-48 hours before flight\n- Practice counter-pressure maneuvers (tensing legs, crossing ankles)\n- Try to maintain regular sleep schedule before travel\n- Consider wearing an abdominal binder\n\nYou might want to ask your doctor about tilt-table testing to confirm if it's vasovagal syncope and discuss specific treatment options."

    "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",

While I can't diagnose you, I can share some relevant information:\n\n1. The connection between epilepsy and fatigue:\n- Post-ictal fatigue (after seizures) is common\n- Many people with epilepsy report chronic fatigue\n- Research suggests epilepsy can affect mitochondrial function (energy production in cells)\n\n2. Medication effects:\n- Keppra (levetiracetam) can cause fatigue as a side effect\n- Some anti-epileptic drugs can affect metabolism\n\n3. Autoimmune connections:\n- There are known autoimmune epilepsies\n- Some research suggests gut health may influence both seizures and energy levels\n- Inflammation can play a role in both epilepsy and fatigue\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Seek a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy (epileptologist)\n2. Request testing for autoimmune markers\n3. Consider keeping a detailed symptom diary\n4. Look into getting a second opinion\n\nYour experience sounds valid and deserves proper medical attention. The relationship between exercise intolerance and epilepsy is complex and not fully understood by many healthcare providers."

    "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",

    "answer": "This sounds like a concerning situation that requires medical attention, which you're already seeking with a neurologist - that's good. While I can't diagnose you, I can share some relevant information:\n\nYour symptoms could potentially be related to:\n\n1. Delayed reaction to nitrous oxide (laughing gas):\n- Can occasionally cause neurological symptoms\n- May deplete vitamin B12 levels, which can cause neurological issues\n\n2. Possible seizure activity:\n- Your \"freezing\" episodes could be focal seizures\n- The initial episode has some characteristics of a complex partial seizure\n\n3. Non-epileptic seizures (PNES):\n- Can be triggered by stressful events\n- Present similarly to epileptic seizures\n\nImportant steps you're already taking:\n- Seeing a neurologist\n- Getting medical attention promptly\n- Documenting your symptoms\n\nSuggestions while waiting for your appointment:\n1. Keep a detailed log of episodes\n2. Have someone video record an episode if possible\n3. Avoid driving until cleared by your doctor\n4. Consider having someone stay with you\n\nSeek immediate medical attention if:\n- Episodes become more frequent/severe\n- You develop new concerning symptoms\n- You feel unsafe\n\nThese symptoms warrant thorough neurological evaluation, which you're pursuing. Make sure to tell your neurologist about all details of the initial dental visit and subsequent symptoms."

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it's understandable why you're concerned. Let me break this down:\n\nYour symptoms could indeed be largely related to stress and anxiety, which can cause many physical symptoms. Here's why:\n\n1. Stress-related symptoms:\n- Phantom smells (phantosmia)\n- Muscle twitches\n- Headaches\n- Lightheadedness\n- Brain fog/difficulty finding words\n- Dissociation (\"staring through things\")\n\n2. Normal/Common phenomena:\n- Eye floaters (especially visible in sunlight)\n- Tinnitus (high-pitched noise in ears)\n- Brief memory lapses\n\nImportant points:\n- The clean EEG is reassuring\n- Your GP's lack of concern is positive\n- The timing coinciding with high stress/breakup is significant\n- Your existing anxiety/depression can amplify physical symptoms\n\nPotential contributing factors:\n- Low iron levels\n- Dental infection (decaying tooth)\n- Severe anxiety\n- Depression\n- Recent emotional trauma\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Address dental issues (infected teeth can cause various symptoms)\n2. Get iron levels checked/treated\n3. Consider counseling/therapy for stress management\n4. Have an eye exam for the floaters/flashes\n5. Continue monitoring symptoms with your GP\n\nWhile brain tumors are scary, your symptoms are more consistent with stress/anxiety, especially given the timing and circumstances. However, if symptoms worsen or new ones develop, always follow up with your healthcare provider."

With Ramadan approaching I was wondering how much time there needs to be in between taking one pill at night and one in the morning, thanks.Let me know if I need to add anything else.",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "The typical recommendation for Keppra (levetiracetam) is to take doses approximately 12 hours apart. However, since this involves anti-seizure medication, it's very important to:\n\n1. Consult your neurologist or prescribing doctor before making any changes to your medication schedule during Ramadan\n\n2. Discuss with them specifically about safe timing between doses during fasting hours\n\nSince anti-seizure medications are crucial for seizure control, your doctor might need to adjust your dosing schedule or provide specific guidance for the fasting period.\n\nFor accurate medical guidance, please provide your doctor with:\n- Your usual medication timing\n- Your planned fasting schedule\n- Any history of seizures\n- Other medications you take\n\nKeep in mind that some scholars provide exemptions from fasting for people with medical conditions that require strict medication schedules."

    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Hickies (also known as love bites or kiss marks) are generally not dangerous for most people. They are simply broken blood vessels under the skin caused by suction, similar to a bruise. However, there are some rare cases where excessive force during the creation of a hickey could potentially cause problems:\n\n1. Very rare complications that have been reported:\n- Blood clots (extremely rare)\n- Minor nerve damage (temporary)\n- Stroke (extremely rare and usually requires other underlying conditions)\n\n2. Basic safety guidelines:\n- Avoid extremely forceful suction\n- Don't allow hickies near major arteries (especially on the neck)\n- If you experience unusual pain or symptoms, seek medical attention\n\nGiven your medical history (epilepsy and anxiety), it's always best to:\n1. Be moderate with any physical activity\n2. Consult your doctor if you have specific concerns\n3. Be aware of your body's reactions\n\nWhile the risks are generally very low, being mindful and avoiding excessive force is recommended.

Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "The symptoms you're describing - intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu followed by disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and confusion - could be consistent with temporal lobe seizures or focal seizures. These types of seizures don't necessarily involve convulsions and can present with the exact symptoms you've described.\n\nThe ability to \"control\" or anticipate the progression of symptoms, the vivid dream recall, and the sensation of knowing what comes next are also commonly reported features of temporal lobe seizures.\n\nThis is something you should discuss with a neurologist, especially since:\n1. It started in childhood\n2. Has a clear pattern\n3. Includes physical symptoms beyond just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n4. Affects your ability to function normally for a period afterward\n\nWhile d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu alone can be normal, the combination of symptoms you're describing warrants professional evaluation. A neurologist can perform tests like an EEG to determine if these episodes are seizure-related and recommend appropriate treatment if necessary.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some of your medications (particularly Wellbutrin and Vyvanse) can lower the seizure threshold in some people, which might be relevant to discuss with your healthcare provider."

Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
    "pictures": {},
    "answer": "Yes, it's possible that your symptoms could be related to vagal nerve stimulation triggered by the combination of your hiatal hernia, GERD, and weightlifting. Here's why:\n\n1. Vagal nerve involvement:\n- Weightlifting can increase intra-abdominal pressure\n- This pressure can affect your hiatal hernia and trigger vagal nerve stimulation\n- The vagus nerve regulates heart rate and blood pressure\n\n2. Vasovagal syncope:\n- Can cause fainting due to sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure\n- Often triggered by physical strain\n- Can sometimes appear similar to seizures (convulsive syncope)\n\n3. PPI long-term use:\n- May affect mineral absorption (especially magnesium)\n- Could contribute to cardiac rhythm issues\n- May influence blood pressure regulation\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Consult a gastroenterologist familiar with GERD/hernia exercise complications\n2. Consider keeping a detailed workout/symptom diary\n3. Modify exercise technique to reduce abdominal pressure\n4.
