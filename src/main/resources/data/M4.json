    "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about the issues you're going through. Given the range of tests you’ve already undergone and the fact that everything came back normal, it's clear your medical team is being thorough. It sounds like the situation is frustrating, especially since you didn’t have these symptoms before. ### A Few Considerations: 1. **Eyestrain and Visual Fatigue**: Since your neurologists suggested eyestrain as a potential cause, this might still be worth considering. Extended exposure to screens, especially fast-paced games with flashing lights and movements, can sometimes strain the eyes, causing dizziness or disorientation. It might also trigger discomfort if you’ve recently become more sensitive to the screen. Here are a few things to try: * **Take Frequent Breaks**: Every 20-30 minutes, look away from the screen (or get up and walk around). * **Adjust Lighting**: Make sure your room is adequately lit to reduce contrast between the screen and surroundings. * **Blue Light Filters**: Using software to reduce blue light or physical filters for your screen may help reduce strain. 2. **Anxiety and Dissociation**: Anxiety can have physical manifestations, including dizziness, disorientation, or a feeling of detachment from reality (dissociation). It's also possible that the heightened anxiety from your seizure episode is still affecting you. Anxiety can be triggered by gaming if it's stressful or involves fast reactions and high tension (like in games such as *Valorant* or *Apex Legends*). It may also be contributing to how you’re feeling during and after the games. Here are a few tips to manage that: * **Mindfulness Techniques**: Practice deep breathing, grounding exercises, or meditation to calm your nerves before and after gaming. * **Shorter Sessions**: Limit your gaming sessions to shorter periods and avoid late-night gaming, as fatigue can make anxiety worse. 3. **Sensitivity to Visual Stimuli**: You mentioned going to parties and concerts, where flashing lights are common, and that you're used to them. However, this experience might have changed now, and the intensity of the flashing lights and quick movements in games could be overstimulating your brain, especially since you’ve recently had a seizure. While you might not have epilepsy, this could still be a form of overstimulation. Try adjusting the **brightness** and **visual effects** in your games, or even experiment with reducing motion or flashing effects to see if it helps. 4. **Sleep and Recovery**: If your sleep pattern has been disrupted due to anxiety, gaming at night, or general stress, it could contribute to your dizziness and disorientation. Ensuring you get enough rest is crucial for managing anxiety and preventing overstimulation. 5. **Monitor Hydration and Nutrition**: Dehydration and low blood sugar can contribute to dizziness. Make sure you're staying well-hydrated and eating regularly, especially before playing games. ### What to Try: * **Limit gaming sessions** to 30 minutes with breaks. * **Set a timer** to remind yourself to take breaks, stretch, and relax your eyes. * **Lower in-game visual effects** or adjust settings like motion blur and brightness. * Consider switching to games with less intense visual stimulation to see if it helps. * If anxiety is playing a role, **relaxation techniques** like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation might help. * **Check in with a therapist**: Since you're experiencing dissociation and anxiety, it could help to talk with a mental health professional who can assist in working through the emotional aspect. If the symptoms persist or worsen, you may want to consider following up with your neurologists to see if further evaluation is necessary, particularly focusing on the sensory overstimulation or vestibular system, which controls balance. If you need specific recommendations on relaxation exercises or visual modifications for gaming, I’m happy to help!",

    "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
    "answer": "Short answer: Very likely yes.\n\nWhy:\n- Epilepsy is diagnosed when someone has either:\n  - at least two unprovoked seizures >24 hours apart, or\n  - one unprovoked seizure with a high risk of recurrence, or\n  - an epilepsy syndrome.\n- The events you describe (loss of consciousness, an “ictal cry”/suppressed scream, tongue biting, several minutes of confusion afterward) are classic for generalized tonic‑clonic seizures.\n- Sleep deprivation, alcohol, bright/flashing lights, heat/cold exposure, and cannabis can lower the seizure threshold but usually do not make a seizure “provoked” in the way that excludes epilepsy (like severe electrolyte disturbance, acute head injury, or alcohol withdrawal would). So your two events are best considered unprovoked seizures separated by years, which meets criteria for epilepsy.\n- Normal MRI and EEG do not rule out epilepsy. Many people with epilepsy have normal studies between seizures.\n\nWhy only twice in 2.5 years:\n- Seizure threshold varies day to day. You can be exposed to triggers many times without a seizure and then have one when multiple factors line up (sleep loss, dehydration, temperature stress, substances, etc.).\n- The fact that you’ve been seizure‑free for ~3 years after starting lamotrigine supports an epileptic cause that’s being controlled.\n\nA few considerations and next steps:\n- Medication: Lamotrigine 50 mg/day is on the low side for typical maintenance dosing in adults, but if you’re truly seizure‑free and tolerating it, your neurologist may have tailored it to you. Don’t change the dose without medical advice.\n- If you’re thinking about stopping medication: discuss with your neurologist. After 2–5 years seizure‑free, some people consider a slow taper, but relapse risk is roughly 30–40%. A repeat EEG can help with risk stratification.\n- Safety: Until your treating clinician confirms your driving status, follow local driving laws for epilepsy (often 6–12 months seizure‑free). Avoid swimming alone, climbing heights, locking bathroom doors, and baths (showers are safer).\n- Reduce risk: prioritize regular sleep, hydration, meals; limit alcohol; be cautious with cannabis/high‑THC products; avoid flashing lights if you notice sensitivity.\n- If episodes ever recur or seem different (no post‑event confusion, occur during exertion with palpitations, or frequent brief blackouts), ask about cardiac evaluation (ambulatory ECG) to exclude arrhythmia, which can mimic seizures.\n\nIf you can, clarify for your neurologist:\n- Did witnesses see stiffening and rhythmic jerking? Eye deviation? Cyanosis? Urinary incontinence? Was the tongue bite on the side (more specific for seizures) or the tip?\n- Any warning symptoms (odd smell/taste, déjà vu, rising stomach sensation) before events?\n\nBottom line: Your history fits two unprovoked generalized seizures with long post‑event confusion, which fulfills criteria for epilepsy despite normal tests. You’re doing well on treatment; continue follow‑up with your neurologist for individualized advice on dosing, driving, and any future taper.",

Any existing relevant medical issues bone infection (being treated) chest pain after 3 epilepsy attacks within 2 weeks and every time under influence of drugs, thats what worries me.Current medications 3 types of antibiotics.  Include a photo if relevant",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing those details. Chest pain after seizures—especially when drugs were involved—and while on multiple antibiotics needs in‑person evaluation.\n\nGo to urgent care or an emergency department today, and call emergency services now if any of the following are true:\n- Chest pain is ongoing, severe, pressure-like, or radiates to arm/jaw/back, or you’re short of breath, sweaty, dizzy, or feel faint\n- Fast or irregular heartbeat, new confusion, fever, coughing up blood, or worsening pain with breathing\n- You had trauma during a seizure (possible rib fracture, pneumothorax), or pain is sharp and worse with deep breaths\n\nWhy this matters:\n- Stimulant drugs (cocaine/amphetamines/MDMA) can trigger heart attack or dangerous rhythms.\n- Seizures plus drugs can cause muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis), lactic acidosis, or aspiration pneumonia (pleuritic chest pain, fever, cough).\n- Some antibiotics lower the seizure threshold and/or prolong the QT interval (risking arrhythmias), especially fluoroquinolones and macrolides; linezolid can interact with serotonergic/stimulant drugs.\n\nWhat to expect at urgent care/ED:\n- ECG and heart enzymes (troponin)\n- Chest X‑ray and oxygen level\n- Blood tests: electrolytes, kidney function, CK (rhabdomyolysis), magnesium; consider D‑dimer if PE suspected\n\nSeizure and medication safety now:\n- Do not use any recreational drugs or alcohol. Stay well hydrated and rested.\n- Do not drive, swim alone, or operate machinery until you’re cleared by a clinician (local laws often require a seizure‑free interval).\n- Do not stop antibiotics on your own, but bring the exact names/doses so the team can check for interactions and seizure risk.\n- You’ve had 3 seizures in 2 weeks—contact neurology urgently to discuss starting or adjusting antiseizure medication.\n\nPlease reply with:\n- Exact chest pain details: when it started relative to the seizures, location, character (pressure/sharp), duration, what makes it better/worse, any radiation, shortness of breath, cough/fever, palpitations, nausea/sweating, or fainting\n- Which recreational drugs and how recently (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, cannabis, opioids, alcohol)\n- Names/doses of the 3 antibiotics\n- Any injury during seizures, fever, or colored sputum\n\nIf symptoms are present now or worsening, seek emergency care immediately.",

    "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I’m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I’m wondering why. I’ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I’m just wondering if there’s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn’t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
    "answer": "Short answer: There isn’t a universal, medical “never donate” rule for people with well‑controlled epilepsy. Many blood/plasma organizations will accept donors with epilepsy if seizures have been well controlled for a period of time. But policies vary a lot by country and by individual center, and some plasma centers choose to defer anyone with a seizure history to minimize donor risk during apheresis.\n\nWhy some centers defer donors with epilepsy:\n- Donor safety during apheresis: Plasma donation can trigger vasovagal reactions (fainting) or citrate-related low calcium (tingling, muscle twitching, rarely spasms). These can feel similar to, or potentially provoke, a seizure in susceptible people. Centers may set stricter rules to avoid an on-site seizure with needles in both arms.\n- Policy variability: FDA/health authority rules set minimum standards, but centers can add their own exclusions. Some accept donors if seizure-free for a certain time (often around a year or more, sometimes requiring you to be off meds), while others defer all donors with epilepsy.\n- It’s not about recipient safety: Lamotrigine isn’t on typical medication deferral lists, and trace medication in source plasma that’s sent for fractionation isn’t the main concern.\n\nMedical considerations for you:\n- Controlled epilepsy with your last seizure in April 2021 is reassuring. There’s no strong evidence that occasional plasma donation meaningfully lowers lamotrigine levels; the larger risks are indirect (dehydration, sleep loss, low calcium, stress), which can lower seizure threshold.\n- If you do donate, reduce risk by: sleeping well the night before, eating beforehand, hydrating, and considering a calcium-containing snack or supplement (if safe for you) to reduce citrate symptoms. Keep your lamotrigine on schedule.\n- Avoid donating if you’ve had a recent seizure, any recent changes in seizure meds/doses, illness, fever, heavy alcohol use, or poor sleep.\n\nPractical next steps:\n- Call the specific center first and ask their policy for donors with epilepsy. Ask whether they accept donors who are seizure‑free for a defined period while on stable medication.\n- Some centers will accept a note from your neurologist or primary care clinician stating your epilepsy is well controlled and you’re fit to donate.\n- If one center defers you categorically, another may have a more permissive policy—blood donation centers often differ from commercial source‑plasma centers.\n- If you’ve never donated before, consider starting with infrequent donations and see how you feel over the next 24–48 hours.\n\nBottom line: There is a legitimate donor-safety reason some centers defer people with epilepsy during plasma apheresis, but many organizations do allow donation when seizures are well controlled. Your being seizure‑free since 2021 on stable lamotrigine would meet eligibility at some centers; call ahead and, if needed, get a brief clearance note from your clinician.",

    "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I’ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I’m seeing that I haven’t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I’m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I’d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it’s important to me to know when it’s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
    "answer": "Short answer: it still belongs in your medical history, but you can (and should) present it as resolved. The way you phrase it matters.\n\nWhy it’s still relevant\n- It can affect medication choices and dosing (some drugs lower seizure threshold).\n- Anesthesia/sedation teams want to know any seizure history.\n- Certain jobs/licenses (driving in some states, commercial driving, aviation, military, some safety‑sensitive roles) have specific rules.\n\nWhy it’s less relevant now\n- By International League Against Epilepsy criteria, epilepsy is considered “resolved” if you’ve been seizure‑free for 10 years and off anti‑seizure meds for at least 5. You meet that definition. Your recurrence risk is low, though never zero.\n\nHow to answer forms\n- If the question is “Do you currently have a seizure disorder/epilepsy?” → No. Add: “History of childhood temporal lobe epilepsy—resolved after right temporal/hippocampal surgery at age 10; seizure‑free since; no meds.”\n- If it says “Have you ever had seizures/epilepsy?” → Yes. Add the same clarifier above.\n- Keep a one‑liner you can paste: “Resolved childhood temporal lobe epilepsy s/p right anterior temporal lobectomy/partial hippocampectomy at age 10; seizure‑free since 20XX; off ASMs; no restrictions per neurology.”\n\nDriving/DMV\n- Most states care about seizures within the last 3–12 months. Many do not restrict drivers with long‑resolved epilepsy, but wording on forms varies (“ever” vs “current”). Check your state’s DMV rules.\n- Consider getting a brief letter from your PCP/neurologist stating “epilepsy resolved; seizure‑free since childhood; no driving restrictions.” Keep a copy for DMV or employers if needed.\n\nMedications/procedures to flag\n- Meds that can lower seizure threshold: bupropion (especially high dose/IR), tramadol, meperidine, clozapine, high‑dose TCAs, theophylline; fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin), high‑dose penicillins/carbapenems; heavy alcohol use/withdrawal; severe sleep deprivation.\n- Anesthesia/sedation: always disclose your past epilepsy and surgery. It rarely changes the plan but is good to know.\n\nWhen you usually don’t need to elaborate\n- Routine care, dental work with local anesthesia, standard vaccines, imaging, etc.—a brief “resolved epilepsy, no meds” note is sufficient.\n\nIf you ever have new spells (deja vu auras, loss of awareness, unexplained blackouts), see a clinician promptly.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a short note to ask your doctor for (or to paste into forms) tailored with your exact dates/meds.",

    "question": "27 years old male Non smoker 73 kg 180 cm No other chronic illnessFor the past decade, I've been dealing with two distinct issues.- The first involves zigzag flashes across my field of vision, which are then followed by a mild headache lasting about an hour.- The second is an abrupt sensation of déjà vu or dream recall that leaves me feeling anxious and uncertain about my own memories.Both of these \"auras\" typically last around 20 minutes. I haven't sought treatment yet since these episodes occur infrequently—sometimes just once a year or once every few months.I'm unsure if what I'm experiencing is related to epilepsy or migraines?If anyone has had similar experiences, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.",
    "answer": "Short answer: The zig‑zag visual spells followed by a mild 1‑hour headache are classic for migraine with visual aura. The déjà‑vu/dreamy/anxious spells could be either another type of migraine aura or (less likely, but worth checking) focal aware seizures from the temporal lobe. The main clue is duration: your 15–20 minute auras fit migraine better; focal seizures are usually sudden and last seconds to 2 minutes.\n\nHow to tell them apart\n- Migraine aura (likely your first description):\n  - Positive visual phenomena (shimmering, zig‑zags, fortification spectra) that gradually spread across vision.\n  - Builds over 5–20 minutes; total 5–60 minutes.\n  - Often followed by headache, light/sound sensitivity, nausea.\n- Temporal lobe focal seizures (possible for the déjà‑vu spells):\n  - Sudden onset; typically 10–120 seconds.\n  - Stereotyped déjà vu, rising “stomach” feeling, fear, odd smells/tastes, time distortion.\n  - May progress to impaired awareness, lip smacking/automatisms, then brief confusion.\n  - Headache can happen after, but not required.\n\nWhy I lean migraine for both:\n- Your auras last ~20 minutes, which is long for seizures but typical for migraine aura.\n- The visual description is classic for migraine.\n- If the déjà‑vu episodes also ramp up and fade over minutes and sometimes lead to a headache, that supports migraine aura without headache (acephalgic aura) or a nonvisual aura.\n\nThat said, déjà vu is a hallmark temporal‑lobe seizure symptom, so a one‑time neurology evaluation is reasonable.\n\nWhat to do next\n- See a neurologist (non‑urgent). Ask about:\n  - MRI brain (with epilepsy protocol) once in your life given the déjà‑vu spells.\n  - Routine or ambulatory EEG if seizure is a concern.\n- Keep a brief log of episodes:\n  - Exact start/stop times, how it starts (sudden vs gradual), spread, associated symptoms (nausea, light/sound sensitivity), awareness changes, triggers (sleep loss, stress, dehydration, alcohol), and whether a headache follows.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or worst-ever headache, aura lasting >60 minutes, new weakness/numbness/speech trouble, persistent confusion, a seizure with loss of awareness, head injury, fever/stiff neck, or a sudden marked change in pattern/frequency.\n\nTreatment options (if these stay infrequent)\n- Acute migraine:\n  - Take an NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen/naproxen) early. Triptans work best at headache onset; they’re usually not very effective for the aura itself.\n  - Rest, hydrate, dark/quiet room; consider an anti‑nausea med if needed.\n- Prevention/lifestyle:\n  - Regular sleep, meals, hydration, exercise, stress management; moderate caffeine; identify triggers.\n  - If auras increase, options include magnesium glycinate 300–400 mg daily, riboflavin 400 mg daily; prescription preventives if needed (e.g., beta‑blockers, topiramate). Lamotrigine can help aura‑predominant migraine in selected cases.\n- If epilepsy is diagnosed:\n  - Anti‑seizure meds (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine) are effective; follow local driving rules. Do not start any antiseizure drug without a diagnosis.\n\nBottom line: Your visual events are very likely migraine with aura. The déjà‑vu spells last longer than typical seizures and could be migraine aura too, but because déjà vu is a classic seizure symptom, get a non‑urgent neurology workup (MRI/EEG) for reassurance and to be thorough.",

    "question": "My partner (20M) has been having these ‘seizure-like’ behaviours for as long as he can remember (so assuming his whole life). There are 2 separate ‘actions’ which he isn’t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5”8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it’s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It’s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don’t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking ‘ in pain’) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he’s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don’t seem to have a particular ‘trigger’ so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he’s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these ‘spasms’ for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these ‘faces’. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he’s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he’s ‘making weird faces’.",
    "answer": "Thanks for the detailed description—that helps a lot.\n\nWhat you’re describing sounds much more like tics or motor stereotypies (“stimming”) than epileptic seizures:\n- Occur many times a day, often with excitement or intense focus\n- Preserved awareness, sometimes can be interrupted by calling his name\n- Facial grimacing, tensing, squeezing hands, whole‑body “vibrating”\n- Lifelong pattern\n\nSeizures are typically not interruptible, often have a fixed pattern, may cause loss of awareness, and are followed by confusion; what you’ve described doesn’t fit that well.\n\nMost likely possibilities\n- Motor tics/Tourette spectrum: brief, repetitive movements (facial grimace, eye squeeze, tensing). People often have an internal “urge” that’s relieved by doing the movement, and symptoms wax and wane with stress/excitement. Many also have subtle vocal tics (sniffing, throat‑clearing).\n- Motor stereotypies/stimming: rhythmic/repetitive movements linked to excitement, focus, or stress; common in neurodivergent people (ADHD/ASD) but can occur in anyone. Often done without awareness and not dangerous.\n\nOther, less likely possibilities include paroxysmal dyskinesias or rare reflex epilepsies, but your description doesn’t strongly suggest these.\n\nWhat would help next\n- Please describe the “second action” you mentioned (what it looks like, duration, awareness, triggers, whether he can stop it).\n- Answer a few screening questions:\n  - Can he ever hold the movements back briefly? Is there an internal “urge” beforehand?\n  - Any vocal tics (sniffing, throat clearing, humming)?\n  - Do events happen in sleep?\n  - Any loss of awareness, falls, tongue‑biting (especially side of tongue), urinary incontinence, or prolonged confusion?\n  - Any ADHD/ASD traits (sensory sensitivities, social/communication differences, strong routines/interests), OCD, or anxiety?\n  - Family history of tics, Tourette’s, or movement disorders?\n\nPractical steps\n- Try to get clear videos of several typical episodes (with his consent) in different contexts and bring them to an appointment.\n- Start with primary care for referral to a neurologist—ideally one who sees movement disorders/tics. If neurodivergence is suspected, a neurodevelopmental evaluation may also help.\n- Don’t shame or forcibly interrupt the movements; that can increase distress and frequency. Agree together on when he wants a gentle cue (if at all).\n- If symptoms are bothersome or socially impairing, ask about:\n  - Behavioral therapy for tics (CBIT/habit reversal training)—often very effective.\n  - For stereotypies, occupational therapy strategies and planned “stim time” can help.\n  - Medications are available if needed, but many people don’t require them.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Any episode with loss of consciousness, blue/pale color, injury, or convulsive shaking lasting more than 5 minutes or repeated back‑to‑back without recovery.\n\nIf you can share more details about the second type of episode and the answers to the questions above, I can help narrow the possibilities and suggest more targeted next steps.",

    "question": "I have tc seizures about twice a month or so. I have recently run out of my generic keppra 3 days ago. I will not be able to get a new script for keppra until Monday. I do have my rescue medication (generic Ativan) which I have never had to take before. should I take this every 12 hours like I do my keppra?",
    "answer": "Short answer: No—don’t start taking your lorazepam (Ativan) on a fixed schedule every 12 hours unless a clinician specifically tells you to. Lorazepam is your rescue medication and should be used only as directed in your seizure action plan (for a prolonged seizure or a cluster), not as a replacement for your daily levetiracetam.\n\nYou’ve been off levetiracetam (Keppra) for 3 days, which does raise your seizure risk. Please try to get a short-term supply today rather than waiting until Monday.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Call your pharmacy immediately:\n  - Ask for an emergency/temporary supply of levetiracetam to last until Monday. In many places pharmacists can provide a short “bridge” for non‑controlled meds or contact your prescriber for an urgent refill.\n  - If your pharmacy can’t help, ask them to transfer your prescription to another pharmacy that has it in stock.\n- Call your prescriber’s office (ask for the on‑call provider) or your primary care clinic and request an urgent short-term refill.\n- If those fail, go to urgent care, a walk‑in clinic, or the emergency department today for a short refill. Levetiracetam is commonly stocked and inexpensive with discount coupons.\n\nSafety until you’re back on levetiracetam\n- Do not drive, swim alone, climb heights, bathe in a tub, or operate dangerous equipment.\n- Get good sleep, avoid alcohol or recreational drugs, manage stress, and have someone stay with you if possible.\n- Keep your rescue lorazepam accessible and follow the instructions you were given (typically for a seizure lasting >5 minutes or repeated seizures without full recovery). If you have to use it, call emergency services per your action plan.\n- If a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, you have repeated seizures without returning to baseline, you’re injured, pregnant, or feel very unwell—use rescue med as directed and call 911/EMS.\n\nOnce you have levetiracetam, resume your usual dosing schedule. If you’re unsure how to restart after several missed days, ask your clinician or pharmacist.\n\nIf you tell me your location (country/state) I can suggest the quickest local options for an emergency supply.

    "question": "25MI don't get it. I'm awake and alert in the middle of the day. and everything's fine. I wake up early and my brain says, \"screw you, here's a seizure. Have fun.\"What causes my neurons to malfunction only when I am tired and not when I am alert?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. You’re not imagining it—many people with epilepsy are most vulnerable when sleep-deprived and around sleep–wake transitions, especially on awakening.\n\nWhy tiredness and mornings lower the seizure threshold\n- Sleep loss increases cortical excitability and synchrony. Neurons fire more in lockstep, which makes it easier for a seizure to start and spread.\n- NREM sleep and the transition into/out of sleep favor synchronized brain rhythms; REM (dream sleep) is more desynchronized and tends to suppress seizures. The “flip” between states (falling asleep, waking) is an unstable moment for the network.\n- Circadian changes on waking—rising cortisol, shifts in melatonin/adenosine/orexin, body temperature, CO2—modulate ion channels and neurotransmitters that govern excitability.\n- Common extras stack the deck in the morning: missed or late meds, dehydration, low blood sugar, a late night or alcohol, bright flicker (sunlight through trees, screens).\n\nThis pattern is classic in several epilepsy syndromes (for example, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often has myoclonic jerks or seizures shortly after waking, and after sleep deprivation).\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Prioritize sleep: same bedtime/wake time daily; aim 7–9 hours; avoid all‑nighters and big sleep swings.\n- Alcohol: avoid binges; ideally none the night before important mornings.\n- Caffeine: moderate and earlier in the day; don’t use it to “paper over” sleep loss.\n- Screens/flash: enable anti-flicker settings, avoid rapid flicker, use sunglasses with morning glare if you’re photosensitive.\n- Hydration and breakfast soon after waking.\n- Meds: take exactly as prescribed; ask your neurologist if shifting dose timing (e.g., more coverage overnight/early morning or extended‑release) could help.\n- Check for sleep apnea if you snore, gasp, or are unusually sleepy—treating it can markedly reduce seizures.\n- Keep a seizure diary (sleep hours, alcohol, stress, illness, meds, time of day) to show patterns.\n- Safety in the morning: shower with door unlocked, avoid heights, don’t swim alone, and follow local driving rules until you’re controlled.\n\nWhen to seek care\n- If these are new or changing seizures, or you’ve never seen a neurologist: you need an evaluation (history, exam, MRI, and an EEG—often a sleep‑deprived EEG is most revealing).\n- Urgent help if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, head injury, trouble breathing, or new weakness/confusion.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- What type of seizures you have (jerks, staring, convulsions), how long they last, and how often.\n- Whether they cluster right after waking, and if sleep loss or alcohol reliably triggers them.\n- Your current meds and timing.\n- Any snoring or witnessed pauses in breathing at night.\n\nThat can help tailor more specific suggestions for you.",

    "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven’t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I’ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I’m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out. I was also having some breakthrough seizures in my sleep.Current meds: escitalopram 15mg q24 (recent increase) lacosamide 200mg q12 gabapentin 400mg q8-12 buspirone 5mg q12 (new) tizanidine 2-4mg before bed celecoxib 100mg q12-24 Vyvanse 30mg as needed (which I did quit for a while to see if it was the culprit. No change)Failed meds: temazepam venlafaxine lorazepam apriprazoleI just want my life back. I’m under the care of a new mental health facility because I felt like the last one wasn’t taking me seriously. Going to work or school is nearly impossible and I cry several times per day along with multiple panic attacks. We’ve considered an IOP or inpatient hospitalization if this isn’t under control soon.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry this happened to you. What you describe sounds frightening, invalidating, and traumatic—and none of it is your fault. Given your history and the event you went through, it’s understandable that you’re now dealing with severe anxiety, sleep disruption, mood changes, and breakthrough nocturnal seizures.\n\nWhat might be going on\n- Post-seizure effects and brain “afterburn”: A prolonged cluster can leave weeks to months of worsened cognition, mood lability, irritability, and sleep disruption. In frontal lobe epilepsy, mood/behavior changes can also be seizure-related.\n- PTSD/medical trauma layered onto preexisting CPTSD, with hyperarousal and 3 a.m. awakenings.\n- Possible nocturnal seizures or arousals around 3–3:30 a.m. (common timing for some seizure patterns).\n- Medication effects/interactions and subtherapeutic dosing for anxiety (e.g., buspirone dose still low; recent SSRI increase can be activating at first).\n- Sleep disorders (insomnia, possible sleep apnea), pain, and stress—each can aggravate seizures and anxiety.\n\nHigh‑priority next steps\n1) See an epilepsy specialist (epileptologist) promptly\n- Ask for admission to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) or at minimum a multi‑night ambulatory EEG to capture the 3 a.m. awakenings and any sleep seizures.\n- If not done after last summer: MRI brain with epilepsy protocol to look for interval injury from the seizure cluster.\n- Review your current anti-seizure plan. Lacosamide is reasonable, but persistent nocturnal events may need regimen adjustment or add‑on therapy. Discuss options that tend to be easier on mood (e.g., lamotrigine add‑on; brivaracetam if a levetiracetam‑like option is considered), and non‑drug options (VNS) if seizures remain refractory.\n\n2) Create or update a written seizure action plan\n- Ensure you have a fast‑acting rescue med at home and work (e.g., nasal midazolam or diazepam, or oral/SL lorazepam if that’s what your neuro recommends) with clear instructions for you and your partner.\n- When to call 911: seizure >5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, injury, trouble breathing, or if it’s different from your usual.\n- Consider a nighttime seizure alert (Embrace watch, SAMi camera, etc.) and don’t sleep alone until seizures are under better control. Nocturnal seizures carry added risk, and detection can be protective.\n\n3) Make your anesthesia precautions impossible to miss\n- List “Propofol—severe adverse reaction with seizure cluster” as an allergy/intolerance in every chart.\n- Ask your neurologist to write a one‑page “Peri‑procedural plan” stating: premedication, agents to avoid, and what to give if a seizure occurs (e.g., lorazepam), with contact info. Carry it, upload to portals, and wear a medical ID.\n\n4) Medication review with your prescribers\n- Escitalopram: recent increases can temporarily worsen anxiety; if it ultimately helps, 20 mg is a usual max. Monitor for activation, tremor, sweats, worsening panic—especially combined with buspirone.\n- Buspirone: 5 mg twice daily is a starting dose; typical effective dose is 10–15 mg twice daily (sometimes three times daily). It often needs 2–4+ weeks at a therapeutic dose to help.\n- Gabapentin: can help anxiety and sleep but can also cause brain fog and moodiness in some. If anxiety/sleep remain poor, ask about switching to pregabalin (often more effective for anxiety and sleep) or streamlining nighttime meds so they don’t worsen next‑day anxiety.\n- Tizanidine: helpful for spasms but can fragment sleep and drop blood pressure. If prazosin (for PTSD‑related nightmares) is considered, you’d need close BP monitoring and may not be able to combine both safely.\n- Panic options that are seizure‑safer than benzodiazepines for regular use: consider propranolol PRN for somatic symptoms; hydroxyzine can help but at higher doses may lower seizure threshold—use cautiously and discuss first.\n- Interactions to keep in mind: escitalopram + buspirone can rarely cause serotonin syndrome (watch for agitation, sweating, tremor, diarrhea); celecoxib + SSRI slightly increases bleeding risk; lacosamide can slow heart conduction—an EKG is reasonable if you develop palpitations or dizziness.\n\n5) Sleep and circadian reset\n- Ask for CBT‑I (insomnia therapy) and consider a short‑term, structured plan:\n  - Fixed wake‑time daily; avoid naps.\n  - If you wake at 3 a.m. and can’t sleep after 15–20 minutes, use low light, quiet non-screen activity until drowsy; avoid phone brightness.\n  - Two hours before bed: dim lights, no caffeine, no heavy meals, gentle wind‑down.\n  - Melatonin 0.5–1 mg 4–5 hours before target bedtime (for circadian timing) and/or 1–3 mg near bedtime for sleep onset—discuss with your doctor given your meds.\n- Screen for sleep apnea (especially if snoring, witnessed apneas, morning headaches) since it can worsen seizures and mood.\n\n6) Trauma‑focused care\n- Your reaction is consistent with medical trauma on top of CPTSD. Targeted therapies (EMDR, CPT, or trauma‑focused CBT) can help with hyperarousal and panic.\n- Prazosin can reduce trauma‑related nightmares and early‑morning awakenings; discuss BP and interaction considerations with tizanidine.\n- If functioning is collapsing, an IOP focused on trauma/anxiety is reasonable. If there’s any suicidal thinking or inability to care for yourself, inpatient stabilization is appropriate.\n\n7) Document and assess changes\n- Neuropsychological testing can document cognitive/behavioral changes since the event, guide rehab (speech/cognitive therapy), and support workplace/school accommodations (ADA/FMLA).\n- Basic labs that can worsen anxiety/sleep if abnormal: TSH, CBC, ferritin/iron, B12, vitamin D, CMP; consider hormones if symptoms cycle with menses (catamenial epilepsy).\n\n8) Day‑to‑day coping while you wait for appointments\n- Keep a diary of sleep times, awakenings, panic episodes, and any suspected seizures (and relation to your cycle).\n- Gentle, regular movement; sunlight within an hour of waking; consistent meals and hydration; reduce alcohol/cannabis if used (both can worsen sleep and seizures).\n- Agree with your partner on a nighttime plan so awakenings feel safer and less chaotic.\n\nSafety\n- If you have thoughts of harming yourself or feel you can’t stay safe, seek urgent care or call your local emergency number. In the U.S., call/text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; use 911 for medical emergencies or continuous seizures.\n- For any seizure emergency as above, call 911.\n\nA few questions that would help tailor this:\n- Have you had an MRI and any EEG since the event? If so, what did they show?\n- Do your 3 a.m. awakenings coincide with your menstrual cycle or with pain flares?\n- Do you currently have a rescue seizure medication at home?\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a one‑page “Care Summary” you can carry to appointments and procedures.",

    "question": "I have 2 conditions(?) i want to mention, the second being (in my opinion) more severe than the first.the first is something ive noticed more recently. im not sure how long its been going on. i got an apple watch in december, which is the first heart rate tracking device ive owned. ive been using it to occasionally measure my heartrate, and ive noticed that my resting heart rate lies anywhere from 20-50 or 60 bpm lower than my standing heart rate. for a while, immediately upon standing i would become dizzy and my vision would fade a little, and i would see spots. this usually clears up after around 10 seconds 20 seconds at the most. ive seen a lot of resources about pots but i dont and have never fainted or started sweating due to standing the second is something i can give a lot more details on. ive been calling these \"blackouts\" but thats not medically accurate. it usually starts with me feeling unusually sick for a bit, then suddenly, the sickness symptoms will instantly disappear and my hearing will muffle greatly, and my ears will start ringing, but the ringing is also muffled. then, my field of vision will begin to tunnel, gradually getting smaller and smaller, until it becomes completely black, at which point i lose all recollection of what im doing, im basically acting without being conscious.these started when i was 8 and have happened every few years or so since, with them gradually getting worse and worse. the first time it happened, it was just slight lightheadedness and nausea, then muffled hearing and my vision partially tunneling, but not going all the way. this more recent time a little less than 2 years ago, however, i felt extremely nauseous, i felt extremely cold yet i was sweating profusely, i think i might have had a headache too i cant fully remember. i felt like i was gonna die before the \"blackout\" even started and the muffled hearing started. when i fully blacked out and lost consciousness (while still controlling my body, like a zombie in a sense), i have no idea how long i was out for, and i only was brought back to reality when i felt water hit my foot after i knocked over a pitcher.ive done a lot of research on this specifically and the closest thing ive found has been transient ischemic attacks. im not fully sure if this is a tia though, especially because i cant recall weakness in one side of my body at any time during one of these, but that might be because my memory during these events isnt really the best. additionally, my moms biological mom had several strokes before dying of another stroke, which could make me more predisposed to strokes, but again im not entirely sure. ive also gotten results for certain types of epilepsy, but i never looked too deep into them so that may not be validthe reason i bring these two afflictions up together is because maybe im missing something? maybe these are both signs of a rare illness or something? maybe theyre two different things that are co morbid? they may have nothing to do with each other at all though, i just want to include anything i can think of some other things i have are a heat sensitivity (not sure if this is the correct term, but basically i just get really really hot for no reason and cant cool off until i put cold water on my body), as well as sweating a lot, like ill be cold and still sweating. not sure if these have anything to do with the above but im adding it here just in case.if you have any questions feel free to ask, theres something i may have forgotten to add here. also im sorry about the length, i have a tendency to explain things with a lot more words than are needed",
    "answer": "Thank you for laying this out so clearly — it really helps.\n\nWhat you’re describing sounds most consistent with orthostatic intolerance (possibly POTS/vasovagal tendency) plus intermittent “blackout” episodes that, from your description, sound more like vasovagal syncope/near-syncope than TIA. TIAs typically cause sudden, focal neurologic deficits (trouble speaking, one-sided weakness, loss of vision in one eye) without the classic prodrome of nausea, sweating, ringing ears, and tunnel vision. Your prodrome and triggers (standing, heat, feeling unwell) and the course (muffled hearing, tunnel vision, then “blanked out” with poor memory of the event) are classic for neurally mediated syncope. Epilepsy is still on the differential, but several features favor syncope.\n\nThat said, unexplained blackouts deserve a medical evaluation. Below are the key points, what to do now, and what to ask your clinician.\n\nWhat your symptoms suggest\n- Orthostatic intolerance/POTS spectrum: An increase in heart rate of 30–60 bpm from lying to standing with lightheadedness, tunnel vision, and improvement after 10–20 seconds is consistent. Apple Watch data are helpful, but a formal orthostatic assessment is better.\n- Vasovagal syncope/near-syncope: Nausea, feeling cold/hot, sweating, muffled hearing, tunnel vision, and brief loss of awareness are typical. People can have amnesia for behavior during these episodes; brief, semi-purposeful movements can occur without full awareness.\n- Less likely from your description: TIA/stroke. Still seek urgent care if any one-sided weakness, new speech or vision loss, or persistent neurologic symptoms occur.\n- Also consider contributions from dehydration, anemia/low iron, thyroid issues, medications, stimulant use, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction (your heat intolerance and sweating fit with dysautonomia).\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now\nGo to urgent care/ER or call emergency services if any of the following occur:\n- Blackout or near-faint during exertion or while lying down\n- Chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath with an episode\n- Injury from a fall, prolonged confusion (>10–15 minutes), or repeated episodes clustering\n- New focal neurologic symptoms (weakness/numbness on one side, trouble speaking, new vision loss)\n- Family history of sudden cardiac death or known serious heart rhythm problem\n\nWhat you can do at home now\n- Hydration and salt: Aim for about 2–3 liters of fluids daily and liberal salt (unless you have high blood pressure, heart, or kidney disease). Many with POTS feel better with 3–10 g/day of salt—ask your clinician what’s appropriate for you.\n- Slow position changes: Rise slowly from lying to sitting to standing; sit or lie down at the first sign of symptoms.\n- Counter-pressure maneuvers: When you feel presyncope, cross your legs and tense your calves/thighs, squeeze a ball or your fists, or do buttock squeezes to raise blood pressure.\n- Compression: Waist-high 20–30 mmHg compression stockings or abdominal binder can help.\n- Avoid triggers: Heat, hot showers, prolonged standing, large meals, alcohol. Try small, frequent meals.\n- Exercise: Gradual, recumbent exercise (rowing, cycling, swimming) progressing to upright training can improve symptoms over weeks to months.\n- Apple Watch: Keep high/irregular heart rate alerts on. If you have an episode, try to capture an ECG (if your model supports it) and note time/symptoms.\n\nA simple home orthostatic check (with a helper if possible)\n- Rest lying down quietly for 10 minutes; record HR and BP.\n- Stand up; record HR/BP at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes, staying still but supported if needed.\n- Concerning patterns:\n  - POTS pattern: HR rise ≥30 bpm in adults (≥40 bpm if 12–19 years) within 10 minutes standing, without a BP drop of ≥20/10 mmHg, plus symptoms.\n  - Orthostatic hypotension: BP drop ≥20 systolic or ≥10 diastolic within 3 minutes of standing.\n\nWhat to discuss with your clinician\n- A detailed episode history: triggers (standing, heat, illness, stress, pain, bathroom), warning symptoms, duration, injuries, recovery time, witness accounts (pallor, jerks, snoring, cyanosis), and whether episodes ever happen during exercise or while lying down.\n- Medications/supplements, caffeine/energy drinks, alcohol, hydration, and sleep.\n- Menstrual pattern, pregnancy possibility, weight/nutrition.\n- Past medical history (anemia, thyroid, diabetes), family history of arrhythmia or sudden death before age 50, and your family’s stroke history.\n- Photos or logs from your watch; your home orthostatic readings.\n\nTests your clinician may consider\n- Vitals with orthostatic measurements; physical exam including heart/neurologic.\n- ECG; possibly ambulatory rhythm monitoring (Holter/Zio) to look for arrhythmias during symptoms.\n- Blood tests: CBC (anemia), ferritin/iron, electrolytes, glucose, thyroid panel, B12/folate; others as indicated.\n- Echocardiogram if structural heart disease is suspected.\n- Tilt-table test if POTS/vasovagal syncope is suspected but unclear.\n- Neurology evaluation/EEG only if features suggest seizures (see below).\n\nSeizure vs syncope clues\n- Favors syncope: Clear triggers (standing/heat), prodrome with nausea/sweating/tunnel vision, brief loss of awareness, quick recovery, little confusion.\n- Favors seizure: No prodrome or a stereotyped aura (déjà vu, rising stomach), head/eye deviation, prolonged unresponsiveness, tongue biting on the side, urinary incontinence, significant confusion >10–15 minutes after, events during rest/sleep, or recurrent stereotyped episodes without positional/trigger pattern.\n\nA few questions for you (answering these can help narrow things):\n- How old are you now, and how old were you at the last event?\n- Do episodes ever happen during exercise or while you’re lying down?\n- Any chest pain, racing/irregular heartbeats, or shortness of breath with episodes?\n- Has anyone witnessed an event? Did you look pale? Did you fully collapse or just “zone out” standing?\n- Any tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or long confusion afterward?\n- Current medications/supplements, caffeine/stimulant use?\n- Any history of anemia/low iron, thyroid disease, or significant weight loss?\n- Apple Watch: what HR have you seen when lying vs standing during symptoms?\n\nBottom line\n- Your story fits orthostatic intolerance (possibly POTS) and vasovagal syncope much more than TIA. It still deserves a proper workup to rule out heart rhythm issues and to guide treatment.\n- Make an appointment with your primary care clinician (or cardiology if available). Bring your symptom log and any watch data.\n- Use the safety steps above, and seek urgent care if red-flag features occur.\n\nIf you’d like, share the answers to the questions above and any watch readings, and I can help you prepare a concise note to take to your visit.",

    "question": "18M 72kg/160lbs 180cm healthy non-smoker and non-drinker. My blood pressure normally around 55/110 and my mother has epilepsy. I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
    "answer": "Short answer: What you describe sounds more like a faint (vasovagal/orthostatic syncope) with brief “convulsive” movements than an epileptic seizure, but you should still be checked, especially because you lost consciousness and are still feeling foggy.\n\nWhy syncope fits better\n- Clear trigger: hyperventilation plus standing up can suddenly drop brain blood flow and cause a faint.\n- Brief loss of consciousness with quick return and partial recall of scraping the carpet.\n- Short, brief movements (10 seconds) can happen in fainting (called convulsive syncope) and can be asymmetric.\n- Epileptic seizures are more likely when there’s no clear trigger, longer rhythmic jerking (1–2 minutes), lateral tongue biting, urinary incontinence, and prolonged confusion (often 30+ minutes).\n\nWhat to do now\n- Go to urgent care/ER now if any of these are present: you hit your head hard, severe or worsening headache, repeated vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, new weakness/numbness, confusion that’s not steadily improving, or another episode.\n- If you’re otherwise okay, arrange a prompt visit with your primary care clinician in the next 24–72 hours. Bring the friend who witnessed it if possible.\n\nWhat evaluation usually includes\n- Orthostatic vitals (lying/sitting/standing blood pressure and pulse)\n- ECG to check heart rhythm\n- Basic labs (glucose, electrolytes)\n- If there’s lingering doubt for seizure or if events recur: neurology referral, EEG, and often a brain MRI.\n\nSafety until you’re evaluated\n- Don’t drive, swim alone, climb heights, or operate machinery.\n- Hydrate well, don’t skip meals, rise slowly from sitting/lying.\n- If you feel a faint coming on: lie down with legs elevated, or sit and perform counter-pressure maneuvers (leg crossing, tensing thighs/buttocks, handgrip) and slow nasal/belly breathing.\n\nA few clarifying questions (answer if you can):\n- Did you bite your tongue (especially the side) or lose urine?\n- How long were you unresponsive?\n- Did you strike your head?\n- Any chest pain, racing heartbeat, or shortness of breath before the event?\n- Any similar episodes in the past?\n\nFamily history of epilepsy does raise your baseline risk slightly, but a single, clearly triggered faint with brief movements is much more commonly syncope than epilepsy. Getting checked will help confirm and keep you safe.",

    "question": "Female, 47, 65kg, 1.62cm, no other medicine or illness until thus far. No smoke, drinking, children or cases in the family.Up until I was 7 I took Gardenal. Then stopped - and my late granduncle was the top pediatric neurologist in the country - and did EEGs yearly until about 25.Had deja-vus up until college, never thought they could be considered related to epilepsy.When I was 45, epidemic, worst job in the world. Colleagues were in Rio, London, Lagos and Dubai. My sleep pattern went haywire, and I turned to Zolpidem to give me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Started at 5mg. As pressure grew, isolation, trouble in the job, slowly I grew the dosage. Had a burnout, left the job, and now I was taking 500mg to 600mg a day. Yes, 2 to 3 boxes. A day. I was floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid.Then I started having tonic-clonics. 8 in few months. I was deeply scared and built a team of therapist, psychologist and neurologist. Good news, nothing physical in the brain. Other good news is that I quit Zolpidem cold turkey, had withdrawal, suffered a lot... But quit.",
    "answer": "First, congratulations on stopping zolpidem—that was extremely hard and took real courage. What you describe (massive doses, sleep deprivation, then clusters of tonic‑clonic seizures) fits with sedative‑hypnotic–related seizures, and sleep loss is a strong trigger. Given your childhood history of antiseizure medication and long‑standing déjà‑vu episodes, you may also have an underlying seizure tendency that was unmasked by stress, sleep loss, and zolpidem.\n\nWhat would help me guide you better\n- When was your last seizure, and have you had any since stopping zolpidem?\n- Are you on any antiseizure medication now? If yes, which and what dose?\n- How would you describe the “déjà‑vu” events now: duration, any rising stomach sensation, fear, odd smells/tastes, lip smacking, loss of awareness, or confusion afterward?\n- What did your recent tests show? (EEG report details; MRI with epilepsy protocol?)\n- Any current sleep plan or medications for sleep/anxiety/depression?\n\nWhat I recommend discussing with your neurologist\n- Whether your seizures were “provoked” (from zolpidem withdrawal + sleep loss) versus an underlying epilepsy (temporal lobe is possible given the stereotyped déjà‑vu). This affects treatment duration and driving rules.\n- If you’re still having any spells (even brief déjà‑vu), consider starting or continuing an antiseizure medication. Options often considered: lamotrigine or lacosamide (tend to be mood‑friendlier); levetiracetam works but can worsen irritability in some. Choice depends on EEG/MRI, side‑effect profile, and your mood history.\n- A repeat or prolonged EEG (ambulatory or video) and MRI epilepsy protocol if not already done.\n- A written seizure action plan and a rescue med (e.g., intranasal midazolam or diazepam) for clusters or a seizure >5 minutes.\n\nSafety and legal basics\n- Until your neurologist confirms you’re safe to drive, don’t drive. Many places require 6–12 months seizure‑free; check local rules.\n- Use showers instead of baths, don’t swim alone, avoid heights, open flames, or operating heavy machinery. Consider a medical ID.\n- Ask those around you to learn seizure first aid: time the seizure, protect head, don’t put anything in the mouth, roll to side, call emergency if >5 minutes or repeated without recovery.\n\nSleep and relapse prevention (critical for seizure control)\n- Keep a strict sleep schedule; aim for 7–9 hours.\n- CBT‑I is first‑line for insomnia; ask for a referral. Avoid sedatives “as needed.”\n- Cautious sleep aids: melatonin 1–3 mg 30–60 minutes before bed can help. Avoid alcohol, diphenhydramine/doxylamine, and cannabis—they can worsen seizures or sleep architecture.\n- Morning light exposure, regular exercise (not sleep‑disrupting late workouts), no screens 60 minutes before bed, cool/dark/quiet room.\n\nMedications and substances to avoid or use carefully\n- Absolutely avoid any return to zolpidem or other Z‑drugs/benzodiazepines.\n- Avoid bupropion and tramadol; both lower seizure threshold. Limit alcohol; don’t binge.\n- If pain meds needed, avoid meperidine and tramadol; discuss safer options.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated back‑to‑back, head injury, pregnancy, or prolonged confusion (>1 hour).\n- New neurological deficits (weakness, speech trouble), fever/stiff neck, severe headache unlike prior.\n\nTracking\n- Keep a seizure diary (dates, triggers, sleep, illnesses, menstrual cycle/perimenopausal symptoms, stress, meds). Video of events (if safe) can help your neurologist.\n\nIf you can share the timing of your last seizure, whether you’ve had any spells since quitting zolpidem, and what your EEG/MRI showed, I can help think through whether this looks more like withdrawal‑provoked events versus a focal epilepsy and what next steps make sense.",

    "question": "I (30F) had a seizure for the first time 3 days ago. I had had a couple beers, smoked a joint, and did some shrooms (none of which is unusual for me). I have no family history of epilepsy, and am in generally good health.I was checked out by paramedics immediately after the seizure who said I looked fine and it was probably from the shrooms. I went to my PCP the next day and she ordered a couple blood tests which all came back normal. I am waiting for brain imaging to be approved by my insurance.Now it’s three days later and I still feel exhausted and weak and slow. I could barely get through my workday today. Is this normal? Is extreme fatigue indicative of something?Also I don’t know if it’s relevant at all but about a month ago I started experiencing extreme nausea to the point I was calling off sick at work, vomiting in the middle of the day, and had just had a doctors appointment to discuss that the week before.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you went through that—first seizures are scary and it’s normal to feel unsure afterward.\n\nWhat you’re feeling now\n- Fatigue, brain fog, muscle soreness, and feeling “slow” for days after a generalized seizure (the postictal period) are common. Many people feel off for 24–72 hours, and sometimes up to a week.\n- That said, symptoms should gradually improve. If they’re getting worse or not improving at all, get re-checked.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now\n- Severe or worsening headache, fever/neck stiffness, confusion that isn’t improving, repeated vomiting, fainting, chest pain, new weakness/numbness on one side, trouble speaking, or vision changes.\n- Another seizure, especially one lasting >5 minutes, or back-to-back seizures without full recovery.\n- Dark cola-colored urine, severe muscle pain, or very little urination (possible muscle breakdown after a seizure).\n- Head injury during the seizure, or if you are pregnant.\n\nAbout the seizure and substances\n- Alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin can lower seizure threshold; combining them raises risk. Even if you’ve used them before, a one-time provoked seizure can happen.\n- Until you’re fully evaluated, avoid alcohol, cannabis, psychedelics, stimulants, and stay well rested and hydrated.\n\nThe month of nausea\n- Could be unrelated (GI illness, pregnancy, medication side effects, migraines, cannabinoid hyperemesis) but, paired with a first seizure, it makes it more important not to delay brain imaging.\n- Call your PCP to let them know about the persistent fatigue and the prior month of severe nausea; ask to expedite MRI brain (ideally with and without contrast) and to arrange an EEG in the next 1–2 weeks.\n\nWhat to review/test\n- If not already done, ask about: electrolytes (sodium, calcium, magnesium), glucose, kidney/liver function, complete blood count, pregnancy test (if applicable), creatine kinase (for muscle breakdown), and an ECG.\n- Review your meds/supplements for seizure-threshold–lowering agents (e.g., bupropion, tramadol, stimulants, some antibiotics, theophylline).\n\nSafety until cleared\n- Do not drive until a clinician clears you (laws vary; often a seizure-free period is required).\n- Showers instead of baths; don’t swim alone; avoid heights, ladders, heavy machinery, or open flames.\n- Let someone close know what to do: if a convulsive seizure happens, time it, protect the head, roll onto side, don’t put anything in the mouth, call EMS if >5 minutes or repeated seizures.\n\nSelf-care now\n- Prioritize sleep, hydration, and regular meals. Light activity is okay if you’re improving; avoid intense exercise for a few days.\n- If work is hard to get through, ask your PCP for a short rest note.\n\nBottom line\n- Feeling wiped out three days later can be normal after a first seizure, but because you also had a month of severe nausea, it’s worth pushing to expedite MRI and EEG and letting your doctor know your symptoms today. If any red flags above appear, seek urgent care immediately.",

    "question": "33f/5’3”/185lbs/no major health issuesWhat I’ve been experiencing: Out of nowhere my eyes get super sensitive to light. I will get an overwhelming sensation of doom/panic. My body basically forgets how to breathe. Heart rate goes up. My brain feels weird, dizzy, and fuzzy. I get hot and nauseous. I just don’t feel ok, something in my head just feels very off and I’m scared. These episodes last for a few seconds to a few minutes. I don’t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it’s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It’s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn’t the same feeling. I’ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn’t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area. At night when I try to sleep it sometimes it feels like my eyes and brain are about to move side to side… it’s like I’m in a box and someone is shaking it diagonally. Makes me dizzy as all hell and my body feels it too. That has happened a handful of times in my life in the past and I went years without it happening and it’s back, and it’s scary and feels horrible. Shaking my head hard helps stop it when I feel it coming on.Does what I’m experiencing sound like focal seizure/epilepsy? I’m really nervous about this. I’m wondering if it’s all because of the trazodone or if I had this since I was a kid (since I’ve experienced that weird shaking in a box sensation multiple times through my life) and the trazodone made it all come to the surface?Meds I take: klonopin 1mg, vitamin d, probiotic, melatonin 2mg, trazodone 25mg.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—what you describe is understandably scary. I can’t diagnose you here, but your symptoms warrant an in‑person evaluation soon.\n\nWhat your symptoms could be:\n- Focal (partial) seizures: Brief, stereotyped spells with fear/doom, autonomic surge (fast heart rate, nausea), altered breathing, “off” feeling, sometimes post‑episode fatigue can fit. Awareness can be preserved. Nighttime events around sleep onset can also be a seizure time. This is possible.\n- Vestibular migraine or BPPV (inner‑ear positional vertigo): Vertigo lasting seconds to minutes, worse when lying down/turning in bed, with light sensitivity, nausea, tinnitus, and headaches fits well. The “box shaking diagonally” and improvement with head movement are classic for positional vertigo; photophobia and headache suggest vestibular migraine.\n- Medication effects: Trazodone can cause dizziness, light sensitivity, headache, nausea; rarely seizures. Clonazepam can cause dizziness/imbalance and memory issues; missed doses/withdrawal can provoke symptoms. The combo can amplify lightheadedness.\n- Dysautonomia/POTS, arrhythmia, or panic physiology: Tachycardia, breath irregularity, heat, nausea can occur, though photophobia and positional vertigo point more to vestibular causes.\n- Eye issues: New/worsening floaters or photophobia can be ocular; significant new floaters, flashes, or a curtain over vision need urgent eye exam.\n\nDoes this sound like focal seizures?\n- Some features fit (sudden onset, fear/doom, autonomic symptoms, brief duration, post‑event fatigue, long history of similar brief spells).\n- Other features strongly fit vestibular causes (positional vertigo in bed, photophobia, tinnitus, headache).\n- It may be one condition or both. You need evaluation to sort this out.\n\nWhat to do next (soon, within days to 1–2 weeks):\n- Neurology appointment:\n  - EEG (consider ambulatory EEG if events are frequent), and brain MRI with and without contrast.\n- Primary care:\n  - Orthostatic vitals, ECG; consider Holter monitor if palpitations are prominent.\n  - Labs: CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, ferritin/iron, magnesium, vitamin D.\n- Eye care (optometrist/ophthalmologist):\n  - Because of increased floaters/visual changes. Go urgently (same day) if you have flashes of light or a “curtain/shadow” in vision.\n- Consider ENT/neuro-otology if vertigo is prominent:\n  - Vestibular testing (VNG/VHIT) and guidance on BPPV maneuvers or vestibular migraine treatment.\n\nMedication notes:\n- Trazodone at 25 mg rarely lowers seizure threshold but can cause dizziness/visual sensitivity. Do not stop suddenly; discuss with your prescriber.\n- Clonazepam is anticonvulsant but can impair balance and memory; missed doses can trigger withdrawal symptoms. Take exactly as prescribed and do not self‑adjust.\n- Bring all meds and timing to your visit. Note any recent changes, missed doses, alcohol, or sleep deprivation.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care/ER now:\n- New severe or “worst” headache, stiff neck, fever.\n- Persistent vertigo with trouble walking, slurred speech, facial droop, weakness, double vision, or vision loss.\n- A spell lasting more than 5 minutes, repeated spells back‑to‑back, or injury/head trauma.\n- New chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting.\n\nSafety tips until evaluated:\n- Don’t drive if spells are frequent/unpredictable.\n- Avoid swimming alone, heights, hot tubs/baths; prefer showers.\n- Sit or lie down as soon as an episode starts; focus on slow diaphragmatic breathing.\n- Try to capture an episode on video and keep a symptom diary (time, duration, triggers, position, light exposure, heart rate, recovery).\n\nIf vertigo is triggered by rolling in bed, that suggests BPPV; a clinician can do a Dix‑Hallpike test and, if positive, perform the Epley maneuver. If vestibular migraine is suspected, preventive strategies (regular sleep, hydration, consistent caffeine, magnesium 400 mg/day, riboflavin 400 mg/day, CoQ10 100–300 mg/day) may help—confirm with your clinician given your current meds.\n\nA few questions to bring to your visit:\n- Are episodes triggered by position changes (lying down, turning in bed) or bright light?\n- Do you ever have a whooshing sound, ear fullness, or hearing changes?\n- Any missed/moved doses of clonazepam or trazodone, alcohol use, or recent illness?\n- Family history of migraine or epilepsy?\n- Can someone observe your eyes during an episode for side-to-side jerking?\n\nBottom line: Focal seizures are possible, and vestibular migraine/BPPV is also very plausible. Because your symptoms are recurrent and affecting function, please arrange neurology, primary care, and eye evaluations soon, and use the safety precautions above.",

MRI and CT scans normal. Neurolgist reported on EEH as ’essentially normal’ with no other details, but has advised GP diagnosis is presumed epilepsy however described it as a difficult case to diagnose. My question is why would he describe the EEG as ‘essentially normal’ rather than just normal?",
    "answer": "Short answer: “Essentially normal” usually means there were no definite epileptiform abnormalities, but there were minor, non‑specific or technical issues that keep the reader from calling it unequivocally “normal.” It does not imply anything worrying by itself.\n\nCommon reasons an EEG is described this way:\n- No epileptiform discharges were seen, but there were minor, non‑specific findings (for example slight asymmetry, occasional slow waves, benign normal variants, medication‑related fast activity, or artifact from movement/muscle).\n- The study had limitations (brief routine recording, mostly awake with little or no sleep, hyperventilation not done or cut short due to asthma, photic only, or significant artifact). These can make a technically “perfectly normal” label inappropriate.\n- In focal or nocturnal seizures (especially frontal lobe), scalp EEG is often normal between seizures and can even look “essentially normal” during events because deep generators and muscle artifact obscure signals.\n\nImportant context:\n- A single routine EEG only detects interictal epileptiform activity in about 30–50% of people with epilepsy. Repeated, sleep‑deprived, or prolonged video/ambulatory EEG increases yield (often >80% with multiple or long recordings).\n- Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis; a normal or “essentially normal” EEG does not rule it out, particularly with stereotyped nocturnal unilateral motor events and partial response to levetiracetam.\n\nPractical next steps you could discuss with your neurologist:\n- Obtain the full EEG report to see what minor findings or limitations led to “essentially normal.”\n- Consider a sleep‑deprived EEG, 24–72 hour ambulatory/home video‑EEG, or inpatient video‑EEG monitoring, ideally aiming to capture a nocturnal event.\n- Bring your partner’s videos to the lab/clinic; adding EMG channels during monitoring can help with unilateral motor events.\n- Review ongoing spells and whether medication adjustment or alternative/add‑on therapy is warranted.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft specific questions to ask your neurologist about the EEG report.",

    "question": "I want to donate plasma, partially because I have O negative blood and would be available every 4 weeks to donate. And partially because I discovered donating plasma also has health benefits for the donors such as reducing micro-plastics in the body.From what I can see online in the UK if you’re epileptic you can’t donate plasma/blood. I was wondering if anyone knew the reason for this? Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a ‘we’re worried you may have a seizure while donating’ kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it’s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn’t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can’t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",
    "answer": "Short answer for the UK: if you currently have epilepsy and are taking anti‑epileptic medication (e.g., levetiracetam/Keppra or eslicarbazepine), you are not eligible to donate blood or plasma with NHS Blood and Transplant. A doctor’s note does not override this. Most UK services will only consider you eligible if you have been completely seizure‑free for a defined period and have been off anti‑epileptic medication during that time (commonly 3 years). Policies are set nationally (JPAC/NHSBT) for safety and are not adjusted case‑by‑case.\n\nWhy the restriction exists\n- Donor safety is the main reason. Blood donation (and especially plasma/platelet apheresis) can create conditions that lower seizure threshold:\n  - Stress, pain, dehydration, and vasovagal reactions during/after donation.\n  - For apheresis, the citrate anticoagulant can transiently lower calcium, causing tingling, muscle twitching, and rarely tetany; in susceptible people this could precipitate a seizure.\n  - Some anti‑epileptic medicines (including eslicarbazepine) can affect sodium levels; combined fluid shifts or citrate effects add a small but real safety concern.\n- Recipient safety is a much smaller issue here. Trace amounts of anti‑epileptic drugs in donated components are not usually a reason for deferral (unlike a few specific drugs such as isotretinoin or thalidomide, which have dedicated deferrals). The restriction for epilepsy is primarily about protecting you.\n\nA few other points that may help\n- O negative is “universal” for red cells, not plasma. Universal plasma donors are typically group AB. Your O‑negative status is most valuable for whole‑blood/red‑cell donation (but the epilepsy criteria still apply).\n- In the UK, fresh frozen plasma for transfusion is usually sourced from male donors to reduce TRALI risk. Plasma collected for manufacture into medicines may accept all sexes, but epilepsy rules still apply.\n- If your situation changes in the future (e.g., seizure‑free and off anti‑epileptic meds for the required period), you can check eligibility again. The best source is NHSBT’s eligibility pages or their helpline (0300 123 23 23 in England).\n- The “health benefits” of donating for the donor are limited. There is some evidence that regular blood/plasma donation can lower levels of certain persistent chemicals (e.g., PFAS), but robust evidence that it meaningfully reduces “microplastics” or confers a health benefit to the donor is not established. Donation is encouraged for helping patients, not as a health intervention.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- If you’d still like to contribute: consider volunteering with NHSBT, encouraging others to donate, or registering for organ donation. If your epilepsy becomes quiescent and you stop medication under your neurologist’s guidance for the required period, revisit eligibility then.\n- If in doubt, contact NHSBT directly or check the online “Can I give blood?” tool and search “epilepsy” for the current wording, as policies can be updated.\n\nBottom line: While you’re on Keppra and eslicarbazepine for active epilepsy, UK guidelines defer you from blood and plasma donation for your safety, and this isn’t something a doctor’s note can override.",

    "question": "My friend is 19 and pregnant. She’s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing “seizures” while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn’t figure out what’s wrong. She doesn’t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a “seizure”. I say “seizure” because apparently the docs at the hospital didn’t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn’t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I’m only really looking for advice.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry she’s going through this—episodes like this in early pregnancy need careful follow-up. While I can’t diagnose the cause, here’s a practical plan you can use to keep her safe and help push the workup forward.\n\nGo to emergency care now if any of the following happen\n- A seizure or spell lasts >5 minutes, or repeated spells without full recovery between\n- New severe or “worst-ever” headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting with injury, heavy vaginal bleeding, fever, or persistent oxygen saturation <94% at rest\n- Marked weakness, trouble speaking, facial droop, or confusion that doesn’t clear within an hour\n\nWhy this could be happening (common possibilities to discuss with her doctors)\n- Convulsive syncope (brief loss of consciousness from low blood pressure or a heart rhythm problem can include brief jerks and post-event confusion). Low magnesium can contribute to dangerous heart rhythms.\n- Electrolyte/metabolic issues: low magnesium, low sodium, low calcium, low glucose. Hyperemesis (vomiting) can cause these and also thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which can affect the brain.\n- New-onset epilepsy (can start in young adults, even without family history).\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). These are real events but not due to abnormal brain electrical activity; they often need video-EEG to diagnose and respond to psychological therapy.\n- Breathing or circulation problems: asthma, pneumonia, sleep apnea, or (less commonly but important) a blood clot in the lungs. Oxygen saturations around 93% during episodes suggest some hypoxia or monitor artifact—this needs checking.\n- Early preeclampsia/eclampsia is very unlikely at 11 weeks, but rare situations (like molar pregnancy) can cause earlier symptoms—her OB will consider this based on ultrasound and labs.\n\nWhat to ask her doctors for next\n- Neurology:\n  - EEG (possibly sleep-deprived) and consider inpatient video-EEG if spells are frequent\n  - MRI brain without contrast (safe in pregnancy) if not already done\n- Cardiology:\n  - ECG and review of QT interval; consider ambulatory heart monitor (e.g., Zio patch 1–2 weeks) to look for arrhythmias\n  - Orthostatic vitals to assess for POTS/orthostatic hypotension\n- OB/Maternal-Fetal Medicine (high-risk OB):\n  - Review meds/supplements; assess for hyperemesis and hydration status\n  - If vomiting: treat aggressively and consider thiamine supplementation before IV dextrose\n  - Rule out rare pregnancy complications as indicated\n- Labs (repeat if needed): magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, glucose (including during/just after a spell), kidney/liver tests, CBC, thyroid, B12/folate; consider thiamine level (or treat empirically if vomiting), and iron studies. Urinalysis/ketones if dehydrated.\n- Respiratory evaluation if O2 sats are persistently <95%: exam, CXR if needed, and appropriate imaging if PE is suspected.\n\nMedication notes in pregnancy (for discussion with her doctors)\n- IV or oral magnesium repletion is generally safe in pregnancy and often necessary if low.\n- If antiseizure medicine is needed, levetiracetam or lamotrigine are commonly preferred in pregnancy. Avoid valproate if possible. Do not start or stop any seizure meds without neurology/OB guidance.\n- If she has significant vomiting, ask about thiamine (vitamin B1), often 100 mg/day; this is low risk and can prevent brain complications.\n\nSafety steps at home\n- No driving, swimming alone, bathing in a tub alone, climbing heights, or operating machinery until cleared by her doctors.\n- If an event occurs: time it, protect her head, roll her onto her side, don’t restrain or put anything in her mouth, and monitor breathing. Call emergency services if it lasts >5 minutes or she doesn’t recover.\n- Hydration, regular meals/snacks with protein to avoid low blood sugar, slow position changes, and consider compression stockings if lightheaded on standing (ask her doctor).\n- Verify pulse oximeter accuracy (warm fingers, remove nail polish). If resting SpO2 stays below 95% repeatedly, seek care.\n\nWhat information to capture for her doctors\n- Get a phone video of an episode if safe to do so.\n- Note triggers, position (lying, sitting, standing), warning symptoms (dizziness, visual changes, nausea), skin color change, eye position (open/closed), rhythm and side of movements, tongue bite (especially on the side), incontinence, duration, and how long confusion lasts.\n- Check a fingerstick glucose during or right after a spell if available.\n- Track blood pressure and pulse (lying/sitting/standing) once or twice daily for a few days.\n\nA few clarifying questions that could help tailor next steps\n- Is she having significant nausea/vomiting or weight loss?\n- Any new medicines or substances (including OTC, herbal, energy drinks, vaping, alcohol, or withdrawal from sedatives)?\n- Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or leg pain/swelling?\n- Any tongue biting, incontinence, or injuries during events?\n\nIf you want, share any recent test results or answers to the questions above, and I can help you draft a message to her doctors or suggest how to prioritize next steps.",

    "question": "22F, 110 poundsCurrent Medications- Lamictal 200 mg in the AM & PM so 400mg total a day. Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- Yes, a lesion can look smaller (or even seem to “disappear”) on later MRIs. That does not necessarily mean the epilepsy will stop.\n- Seizures come from abnormal electrical networks (“seizure focus”), and once that network is established, seizures can persist even if the original injury/lesion looks smaller.\n- Because you reliably seize when you miss one lamotrigine dose, your brain is still seizure‑prone. That argues against being in remission right now.\n\nWhy the MRI could show a “tiny possible lesion” now\n- Different scanners/techniques: A 3T vs 1.5T MRI, different slice thickness, or not using a dedicated “epilepsy protocol” can make lesions look different.\n- Resolution of swelling/blood products: After an injury, early MRI can show edema or inflammation around a damaged area; over time this resolves and leaves a smaller scar (gliosis), which can look “smaller.”\n- Reader variability and motion: Different radiologists and small patient motion can change what’s called.\n- Bottom line: shrinking on MRI doesn’t necessarily mean the epileptic focus is gone.\n\nWhat your events sound like\n- The quiet stare and looking off to one side before the full convulsion suggests a focal seizure that spreads to a generalized convulsion (focal to bilateral tonic‑clonic). Eye/head turning is often away from the seizure side.\n- That fits with a structural injury causing a focal “seizure focus.”\n\nWill seizures stop if the lesion shrinks?\n- Not predictably. The “scar” can keep generating abnormal discharges even if it’s small.\n- Some people do outgrow seizures or go into remission, but with structural‑cause epilepsy the chance of needing long‑term medication is higher.\n- A reasonable time to discuss a cautious med taper is only after years of being completely seizure‑free and with your neurologist’s guidance. Right now, missing a single dose triggers a seizure, so you’re not there yet.\n\nWhy a missed dose now triggers seizures (even if it didn’t before)\n- Lamotrigine levels fall enough after a missed dose to cross your personal seizure threshold.\n- Sleep loss, stress, illness, alcohol, and cannabis can lower seizure threshold and make you more sensitive to small level changes.\n- Epilepsy can also “sensitize” networks over time, making them easier to trigger.\n\nPractical steps to consider with your neurologist\n- Ask for an “epilepsy‑protocol” 3T MRI and a copy of the actual radiology report. Clarify: What exactly is the lesion (scar/gliosis, cortical dysplasia, mesial temporal sclerosis, etc.) and where is it?\n- Consider repeat EEG or video‑EEG if there’s any uncertainty about seizure onset side/zone.\n- Medication adherence: use alarms, blister packs, or a smart pillbox. If mornings are hard, ask about lamotrigine XR once daily to reduce the impact of a late or missed dose.\n- If you ever have seizures despite perfect adherence, tell your neurologist promptly—an add‑on medicine or dose change may be needed.\n- Triggers: keep sleep regular, avoid alcohol binges, avoid cold medicines with dextromethorphan or antihistamines that can provoke seizures.\n- Cannabis: THC can lower seizure threshold; CBD can raise lamotrigine levels and cause side effects. If you use cannabis, keep it consistent, avoid high‑THC products, and discuss with your neurologist.\n- Safety and rescue plan: have a rescue med (e.g., intranasal midazolam) if your doctor recommends it; call EMS if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, repeats without recovery, or causes injury.\n- Lifestyle safety: showers not baths, don’t swim alone, avoid heights/open flames alone. Follow local driving laws (often 6–12 months seizure‑free).\n\nWhen might seizures stop?\n- Many with focal epilepsy achieve long periods of seizure freedom on meds. After 2–5 years seizure‑free, some can taper under supervision.\n- Because yours are triggered by a single missed dose, the goal now is rock‑solid adherence and trigger control. If you can maintain a long seizure‑free period, your neurologist can reassess long‑term plans.\n\nIf you share the exact wording from your MRI reports (old and new), I can help translate them and explain what changed.",

This has been happening every other day in the last 2 weeks.I'm coughing up phelgmn and I've tried warm water to force the pill down as it is a enteric-coated pill, which reacts with water straight away. The longer the pill stays in my throat, it scrapes my throat and blood comes out with my spit. My throat is sore afterwards which takes two days to recover. I have to take my Epilepsy pills for life.I'm afraid to keep taking the 500ml tablets in the evening, as I keep having this reaction.Should I take 5 of the 200mg pills instead to make up the 1000mg required in the evening which are easier to swallow or do something else?I'm going to speak to my pharmacist and GP tomorrow morning as well about it.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry this is happening — pills getting stuck and causing bleeding is scary and can injure your throat or esophagus.\n\nKey points first\n- Do not crush, split, or chew Epilim Chrono (modified‑release/enteric‑coated) tablets.\n- Don’t change the strength or formulation on your own. Only substitute 5 x 200 mg if they are the exact same formulation (e.g., “Epilim Chrono 200 mg modified‑release”) and your pharmacist/GP confirms. If your 200 mg tablet is a different type (e.g., gastro‑resistant/EC or immediate‑release), the release profile and dosing may differ.\n- If you cannot swallow the 500 mg tablet safely tonight and can’t reach a pharmacist/doctor for advice, it’s safer to avoid repeated attempts that could cause choking or bleeding. Do not double up later unless a clinician tells you to. Call an out‑of‑hours pharmacy/GP if possible.\n- Seek urgent care now if you have severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, persistent bleeding, vomiting blood, black stools, fever, or if food/liquids are also getting stuck.\n\nWhat to discuss with your pharmacist/GP tomorrow\n- Switch to smaller tablets of the same modified‑release formulation (e.g., 200 mg MR tablets to make up the evening dose).\n- Consider a non‑tablet option: prolonged‑release granules/sprinkles or an oral liquid. If changed to an immediate‑release liquid, they may adjust how often you take it to keep levels steady.\n- Timing: take the evening dose earlier and remain upright for at least 30 minutes afterward (avoid taking it right before bed).\n- Evaluation for pill‑induced esophagitis and possible underlying swallowing issues (especially since there’s blood and this is new). They may consider tests or referral if needed.\n\nHow to get tonight’s dose down more safely (if you do take it)\n- Take while sitting or standing upright; stay upright for 30–60 minutes after.\n- Pre‑wet your mouth/throat with a few sips of water first.\n- Use plenty of fluid (at least a full glass).\n- Try swallowing the whole tablet embedded in a spoonful of soft food with some “grip,” like yogurt, applesauce, or pudding; or use a pharmacy “pill‑swallowing gel” (e.g., Gloup/Pill Glide).\n- Chin‑tuck technique: place the tablet on your tongue, take a sip, tuck your chin slightly toward your chest, and swallow. For some people this helps direct the pill down the esophagus.\n- Avoid taking it immediately after a very dry meal or when your mouth is dry; sip water for a few minutes first.\n\nIf a tablet feels stuck\n- Don’t lie down. Take several sips of water. If needed, try a small bite of soft food (e.g., banana, yogurt) to help move it.\n- If the sensation persists, severe pain develops, or you keep coughing/choking, seek urgent care.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Large modified‑release tablets can lodge in the esophagus and cause abrasions/ulcers (“pill esophagitis”), which explains the pain and blood. Repeated injury can lead to more serious problems, so adjusting the form/technique is important.\n\nGiven your epilepsy, avoiding missed doses is important, but it should not come at the expense of choking or bleeding. Your plan to speak with your pharmacist and GP in the morning is exactly right — ask specifically about switching to smaller same‑formulation tablets or a liquid/granule option, and about evaluation for swallowing issues if this continues.",

    "question": "23F, 5'8, 134 lbs, medications: trokendi xr switching over to topiramate, nonsmoker, epileptic, no location, and no photo.Hello, my medication trokendi xr is currently on backorder, and my neurologist sent a new prescription in for some generic topiramate. The only question I did not get to ask him was if I have to continue only taking 1 a day since trokendi is an extended release or if I have to take 2 a day. Thanks!",
    "answer": "Short answer: If your new prescription is for regular (immediate‑release) topiramate, it’s usually taken twice a day. Trokendi XR is extended‑release and is taken once daily.\n\nHow to confirm:\n- Check the new prescription/bottle. If it says “topiramate ER/XR/extended‑release,” it’s once daily. If it does not say ER/XR, it’s immediate‑release and typically taken twice daily.\n- Your pharmacist can tell you exactly how your neurologist prescribed it (they can see the directions on the e‑script).\n\nTypical switch guidance:\n- When moving from Trokendi XR to immediate‑release topiramate, clinicians usually keep the same total daily dose but split it into two equal doses about 12 hours apart. Example: 100 mg Trokendi XR once daily often becomes 50 mg topiramate twice daily.\n- Do not take both XR and IR together unless specifically told to.\n\nImportant safety notes:\n- Don’t stop topiramate abruptly—this can increase seizure risk.\n- If you’re out of Trokendi and need to start the new medication before you can reach your doctor, call the pharmacy; they can confirm the exact dosing instructions your neurologist sent.\n- Watch for changes in seizure control or new side effects (tingling, cognitive slowing) during the switch and report them.\n- Stay well hydrated. If you use hormonal birth control and your total daily dose is 200 mg or more, effectiveness can be reduced—ask about backup contraception.\n\nIf you share the exact strength and directions on the new bottle, I can help interpret them.",

    "question": "Before I start of with everything I am diagnosed with BPD, epilepsy, anxiety, aura headaches, pcos, and vertigo. It started with me just getting vertigo in 2019 and it went away with medication but came back within a week and i got chest pains and went to see a cardiologist and everything was okay. I was then sent to a neurologist and they finally diagnosed me with epilepsy but I don't have seizures. for awhile though i was having episodes of \"falling into the ground\" feelings and if i was in the car it would feel like i was falling back. I would just get odd feelings like that. i was told i basically have micro seizures. there's times where i get dizzy and don't feel good or just don't feel right and im guessing it could just be depersonalization but I'm honestly not sure. l've been now struggling with a migraine for over a month now and i had a mri done that came out normal and im having another one and a mra done tomorrow to see if something looks off. I've been struggling with migraines for awhile but never like this. I'm honestly just hoping maybe someone has had a similar experience or a answer? idk I've been in so much painMedications: metaformin Aimoveg, only one shot so far venlafaxine bupropion Mag oxide ToprimateHeight; 5'7 Weight: 180 I only smoke sometimes , I never drink alcohol",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this—what you’re describing is exhausting and scary. A few thoughts you can take to your neurologist tomorrow, plus some things you can do now.\n\nWhat could be going on\n- Status migrainosus: a migraine that won’t fully break and lasts more than 72 hours. This often needs “rescue” treatment from a clinic/ED (IV meds, steroids, etc.), not just preventives.\n- Vestibular migraine or PPPD (persistent postural-perceptual dizziness): can cause vertigo, rocking/falling sensations, motion sensitivity, and “not-right/derealization” feelings, often triggered by a prior vestibular problem or migraine.\n- Focal (temporal lobe) seizures/auras: brief “falling” or odd internal sensations can be focal aware seizures. An ambulatory EEG may help if episodes are frequent.\n- Medication effects or interactions:\n  - Bupropion is usually contraindicated in people with a seizure disorder (it lowers seizure threshold).\n  - Venlafaxine can also lower seizure threshold and can raise blood pressure, which can worsen headaches.\n  - Aimovig (erenumab) can raise blood pressure in some people.\n  - Topiramate is a good preventive for both migraine and seizures, but can cause dizziness/brain fog.\n- Medication overuse headache: if you’re taking pain relievers or triptans most days, headaches can become daily and stubborn.\n- Dysautonomia/orthostatic intolerance (e.g., POTS): dizziness, chest discomfort, and “not right” feelings, worse standing up, sometimes coexists with migraine.\n\nRed flags: seek urgent care/ED now if you have any of the following\n- “Worst headache of your life,” sudden thunderclap onset\n- Fever, neck stiffness, new weakness, vision loss, facial droop, slurred speech, confusion, fainting\n- Severe new pattern after head injury\n- Uncontrolled vomiting, dehydration, or blood pressure readings persistently high (e.g., >160/100)\n\nWhat to discuss with your neurologist tomorrow\n1) Is this status migrainosus, and can we set a rescue plan?\n   - Options: triptan/gepant/ditan at home; short steroid burst (e.g., dexamethasone); anti-nausea meds (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine); IV infusion protocol (fluids, ketorolac, magnesium, antiemetic, valproate, dihydroergotamine) if severe.\n2) Are my meds optimal and safe with epilepsy?\n   - Strongly ask about bupropion given your seizure diagnosis; many clinicians avoid it in epilepsy.\n   - Ask whether venlafaxine is appropriate or if another antidepressant with less seizure risk (e.g., sertraline) might be safer.\n   - Check your blood pressure and review Aimovig’s BP effect; decide whether to continue Aimovig (often needs 2–3 months to judge benefit).\n   - Confirm your topiramate dose and target (many need 50–100 mg twice daily for migraine prevention, if tolerated).\n3) Could this be vestibular migraine or PPPD?\n   - Consider vestibular physical therapy and a specific treatment plan (short-term vestibular suppressants like meclizine for acute vertigo, migraine rescue meds, and rehab).\n4) Are these episodes seizures?\n   - Consider ambulatory/video EEG to capture events; adjust antiseizure therapy if needed.\n5) Screen for medication overuse headache and set limits on acute meds (generally <10 days/month for triptans, <15 for NSAIDs/acetaminophen).\n\nPractical steps you can start now\n- Track blood pressure daily for a week (especially if headaches surge). Bring readings to your visit.\n- Keep a brief symptom/trigger log: sleep, stress, foods/caffeine, menses/hormones, position/motion, screens, meds taken.\n- Acute home options (if safe for you and approved by your doc):\n  - Early in an attack: NSAID (naproxen or ibuprofen) + acetaminophen, hydration, dark quiet room, cold pack to head/neck.\n  - If you have a prescribed antiemetic, take it—these often help pain too.\n  - If you don’t have a rescue triptan/gepant/ditan, ask for one.\n- Lifestyle supports:\n  - Regular sleep/wake, meals, hydration; limit nicotine (smoking + migraine with aura increases stroke risk).\n  - Gentle, regular movement as tolerated.\n  - Magnesium oxide 400–600 mg nightly is reasonable; discuss adding riboflavin (B2 400 mg/day) or CoQ10 (100–300 mg/day) with your doctor.\n- If dizziness worsens when upright or in visually busy places, try:\n  - Slow position changes, compression socks, adequate fluids/salt (if your BP allows), and ask about referral to vestibular therapy.\n\nA few clarifying questions to help tailor advice\n- What dose of topiramate and magnesium are you on?\n- Do you have a prescribed “rescue” medication for migraine? How often are you using any pain meds?\n- Any home BP readings recently?\n- Do the “falling” spells last seconds or minutes, and do you remain fully aware during them?\n- Are you on any hormonal birth control? (Estrogen-containing pills are usually avoided in migraine with aura.)\n\nYou’re doing the right things by getting the MRI/MRA and staying engaged with neurology. Given the duration and severity, I’d push for a clear rescue plan and a medication safety review (especially bupropion and blood pressure monitoring with Aimovig/venlafaxine). If the pain becomes unmanageable or you develop any red flags above, go to urgent care/ED for a migraine infusion.",

    "question": "So i had an epilepsy seizure when i was like 4-5 months old. I took medication daily for 7 years, and i had no more seizures. Im 17 years old now. Can my epilepsy come back? If it can what can cause it?",
    "answer": "Short answer: it can come back, but after so many years seizure‑free—especially if you’ve been off medicine for a long time—the chance is generally low.\n\nWhat affects your personal risk\n- Why you had seizures: Kids with a normal MRI/EEG, normal development, and “self‑limited” childhood epilepsies have a low long‑term relapse risk. If there’s a structural brain problem, developmental issues, or a known epilepsy syndrome, the risk is higher.\n- Time since stopping meds: Most relapses (if they happen) occur in the first 1–2 years after stopping. After 5+ years seizure‑free, recurrence becomes uncommon, though never zero.\n- Past treatment: Needing multiple medications, having multiple seizure types, or an abnormal EEG at the time meds were stopped increases risk.\n\nCommon triggers to avoid\n- Sleep deprivation and irregular sleep schedules\n- Illness/fever; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance\n- Alcohol (especially binge drinking) and recreational drugs (stimulants like cocaine/amphetamines/MDMA; also higher‑dose THC)\n- Certain medications that can lower seizure threshold (examples: bupropion, tramadol, some antidepressants/antipsychotics, some antibiotics like imipenem or fluoroquinolones, high‑dose diphenhydramine)\n- Flashing lights or intense visual patterns if you’re photosensitive\n- Significant stress; in some people, hormonal changes\n\nPractical advice\n- Keep good sleep, hydration, and alcohol/drug avoidance habits.\n- Tell any doctor or pharmacist you have a seizure history before starting new meds.\n- Seek medical review if you notice possible seizure signs (staring spells, lost time, sudden jerks on awakening, brief blackouts, odd déjà vu with nausea/fear).\n- If you ever have a seizure: keep you safe on your side, time it, and call emergency services if it lasts 5 minutes or longer or repeats without full recovery.\n\nIf you’re unsure why you had seizures as a baby or whether you’re still considered “in remission,” a quick check‑in with a neurologist (and possibly an updated EEG only if there are concerns) can give you personalized risk and guidance for things like sports, driving, and work. If you’d like, tell me:\n- Whether you’re currently off medication and for how long\n- If you ever had an abnormal EEG/MRI\n- Any family history of seizures\n- Any recent symptoms that worry you\n\nI can help interpret what that means for your risk.",

    "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed “what was that” and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it’s “interesting”.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I’m just trying to help find answers.",
    "answer": "Short answer\nThis sounds most like a reflex faint (syncope) with brief “anoxic” convulsions, probably triggered by a cold stimulus while eating ice cream. That is different from epilepsy. The cold/pain stimulus can cause a strong vagal reflex that briefly slows the heart and breathing, leading to loss of consciousness and a few jerks. A normal EEG and the very fast recovery support syncope rather than an epileptic seizure. However, because some heart rhythm problems can also present as fainting with jerks, she should be evaluated for cardiac causes too.\n\nWhy this fits\n- Clear trigger: eating very cold ice cream; she’s fainted with ice cream before, and once after being hit (pain/startle). These are classic triggers for reflex syncope/breath‑holding type events.\n- Typical syncope features: sudden stillness, brief unresponsiveness (~20 seconds), pallor/stiffness, a few convulsive movements, very quick reorientation (“what was that?”) without prolonged confusion.\n- Normal EEG: does not rule out epilepsy, but supports syncope, especially with a classic trigger and fast recovery.\n\nPossible mechanisms/diagnoses to discuss with her doctors\n- Cold-stimulus/swallow syncope (vagally mediated). Cold foods/drinks can trigger a powerful vagal reflex (similar to “brain freeze”/trigeminocardiac reflex), causing brief bradycardia/asystole and fainting. Reported with ice-cold drinks.\n- Reflex anoxic seizures (a form of convulsive syncope) or pallid breath-holding spells. Pain/fear/startle triggers a brief cardiac pause → faint → brief jerks. Most common in young children and often outgrown.\n- Less likely but important to exclude: cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., long QT, AV block, WPW) or structural heart disease. These can cause fainting with convulsions and can be dangerous, though the consistent cold/ice-cream trigger and quick recovery make this lower on the list.\n- True epileptic seizures triggered by eating are rare; normal EEG and the pattern here make epilepsy less likely.\n\nNo good evidence links sugar or dairy themselves to fainting or seizures. Reactive hypoglycemia wouldn’t happen instantly while eating. Allergy/anaphylaxis would have other signs (hives, wheeze, vomiting), which you didn’t describe.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Pediatric visit soon; ask for:\n  - 12‑lead ECG (to screen for long QT, conduction problems).\n  - Consider referral to pediatric cardiology. They may suggest ambulatory monitoring (Holter/event monitor) and, in select cases, supervised “cold drink/ice-cream” provocation while on ECG to confirm a reflex mechanism. Echocardiogram if any cardiac concerns.\n  - Pediatric neurology follow‑up if uncertainty remains. Video of any future episode is extremely helpful.\n  - Iron studies (ferritin, CBC). Iron deficiency can worsen breath‑holding/reflex anoxic events; supplementation often reduces episodes even without anemia.\n- Avoid triggers for now:\n  - Skip very cold foods/drinks, especially big bites/gulps or through a straw.\n  - Let foods warm slightly; take small, slow sips/bites.\n  - Maintain good hydration, regular meals, sleep.\n\nWhat to do during an episode\n- At first warning (headache, dizziness, “I don’t feel right”): have her lie down flat immediately with legs elevated. This can abort many reflex faints.\n- If she loses consciousness: lay her on her side, keep airway clear, do not put anything in her mouth, and time the event.\n- Call emergency services if:\n  - She does not start to wake within about 1 minute, or isn’t breathing normally, or turns blue.\n  - There is a significant injury, the spell happens during exercise, or there’s chest pain or palpitations.\n  - You cannot feel normal breathing or a pulse—start CPR and call EMS.\n\nReassurance and prognosis\n- Reflex syncope and reflex anoxic seizures are frightening but usually benign and commonly outgrown by early school age.\n- The pattern you describe strongly favors this over epilepsy. Still, getting the ECG/cardiac check is important to rule out rarer but serious heart causes.\n\nKeywords you can mention to her doctors\n- “Cold-stimulus syncope,” “swallow syncope,” “trigeminocardiac reflex,” “reflex anoxic seizures/convulsive syncope,” “pallid breath-holding spells.”\n\nIf you can, capture a clear video of any future episode and note the exact trigger, position (sitting/standing), color change, breathing, duration, and recovery—this greatly helps the diagnosis.",

    "question": "27 female, I suffer from autism, epilepsy, depressionLymph node on left side of neck is swollen, hearing loss, ears feel blocked, headache and can’t sleep or eat much. I take lamotrigine and clozapam",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. A swollen neck lymph node on one side with blocked ears, hearing loss, and headache suggests an ear or throat infection, or fluid behind the eardrum. Because you also have epilepsy and your sleep/food intake are affected, you should be seen by a clinician within 24 hours for an ear, throat, and neck exam.\n\nGo to urgent care or the ER sooner if any of these happen:\n- Severe ear pain, swelling/redness behind the ear, the ear sticking out, or a high fever\n- Sudden hearing loss in one ear without a feeling of blockage or with loud ringing (needs treatment within 24–72 hours)\n- Stiff neck, severe or worsening headache, confusion, vomiting, rash, trouble swallowing, drooling, voice changes, or rapidly enlarging/hard neck swelling\n- Worsening seizures, new neurological symptoms, or signs of dehydration\n\nWhat to do now\n- Pain/fever: Acetaminophen 650–1000 mg every 6–8 hours (max 3,000 mg/day) or ibuprofen 400 mg every 6–8 hours with food (avoid if you have stomach ulcers, kidney disease, or are pregnant).\n- Congestion/ear pressure: Use saline nasal spray or rinse. A steroid nasal spray (fluticasone or mometasone) once daily for a few days can help Eustachian tube swelling.\n- Non-drug measures: Warm compress over the ear/neck, rest with head elevated, sip fluids, soft foods.\n- Avoid: Q-tips/ear candles; oral decongestants like pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine (can lower seizure threshold); sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine (increase sedation with clonazepam/clobazam and can lower seizure threshold).\n\nMedication safety with your epilepsy meds\n- Keep taking lamotrigine and your benzodiazepine as prescribed.\n- If you’re given an antibiotic and you develop any new rash, mouth sores, or skin peeling, seek care urgently and tell them you’re on lamotrigine.\n- Avoid new sedatives, alcohol, or sleep aids; they can interact with clonazepam/clobazam and affect seizures.\n\nQuestions to help guide care (answer what you can):\n- How long have the symptoms been present? Any fever? How painful is it?\n- Is the hearing loss in one or both ears? Did it come on suddenly or gradually? Any ringing or vertigo?\n- Any sore throat, dental pain, recent cold, or ear discharge?\n- Is the neck node tender, warm/red, or getting bigger? Any night sweats, unintentional weight loss?\n- Are you on clonazepam or clobazam? Any medication allergies, especially to penicillin? Are you pregnant?\n\nGiven your symptoms, please arrange an urgent visit today or tomorrow with your GP or urgent care. They may check your ears for infection or fluid, test your hearing, and decide if antibiotics or other treatment are needed. If anything acutely worsens or you notice the red flags above, seek emergency care.",

    "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven’t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
    "answer": "What you describe fits best with “situational” or reflex syncope related to heavy, isometric effort and Valsalva (breath‑holding) during/after exercise. Pull‑ups are a classic trigger because they:\n- Encourage Valsalva, which transiently lowers venous return and blood pressure\n- Are isometric and overhead, which can reduce venous return and promote a vagal reflex\n- Often end abruptly, so you lose the skeletal‑muscle pump and can have a post‑exercise BP drop\n\nWhy your ideas make sense\n- Vagal/hiatal hernia link: There are case reports of syncope from esophageal/hiatal hernia stimulation (vagally mediated bradycardia/asystole) and, in large hernias, even mechanical compression of the left atrium. Heavy straining can accentuate this. It’s not common, but it’s plausible.\n- PPI‑related deficiencies: Long‑term PPIs can cause hypomagnesemia, B12 and iron deficiency. Low magnesium, in particular, can cause dizziness and arrhythmias. This wouldn’t usually only happen after pull‑ups, but a deficiency could lower your margin for tolerance during hard efforts.\n\nWhy it likely wasn’t epilepsy\n- Episodes were predictably tied to workouts, not random; stopping the trigger stopped the events; and your neuro evaluation didn’t support epilepsy.\n\nPractical steps if you’d like to return to pull‑ups safely\n1) Re‑check the basics (given your age now and elapsed time):\n- Resting ECG and echocardiogram (if it’s been years)\n- Exercise stress test with BP/ECG monitoring; ideally try to reproduce symptoms on supervised lat pull‑downs or assisted pull‑ups\n- Wear a 1–2 week patch monitor for several gym sessions to look for arrhythmias\n- Labs: CBC, electrolytes, magnesium, B12, ferritin/iron, TSH\n- If you ever had arm symptoms or big BP differences between arms, consider bilateral arm BPs and, if abnormal, vascular ultrasound to exclude subclavian steal (rare, but arm‑overhead exertion can unmask it)\n\n2) Training adjustments that often prevent recurrence:\n- Don’t hold your breath; exhale through the effort\n- Avoid maximal isometrics and kipping; keep neck neutral (don’t hyperextend)\n- Hydrate and include electrolytes; don’t lift right after a big meal\n- Warm up well and cool down by walking; don’t stop abruptly after a hard set\n- Start with assisted pull‑ups or bands, low reps, long rest, and progress slowly\n- If you feel light‑headed, lie supine with legs elevated right away\n\n3) GERD/hiatal hernia and PPI review:\n- Use the lowest effective PPI dose; consider a step‑down trial or adding an H2 blocker with your clinician if feasible\n- Check magnesium, B12, and iron periodically; replete if low\n- If the hernia is large/symptomatic or you’re interested in definitive treatment, discuss surgical options with GI/foregut surgery\n\nRed flags that should prompt prompt cardiology/sports‑cardiology review\n- Syncope during (not just after) exercise, chest pain, palpitations, or new shortness of breath\n- Family history of sudden cardiac death or known arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy\n- Abnormal ECG, murmur, or recurrent episodes despite technique and hydration changes\n\nBottom line\n- Your history (triggered by pull‑ups, resolved by avoiding them) points most strongly to a reflex/vasovagal mechanism from Valsalva/isometric strain, with hiatal hernia–vagal stimulation and PPI‑related deficiencies as possible contributors.\n- With a brief re‑evaluation and careful re‑introduction (assisted, no breath‑holding, good hydration, gradual progression), many people can return to pull‑ups safely.\n\nIf you can share: did the episodes happen during the set vs a few minutes after, any palpitations, and whether they were more likely soon after eating? That detail can further narrow the likely mechanism and how to tailor your return.",

    "question": "I wanted to share my experience with you to maybe get some more information about my situation.For 10 years, I have been experiencing every couple of months sudden deja vu like feeling followed by dissociation. I don’t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I’m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing this—it sounds unsettling, and you’re doing the right thing by asking questions.\n\nWhat you describe—sudden déjà vu followed by a dissociative feeling, no loss of consciousness or shaking, fading over ~20 minutes every couple of months—has a few possible explanations. The main ones to consider are:\n\n- Focal aware (temporal lobe) seizures: These can cause strong déjà vu and a rising stomach feeling, odd smells/tastes, sudden fear, or brief speech arrest. They’re usually very brief (seconds to 1–2 minutes). The suddenness and stereotyped nature fits, but the 20-minute duration is longer than typical.\n- Panic/dissociation episodes: Panic and depersonalization/derealization can start abruptly and last 10–30 minutes, even without an obvious trigger. They often include a wave of unreality, lightheadedness, heart racing, tingling, and then a gradual fade—this timing matches what you describe, and GAD can predispose to this, even when you don’t feel “stressed.”\n- Migraine aura (including “acephalgic” migraine): Auras last 5–60 minutes and can include perceptual disturbances and derealization, sometimes without a headache. Déjà vu is less classic but can occur in some migraine variants.\n- Less common: medication/substance effects (including cannabis), sleep deprivation, hypoglycemia, or (rarely) transient ischemic events if there are vascular risk factors.\n\nGiven the 20-minute duration and preserved consciousness, panic/dissociation or migraine aura are statistically more likely than classic temporal lobe seizures—but because repeated, stereotyped déjà vu is a hallmark of temporal lobe seizures, it’s reasonable to get a neurological evaluation at least once.\n\nWhat to do next\n- See your primary care clinician and consider a referral to a neurologist.\n- Typical workup if seizures are a concern:\n  - Brain MRI (with an epilepsy protocol focusing on the temporal lobes).\n  - EEG; a sleep-deprived or ambulatory EEG can increase the chance of catching abnormalities if a routine EEG is normal.\n- If the neurologic workup is normal, discuss anxiety-related depersonalization/derealization or migraine with your clinician. Panic attacks can occur “out of the blue.”\n\nTrack your episodes to help your clinician\n- Note date/time, what you were doing, sleep the night before, caffeine/alcohol/cannabis, any smells/tastes or rising stomach sensation, heart rate, fear, automatisms (lip smacking, hand rubbing), confusion after, headache afterward, and total duration.\n- If safe, ask someone to record you during an episode; a smartwatch heart rate trace can also help.\n\nSafety tips\n- If one starts while driving, pull over until it passes.\n- Avoid heights, swimming alone, or operating dangerous machinery until you’ve been evaluated.\n- Driving rules after suspected seizures vary by region—ask your clinician. Since you don’t lose awareness, restrictions may differ.\n\nWays to cope if anxiety/dissociation is the cause\n- Grounding: 5-4-3-2-1 senses, hold ice/cold water, name objects/colors around you.\n- Slow breathing: in 4 seconds, out 6–8 seconds for several minutes.\n- Regular sleep, limit alcohol/cannabis, consistent exercise.\n- CBT can be very effective for panic/derealization; SSRIs/SNRIs can help if anxiety is driving this.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or worsening episodes; loss of consciousness; injury; prolonged confusion; weakness on one side, trouble speaking, or a new severe headache; fever or stiff neck; or if an episode lasts longer than an hour.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you build a brief symptom log template and a list of questions to take to your appointment.",

    "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I’d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn’t the medication, anxiety and cat’s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I’ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn’t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",
    "answer": "Strongest suspicion: chronic carbon monoxide (CO) exposure in the basement suite.\n\nWhy it fits:\n- Symptoms: Low-level CO poisoning commonly causes morning nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and “flu-like” symptoms without fever. It often worsens overnight (exposure while sleeping) and improves rapidly after leaving the space—exactly what you describe for all three of you, including the cat.\n- Timing: All three started having symptoms after moving in, and all symptoms stopped immediately upon moving out.\n- Setting: Basement suites are higher risk for backdrafting or poor venting from gas appliances (furnace, boiler, water heater), attached garages, or other combustion sources. CO is odorless and invisible; detectors may have been missing, old, or placed poorly.\n\nOther possibilities (less likely but worth noting):\n- Sewer gas (hydrogen sulfide/methane/ammonia) from a dry trap or venting problem can cause morning nausea. A plumber’s smoke test can check this.\n- Significant mold/moisture problems can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, but respiratory/eye symptoms are more typical, and the “overnight-worse/morning-better outdoors” pattern is more classic for CO.\n- Off-gassing VOCs or pesticide residues could cause nausea, but would be less predictably worse in the morning and less likely to affect all three so consistently for years.\n\nWhat to do now:\n- Ensure your new home has working CO detectors on every level and outside sleeping areas. Test monthly and replace units older than 5–7 years.\n- Notify the property owner/manager, realtor, and local gas utility or fire department that there may be a CO hazard. They can inspect appliances, venting, and draft, and check for sewer gas issues if indicated.\n- If anyone currently lives there, advise them to install CO detectors immediately and get an urgent HVAC/safety check.\n- If you or your husband develop lingering issues like headaches, cognitive fog, or mood changes, mention possible past CO exposure to your clinician. There’s no useful blood test now (levels normalize within hours), but it can guide evaluation.\n\nMedication note: Keppra and lamotrigine can cause nausea, but they wouldn’t explain identical timing in your husband and cat, nor the abrupt resolution the day you moved. Do not change your seizure meds without your neurologist’s guidance.\n\nYou did the right thing by moving and by planning to alert others. CO is a common, under-recognized cause of exactly this story.",

    "question": "My little sister, age 12, was diagnosed with epilepsy for the last 1 year. She has been taking necessary medications for its cure and prevention. However, she has been ill for the last few days and we ran a few tests waiting to get reports tomorrow. It's 3am now and she has been acting and moving her body weirdly while sleeping for the last hour, we're suspecting she's having nocturnal epilepsy. Moreover, she has been telling us she feels tremor in her stomach for the past 3 days. It would be really nice if anyone could answer the following questions    What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?    What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—watching a loved one have possible seizures is scary. Because it’s 3am and you’re seeing unusual movements for about an hour, please prioritize safety right now:\n\nIf she is currently having a seizure or repeated episodes:\n- Start timing. If any convulsive episode lasts 5 minutes, or she has repeated events without fully waking/returning to normal between them, give the prescribed rescue medication (e.g., buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam) and call emergency services.\n- If you do not have rescue medication and the abnormal movements seem ongoing or keep recurring, call emergency services now.\n- Seizure first aid: lay her on her side, clear the area, cushion her head, loosen tight clothing, do not put anything in her mouth, don’t restrain her, and watch her breathing and color.\n- Call emergency services immediately if: breathing is difficult/blue/very noisy, there’s a serious injury, the seizure lasts >5 minutes, she does not regain awareness after 10–15 minutes once it stops, another seizure follows without full recovery, or you’re unsure what you’re seeing.\n\nAbout the “stomach tremor” for 3 days: in epilepsy, a rising or churning feeling in the stomach (“epigastric aura”) can be a focal seizure. It can also be GI upset or anxiety. Capture video if you can, note the timing and triggers, and tell her neurologist in the morning.\n\nAnswers to your questions\n\n1) What causes epilepsy in general?\n- Epilepsy is recurrent seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Common causes in children:\n  - Genetic epilepsies (no structural brain problem on MRI).\n  - Structural causes (e.g., cortical dysplasia, scarring from prior injury/infection, rarely tumors).\n  - Metabolic/autoimmune/infectious causes.\n  - Sleep-related epilepsies (e.g., sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, formerly nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy).\n- Triggers that lower seizure threshold: sleep deprivation, illness/fever, missed doses, dehydration, some medications, stress, flashing lights in photosensitive epilepsy.\n\n2) Precautions to help control/prevent seizures\n- Medications:\n  - Give antiepileptic meds exactly on time, every day. Don’t skip or stop abruptly.\n  - During illness (fever, vomiting/diarrhea), keep her hydrated and keep fever down; call your clinician if she can’t keep meds down or you’re unsure about redosing.\n  - Tell her doctor about any new medicines; some can interact or lower seizure threshold.\n- Sleep and routine:\n  - Keep a regular sleep schedule; prioritize adequate sleep.\n  - Manage stress; regular meals and hydration.\n- Triggers:\n  - Avoid sleep loss; be cautious with flashing lights if she’s photosensitive.\n  - Avoid energy drinks/stimulants. (Alcohol isn’t relevant at age 12 but is a trigger.)\n- Monitoring and follow-up:\n  - Keep a seizure diary: date/time, description, duration, triggers, missed doses, illness, period onset (if applicable).\n  - Bring videos of events to appointments.\n  - Growth can require dose adjustments—regular follow-up is important.\n- Rescue plan:\n  - Have a written plan for when to use rescue medication and when to call emergency services; make sure caregivers and school know it.\n\n3) What to do or ensure when she has one during sleep\n- If you suspect a nocturnal seizure:\n  - Follow seizure first aid (side position, clear space, time it, rescue med per plan).\n  - After, let her rest; expect temporary confusion/sleepiness.\n- Nighttime safety and monitoring:\n  - Consider a low bed or mattress on the floor, remove sharp objects, pad corners, avoid top bunks.\n  - Place her on her side to sleep. Some families use audio/video baby monitors; seizure-detection devices can help alert you, though none are perfect.\n  - If events are frequent, ask about overnight video-EEG to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment.\n\n4) Habits and environment to reduce risk of injury\n- Home:\n  - Shower instead of baths; bathroom door unlocked; someone nearby when bathing.\n  - Use back burners, long sleeves for cooking; avoid carrying hot liquids alone if seizures are uncontrolled.\n  - Stair gates/handrails, window guards if needed.\n- Activities:\n  - Swimming only with 1:1 close supervision by an adult who knows seizure first aid; life jacket for boating; avoid open water without trained supervision.\n  - Biking/skating with a helmet; avoid heights/climbing until seizures are well controlled.\n  - For drop attacks, ask about protective headgear.\n- School/care:\n  - Provide the school with a seizure action plan and rescue medication if prescribed; train staff.\n\nA few additional points\n- Illness can temporarily increase seizures—optimize rest, fluids, and fever control (acetaminophen/ibuprofen as directed).\n- The “stomach tremor” could be a focal seizure aura; report it, especially since it’s new and recurring.\n- If she’s on valproate, carbamazepine, or other drugs that require blood level monitoring, ask if levels should be checked—growth over a year can mean the dose needs updating.\n- SUDEP risk is low in children but real; lowering risk includes good seizure control, not sleeping face down, supervision at night when seizures are active, and adherence to meds.\n\nWhat to do next\n- If she’s stable now and there have been brief, separated events with full recovery, call her neurologist first thing in the morning to report the nocturnal events and abdominal sensations. Ask whether any dose adjustments, blood tests, or an urgent visit are needed.\n- If the odd movements continue tonight, happen back-to-back without full recovery, or you’re unsure she’s okay, use rescue medication per your plan and call emergency services.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- What medication(s) and doses she’s taking and when she last took them.\n- Whether you have rescue medication at home and what it is.\n- A brief description of the current episodes (duration, movements, awareness, breathing, color change).\nI can help you decide the next step while you’re waiting to speak to her doctor.",

    "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
    "answer": "What you’re describing—left arm/shoulder giving out quickly, tremor with effort, and asymmetry—fits well with a mild residual hemiparesis from your prior right‑sided brain surgery. That type of weakness can be subtle in day‑to‑day life yet show up with higher‑demand tasks like weightlifting. After central nervous system injury, the affected side often has:\n- Reduced motor unit recruitment and coordination\n- Early “central” fatigue (strength drops off after a few reps)\n- Effort tremor and poor shoulder/scapular control\n\nOther contributors to rule out: a shoulder/peripheral nerve issue (rotator cuff, long thoracic nerve/scapular winging), and less likely medication effects (usually bilateral). It’s reasonable that your neurologist linked this to surgery; hemiparesis doesn’t have to be obvious at rest to be real.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Ask for a referral to PM&R (physiatry) and neuro-physical/occupational therapy. They can quantify the deficit and build a targeted program.\n- Useful assessments: detailed neuro exam (tone, reflexes, pronator drift, coordination), shoulder/scapular mechanics, grip strength, and possibly EMG/NCS if peripheral nerve injury is suspected. If the weakness has progressed or is new, your neurologist may consider updated brain imaging.\n- If you have shoulder pain, visible scapular winging, or instability, a focused shoulder evaluation is important too.\n\nTraining and rehab strategies that help\n- Safety first:\n  - Avoid breath‑holding/straining (Valsalva); exhale through effort. Train with a spotter or machines. Keep good hydration and sleep; both matter for seizure control.\n- How to load the left arm:\n  - Start lighter than you think—bands, 1–2 lb dumbbells, or even assisted movement. The goal is clean reps without form collapse or severe tremor.\n  - Use unilateral work and begin each session with the left side. Stop a set when form deteriorates, not when you “can’t move it.”\n  - Favor machines/cables and supported positions early (e.g., chest‑supported row, cable curls, landmine press) so the shoulder is more stable than with free weights overhead.\n  - Eccentric/assisted reps: use both arms to lift the weight and the left arm to lower slowly (3–5 seconds). Or help the left with the right during the concentric.\n  - Isometrics: hold positions at multiple joint angles (e.g., 5–10 second holds for curls, presses, external rotation). These build neural drive with less fatigue.\n  - Cluster sets: break 8–12 total reps into mini‑sets of 2–3 with 15–20 seconds between mini‑sets to reduce early fatigue.\n  - Longer rests (2–3 minutes) between sets for the left arm.\n  - Prioritize scapular control and rotator‑cuff endurance: serratus punches, wall slides, prone Y/T/Ws, external rotations with a band, scapular retraction/depression drills.\n- Neuro‑rehab adjuncts (ask PT/OT about):\n  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to deltoid/biceps/forearm during exercise to improve activation.\n  - Mirror therapy and mental practice/imagery.\n  - Constraint‑induced movement training principles for daily tasks to reduce “learned non‑use.”\n- Frequency and expectations:\n  - 3–4 days/week short sessions for the left arm; small, steady progress is the goal. Improvements are possible even years later, but they’re gradual.\n- Practical tips:\n  - Do the left side first, then match the right to the left’s volume to avoid widening the asymmetry.\n  - If grip limits curls/rows, consider a light strap temporarily so the biceps/shoulder can be trained without forearm giving out.\n  - If overhead pressing collapses, regress to incline/landmine presses before true overhead.\n\nWhen to seek re‑evaluation sooner\n- Rapidly worsening weakness, new numbness, new/worse headaches, vision or speech changes, or a change in seizure pattern.\n\nA few quick questions that can help tailor this:\n- Do you notice scapular winging or shoulder blade “popping out” on the left during wall push‑ups?\n- Any shoulder pain or history of dislocations?\n- Do fine motor tasks (buttons, handwriting) on the left fatigue faster too?\n- Which anti‑seizure medication are you on, and has the weakness changed with med changes?\n\nBottom line: Mild hemiparesis from your prior right‑sided surgery is a likely explanation. A PM&R and neuro‑PT/OT program, plus smart programming (assisted/eccentric work, isometrics, scapular stabilization, NMES), can meaningfully improve strength and control over time.",

    "question": "After standing from a prolonged period of sitting (especially when looking at a screen) I have 'episodes' which include spasms and staring. These occur multiple times a day, and I have had an ambulatory eeg. This has been happening for the last 4 years approximatelyThese came back to show that I don't have epilepsy, however my brain waves slow down and they suspect that I have mild cerebal hypoxia.My question is how bad is mild cerebal hypoxia because when severe, it can be very serious. Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",
    "answer": "Short answer: what your EEG likely showed is brief, reversible slowing from reduced blood flow to the brain when you stand (orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion), not a seizure. Brief “mild” episodes like this are usually not dangerous to brain cells and aren’t known to cause cumulative brain damage, but the frequency matters because it signals a treatable circulation/autonomic issue and increases risk of falls and injuries. It deserves evaluation and active management.\n\nWhy this happens\n- When you stand, blood pools in the legs/abdomen. Your body should raise heart rate and tighten blood vessels to keep brain blood flow stable.\n- If that compensation is weak or delayed, brain blood flow drops for seconds to minutes. EEG often shows generalized slowing during symptoms. People can stare, feel foggy, have visual dimming/tunnel vision, and may have brief jerks (“convulsive syncope”) without epilepsy.\n- Common causes at your age: orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), neurally mediated/vasovagal syncope, dehydration, and glucose disturbances. Diabetes can add risk (dehydration with high sugars; rarely, early autonomic neuropathy).\n\nHow worried to be\n- Brief, self-limited drops in cerebral perfusion are uncomfortable but not the same as prolonged severe hypoxia from lung or cardiac failure. They generally don’t cause lasting brain injury.\n- Do take it seriously: frequent episodes mean your orthostatic tolerance is poor and the underlying cause should be found and treated. The main near-term risks are falls, reduced function, and impaired concentration.\n\nThings you can do now while waiting\n1) Measure orthostatic vitals at home (ideally with someone present)\n- Rest lying down 5 minutes, record BP/HR.\n- Stand; record at 1, 3, and 10 minutes, and note symptoms.\n- Concerning patterns:\n  - Orthostatic hypotension: BP drops ≥20 systolic or ≥10 diastolic within 3 minutes.\n  - POTS: in people 12–19 years, HR rises ≥40 bpm (without a big BP drop) within 10 minutes plus chronic orthostatic symptoms.\n\n2) Check glucose during symptoms\n- In type 1 diabetes, hypoglycemia can cause staring, jerks, and confusion; hyperglycemia can worsen dehydration. If you have CGM, mark events and review.\n\n3) Hydration, salt, and daily habits\n- Fluids: target about 2–3 liters/day unless your clinician has told you otherwise.\n- Salt: many with orthostatic intolerance feel better with more salt (often 6–10 g/day), unless you have hypertension or kidney issues. Discuss with your clinician; consider starting with salting food and electrolyte solutions.\n- Compression: waist-high 20–30 mmHg stockings and/or an abdominal binder reduce blood pooling.\n- Position changes: stand up slowly; after sitting long and especially after screen time, do a minute of ankle pumps, calf raises, or march in place before walking.\n- Counter-pressure maneuvers at first sign of symptoms: leg crossing with muscle tensing, handgrip, buttock/calf squeezing.\n- Avoid triggers: prolonged standing, hot showers, large high-carb meals, dehydration, alcohol.\n- Exercise reconditioning: start with recumbent bike/rowing/swimming, aiming for 30–45 minutes most days; add leg/core strengthening. This can markedly improve symptoms over weeks.\n\n4) Keep a brief diary\n- Note time, trigger (standing after sitting/screen), symptoms, BP/HR, and glucose. If possible, capture a phone video of an episode—very helpful for clinicians.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Fainting during exercise, chest pain, sustained palpitations, shortness of breath, blue/gray color, prolonged loss of consciousness (>1–2 minutes), new focal neurologic deficits, or injury from a fall.\n- Family history of sudden cardiac death or known structural heart disease.\n\nWhat to ask your doctors\n- Cardiology/autonomic testing: 12‑lead ECG, ambulatory rhythm monitor, orthostatic vitals in clinic, tilt-table test; echocardiogram if indicated.\n- Autonomic reflex testing if available.\n- Lab review: iron/ferritin, B12, thyroid, morning cortisol if symptoms suggest; review diabetes control and hydration status.\n- Medication/substance review (stimulants, cannabis, antidepressants, antihypertensives can worsen orthostasis).\n- Treatment options if non‑drug measures aren’t enough: fludrocortisone, midodrine, beta‑blocker/ivabradine, pyridostigmine, etc. (only with clinician guidance).\n\nNotes specific to your diabetes\n- Keep glucose in target and avoid dehydration; high sugars drive fluid loss and worsen orthostasis.\n- Always check for hypoglycemia during/just before symptoms; treat lows promptly.\n- Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can cause orthostatic hypotension, though it’s less common at your age—still worth considering if symptoms persist.\n\nBottom line\n- Your description and EEG fit transient orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion rather than epilepsy.\n- It is unlikely to cause brain damage when brief, but the frequency means it should be addressed. The strategies above often help substantially, and formal evaluation can pinpoint the cause and guide specific therapy. If any red flags occur, seek urgent care.",

    "question": "Currently on no medications, BW is normal other than some minor indication of anemia and malnourishment (low folate, hemotacrit, hemoglobin, vitamin d, sodium) high albumin.Family history of a wide variety of mental health conditions as well as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycistic kidneys.Began approximately 4 years ago. Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i’m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn’t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs. Also have had gastrointestinal issues which i’m not sure if they are relevant or not: nausea and stomach pain after eating anything. Have had some issues with UTI’s. All doctors I have visited have told me there is nothing wrong and make me feel as if they just believe i’m looking for free pills(or a hypochrondiac) but I am still having these issues so i’m not sure where to go from here. pls help",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’ve been going through this and not getting answers. What you describe is real and deserves a careful, coordinated work‑up. A “normal” MRI/EEG does not rule out important causes of convulsions, fainting, tics, and sensory symptoms.\n\nWhat your symptoms could fit\n- Epileptic seizures (including photosensitive generalized epilepsy): flashing police lights and emergence from anesthesia are classic triggers; routine EEGs can be normal between events.\n- Convulsive syncope and/or dysautonomia (POTS/orthostatic intolerance): prior fainting spells, fatigue, brain fog; syncope can include brief jerks that look like seizures.\n- Migraine variants (brainstem aura, hemiplegic migraine) that cause tingling, weakness, and can sometimes overlap with seizures.\n- Functional neurological disorder/psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and functional tics: common, real, and treatable; can coexist with epilepsy or POTS.\n- Nutritional/malabsorption issues (possible celiac or other GI disorder): low folate, vitamin D, anemia, GI pain after eating can cause neuropathy, weakness, and lower seizure threshold.\n- Metabolic/electrolyte contributors: low sodium and sleep deprivation/substances all lower seizure threshold.\n- Less common: demyelinating disease, thyroid/autoimmune encephalopathy, Wilson disease (depending on age and exam).\n\nWhy prior tests may have been “normal”\n- Routine EEG (20–40 minutes) misses many epilepsies; sensitivity improves markedly with prolonged video‑EEG monitoring or ambulatory EEG, especially if an event is captured.\n- MRIs need an epilepsy protocol to pick up subtle lesions. Many people with genetic generalized epilepsy have a normal MRI.\n\nWhat to do next (prioritized)\n1) Safety now\n- Until cleared: do not drive; avoid swimming alone, heights, operating heavy machinery; take showers instead of baths.\n- Learn seizure first aid; if a convulsion lasts >5 minutes or clusters occur without full recovery, seek emergency care.\n\n2) Get to the right specialists\n- Comprehensive epilepsy center (Level 3–4): ask for prolonged video‑EEG monitoring to capture an event and evaluate photosensitivity; repeat brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (with/without contrast).\n- Autonomic clinic or cardiology with interest in dysautonomia: orthostatic vitals and tilt‑table test for POTS/orthostatic hypotension (given prior fainting, fatigue).\n- Movement‑disorders neurologist or neuro‑ot/psychiatry familiar with functional tics if tics persist and are disabling.\n- Gastroenterology for malabsorption/ceIiac work‑up and your post‑meal pain/nausea.\n\n3) Targeted labs to discuss with your doctor\n- Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), folate (confirm low), vitamin B12 and MMA, vitamin D, magnesium.\n- Repeat sodium with serum osmolality; urine sodium/osmolality to evaluate cause of hyponatremia.\n- Thyroid panel (TSH, free T4); morning cortisol if symptoms suggest.\n- Celiac panel: tissue transglutaminase IgA with total IgA; consider deamidated gliadin IgG if IgA low.\n- Inflammation and nutrition: CMP, CBC with indices, CRP/ESR; consider copper/ceruloplasmin if movement disorder prominent.\n- If demyelination is suspected clinically, neurologist may add spinal MRI and CSF studies.\n\n4) Address modifiable triggers\n- Substances: alcohol binges/withdrawal, cocaine/MDMA/meth, high‑THC cannabis, tramadol, bupropion, diphenhydramine, sleep deprivation, and fasting all increase seizure risk and can worsen tics/migraines. Strictly avoid until evaluated.\n- Photosensitivity: minimize exposure to flashing/strobe lights; reduce screen brightness, use high‑refresh‑rate screens, consider blue/rose‑tinted lenses (e.g., Z1 lenses), look away/cover one eye if exposed unexpectedly.\n- Sleep: aim for consistent 7.5–9 hours; treat any sleep disorder.\n- Nutrition/hydration: replete deficiencies (iron, folate, B12 if low, vitamin D) under medical guidance; balanced meals with protein and complex carbs; adequate fluids and electrolytes. If orthostatic symptoms, your doctor may advise increased fluids/salt and compression stockings.\n\n5) Track your events\n- Keep a detailed diary: date/time, what you were doing, triggers (lights, posture change, meals, substances), aura/sensation, duration, recovery, injuries, tongue biting, incontinence.\n- Ask someone to video an event safely. This is incredibly helpful for diagnosis.\n\n6) Be prepared for two things to be true\n- It’s possible to have epilepsy and also orthostatic intolerance or functional symptoms; teasing them apart guides the right treatments.\n- If PNES/functional tics are diagnosed, they are genuine brain‑body disorders and respond to targeted therapies (CBT with a clinician trained in FND, physical/occupational therapy with graded exposure, and habit‑reversal therapy for tics).\n\nWhen to go to the ER\n- A convulsive event >5 minutes; repeated seizures without full recovery; new focal weakness or trouble speaking that doesn’t resolve; severe head injury during a spell; fever/stiff neck with confusion.\n\nHow to advocate with clinicians\n- Bring a one‑page summary of your timeline, abnormal labs (with dates/values), and the above ask: “Please refer me to a Comprehensive Epilepsy Center for prolonged video‑EEG and to Autonomics for tilt‑table testing. I’d also like a celiac/malabsorption work‑up for my deficiencies and GI symptoms.” Bring a witness who has seen an event and your event videos.\n\nA few questions to help tailor next steps\n- Your age and any current medications/supplements?\n- Which substances were involved when events occurred (alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, others), and was it during use or withdrawal?\n- Any tongue biting (especially side of tongue), loss of bladder control, or prolonged confusion after events?\n- Do episodes cluster around menstruation (if applicable)?\n- Do symptoms worsen when standing and improve when lying down?\n- Any weight loss or rashes/mouth ulcers/diarrhea that might point to celiac or other GI disease?\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a concise referral note you can take to your doctor and help prioritize labs and appointments in your area, including finding a Level 3–4 epilepsy center and an autonomic clinic.",

    "question": "Hi all, I don’t know if Im looking in the right place but wanted to get some advice I have these “fits” where for about 10 seconds I can’t control my left side of my body or speak, it usually cause my arm to go up in the air, and my face to scrunch up, I am fully conscious and aware of what is happening during these episodes but I can’t control them, I am able to tell when I am about to have one, they normally happen when I stand up to fast, and jumped unexpectedly, or when I’m very nervous, I have had an EEG and an MRI scan about 4 years ago nothing showed up and no epilepsy was diagnosed either. I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—what you describe is understandably distressing, and you deserve a clear plan.\n\nBased on the brief, stereotyped (≈10 seconds), unilateral movements with facial pulling and arm elevation, preserved awareness, speech arrest, and predictable triggers (standing quickly, startle, nervousness), the main possibilities to discuss with a neurologist are:\n- Reflex focal aware seizures (startle- or movement/kinesigenic-triggered): brief, stereotyped, often with speech arrest and asymmetric tonic posturing; interictal EEG and even MRI can be normal. Capturing an event on video-EEG is key.\n- Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD): very brief attacks of dystonia/chorea/abnormal posturing triggered by sudden movement or startle, with intact awareness; EEG/MRI typically normal. Often responds dramatically to low-dose carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.\n- Functional neurological disorder (FND), including functional seizures/movement disorder: episodes are often triggered by stress/anxiety and may look seizure-like but aren’t due to abnormal electrical activity; best diagnosed with video-EEG and treated with targeted physiotherapy and psychological therapies.\n- Less likely but worth excluding based on history/exam: hemifacial spasm (wouldn’t explain arm), cataplexy (usually loss of tone, not posturing), orthostatic causes (POTS/orthostatic hypotension; could be a trigger but doesn’t usually cause unilateral dystonia), metabolic issues (electrolytes), or very rarely startle disease.\n\nWhy your prior tests may have been “normal”: A routine EEG and an MRI done years ago can be normal in focal epilepsy or PKD. The gold standard is capturing a typical event on video-EEG. If your symptoms have persisted or changed, re-evaluation is appropriate.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) Ask for referral to a neurologist who sees both epilepsy and movement disorders, or an epilepsy monitoring unit.\n   - Request prolonged video-EEG monitoring to capture a typical spell.\n   - Consider a sleep‑deprived EEG or ambulatory EEG if inpatient monitoring isn’t available.\n   - If it’s been years or symptoms have changed, consider a repeat brain MRI with epilepsy protocol.\n\n2) Evaluate triggers and mimics:\n   - Orthostatic vitals or a tilt‑table test if standing up fast reliably triggers episodes.\n   - Blood tests: glucose, electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium), thyroid function, B12/folate.\n\n3) Bring data:\n   - Try to record a phone video of an episode (start filming when you sense one coming), capturing your face, arm, posture, and speech attempts.\n   - Keep a diary noting date/time, trigger (startle/standing/stress), position (lying/sitting/standing), exact duration, side involved, whether you could speak, and how you felt after.\n\n4) Safety until you’re assessed:\n   - Stand up slowly; hydrate well; consider calf-pumping or leg-crossing before standing.\n   - Avoid heights, swimming alone, operating machinery, and check your local rules about driving with unexplained spells causing loss of motor control.\n   - Manage stress/sleep; limit alcohol and recreational drugs.\n\n5) Potential treatments once a diagnosis is made:\n   - Reflex focal seizures: antiseizure meds (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine, clobazam) tailored by a neurologist.\n   - PKD: low-dose carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine often works within days; acetazolamide is another option.\n   - FND: physiotherapy with motor retraining plus psychological therapies (e.g., CBT) and education about FND.\n\nSeek urgent care if:\n- An episode lasts longer than 5 minutes or you have repeated episodes without recovery,\n- You develop new persistent weakness, severe headache, fever, head injury, confusion, or fainting,\n- You’re pregnant or on blood thinners and have a significant event.\n\nIf you’re willing, a few details can help narrow things:\n- How old were you when this started, and how often do episodes occur now?\n- Any post-episode fatigue, confusion, or muscle soreness?\n- Any tongue biting, falls, or incontinence?\n- Family history of epilepsy or movement disorders?\n- Any head injury, stroke, or new medications/supplements?\n\nYou’re not at a dead end—many people with similar brief, triggered events get answers when a typical spell is recorded on video-EEG. Bringing a good video and diary to a specialist often speeds diagnosis and treatment.",

    "question": "[21M] epileptic from quemotherapy, and 5 years cancer free.Is there a variation that could allow me to safely take them? For instance \"lf you have X specific kind of epilepsy, or if you aren't taking X medication you can take them\" Does the dose matter? I have read people say that would have seizures when microdosing but not when doing high doses. How does that work? Thank you so much!",
    "answer": "First, congrats on being 5 years cancer‑free. I’m sorry you’re dealing with epilepsy on top of that.\n\nKey point: there isn’t good evidence that any psychedelic or “microdose” is reliably safe for people with epilepsy. Most clinical trials exclude anyone with a seizure history, so we don’t have solid data. If you have epilepsy—especially acquired (e.g., after chemo/brain injury)—the safest default is to avoid these substances outside of a medical/research setting.\n\nIt would help to know exactly what you mean by “them” (psilocybin/LSD, MDMA, ketamine, cannabis, something else?) and:\n- What kind of seizures you have (focal vs generalized), how well-controlled they are, and your last seizure\n- Your current meds (including antidepressants, stimulants, pain meds, and supplements)\n\nGeneral guidance by category (high-level, not medical advice):\n- Classic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, DMT, mescaline): Unknown seizure risk in epilepsy; case reports of seizures exist. Strongly avoid if you take lithium (well‑documented dangerous combo, seizures even at “microdoses”). Caution with bupropion, tramadol, tricyclics, antipsychotics (all lower seizure threshold).\n- MDMA: Raises seizure risk via overheating, hyponatremia, sleep deprivation, stimulant effects. Interacts with SSRIs/SNRIs (serotonin syndrome risk), and with many meds.\n- Ketamine: Not classically pro‑convulsant and is used medically, but recreational use still carries risks (polysubstance use, blood pressure spikes, sleep loss).\n- Cannabis: THC can lower seizure threshold in some; CBD can be anticonvulsant but interacts with some antiseizure meds (e.g., clobazam) and dosing/purity are issues.\n- Alcohol: Withdrawal is a major seizure trigger; binge/withdrawal cycles are risky.\n\nAbout dose and the “microdosing vs high dose” claim:\n- There’s no evidence that high doses are safer. Generally, higher dose = higher physiological stress and potential risk.\n- Why some report seizures on microdoses but not big doses:\n  - Microdosing is often frequent and can disturb sleep/anxiety—both lower seizure threshold.\n  - Dose miscalculation/variation (especially with LSD) is common.\n  - High-dose use tends to be rare and sometimes in controlled settings with support, hydration, and planning—microdosing is often mixed with work stress, caffeine, and poor sleep.\n  - Anecdotes suffer from bias; they shouldn’t guide safety decisions.\n\nSituations that make use especially risky:\n- Any seizure in the last 6–12 months or not fully controlled\n- History of status epilepticus\n- Taking lithium, bupropion, tramadol, clozapine, TCAs, MAOIs, or heavy alcohol use\n- Sleep deprivation, dehydration, overheating, recent illness, electrolyte issues\n\nIf you are determined to pursue this, please speak with your neurologist first. Ask about:\n- Your personal seizure risk and triggers\n- Medication interactions (bring a full list)\n- An emergency plan and rescue med (e.g., prescribed benzodiazepine) and when to use it\n- Whether there are any legitimate, supervised research options for your condition\n\nHarm-reduction basics if your doctor clears you (not an endorsement):\n- Do not stop or skip antiseizure meds\n- Avoid lithium, bupropion, tramadol, MAOIs, alcohol, and other stimulants\n- Prioritize sleep, hydration, electrolytes; avoid overheating\n- Have a trusted, sober person present who can call emergency services\n- One substance at a time; avoid polydrug use; start low and never redose rapidly\n- Choose a calm environment; avoid flashing lights\n\nIf you can, please tell me:\n- Which substance(s) you’re asking about\n- Your seizure type, control status, last seizure\n- Your current meds\n\nI can give more tailored, safety‑focused information based on that.",

    "question": "Hey, so I am male, early 30s, white. Currently taking : Lamictal 400mg Fluoxetine 10mg Omeprazole 40mg Gabapentin 300mg 3x day as needed Vitamin D DX : Bipolar type 2 Social phobia (not sure exactly how my psych phrased it) Anxiety Abdominal epilepsy Acid reflux Tobacco (on/off), marijuana use, almost never drink or use any other drugs. I will do my best to be brief. I have had serious mental health issues since I was a child. First suicide attempt was at 7. Institutionalized at 15 for suicidal ideation, and have had therapy since then. I restarted medications at 21. I have had a lot of bad experiences with medical professionals. Very abusive docs when institutionalized. My last doctor told me to treat my bipolar disorder with a multivitamin. The doctor before prescribed me an anti depressant, had a manic episode, then changed to lamictal 100mg. He also called me a drug seeker because I wanted muscle relaxers to treat a weird medical episode that was causing severe neck pain. This turned out to be abdominal epilepsy. I have used urgent cares on rare occasion to get antibiotics, etc. But I haven't had a pcp since I was 20. How can I find a PCP that is comfortable working with mental health patients? What do I need to have done to get on track? I am aware that I am extremely high risk for suicide, between bipolar, loss of a sibling to suicide, childhood sexual abuse. I feel it's more important than ever to get a grip on my physical health so I can have a long life with my wife and my parents, and live to take care of them in their golden years. Currently see a therapist and a psych for med management. I'm also working with my therapist now to work through my problems with seeking medical care. Any other questions I am happy to ask.",
    "answer": "First, I’m really sorry for what you’ve been through. The way you’re advocating for yourself now—sticking with therapy, working with a psychiatrist, and wanting a PCP you can trust—is a big deal. You deserve trauma‑informed, respectful care.\n\nHow to find a PCP who’s good with mental health\n- Where to look\n  - Your therapist/psychiatrist: ask for 2–3 PCPs they trust and already coordinate with.\n  - Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and academic medical centers: many use “integrated behavioral health” or “collaborative care” models, where PCPs work closely with therapists/psychiatry.\n  - Your insurance directory: filter for “behavioral health integration,” “trauma‑informed,” or check bios for interests in mental health, addiction, LGBTQ+ care, complex chronic care.\n  - Local NAMI or DBSA chapters: they often know PCPs who are MH‑friendly.\n  - If feasible, consider Direct Primary Care (DPC)/concierge practices; longer visits and coordination are common.\n- What to ask before booking (a quick call or portal message)\n  - “Does your clinic use integrated/embedded behavioral health or the collaborative care model?”\n  - “Are your PCPs comfortable caring for patients with bipolar disorder and anxiety who also see a psychiatrist?”\n  - “Will you coordinate with my therapist/psychiatrist if I sign a release?”\n  - “What’s your approach to long‑term PPI use, seizure disorders, and nonjudgmental discussions about tobacco/cannabis?”\n  - “Can I schedule a longer new‑patient visit? I have a trauma history and a complex med list.”\n- Green flags\n  - Willingness to coordinate care, longer first visit slots, clear communication policies, nonjudgmental language in bios/reviews, and clinics that mention “trauma‑informed” or “integrated behavioral health.”\n\nHow to prepare so the first visit goes smoothly\n- Make a 1‑page health summary to bring or upload:\n  - Diagnoses: bipolar II, social anxiety, abdominal epilepsy, GERD.\n  - Meds with doses and who prescribes each: Lamotrigine 400 mg; Fluoxetine 10 mg; Omeprazole 40 mg; Gabapentin 300 mg up to TID PRN; Vitamin D.\n  - Past med reactions: e.g., antidepressant‑induced mania/hypomania.\n  - Allergies/intolerances.\n  - Key history: hospitalizations (with year), suicide attempt history (brief dates only), seizure workup (EEG/MRI if done), any GI tests.\n  - Contacts: therapist and psychiatrist, plus releases to share info.\n  - Your goals: “Stable mood, seizure control, step‑down PPI if safe, quit tobacco, preventive care.”\n- Ask for small accommodations\n  - Longer first visit, step‑by‑step consent during exams, option to bring a support person, and clear follow‑up plan.\n\nWhat to get done to “get on track” (first 3–6 months)\n- Care coordination\n  - Sign releases so your PCP, psychiatrist, and therapist can share info.\n  - Create a brief safety plan in your chart (you can reuse your therapy plan).\n- Preventive care (typical for men in early 30s; tailor to you)\n  - Vaccines: Tdap booster if >10 years, annual flu, updated COVID, HPV (catch‑up to 45), Hep B (recommended for adults ≤59), others by risk.\n  - Screening labs: blood pressure, BMI/waist, fasting lipids, A1c if overweight or other risk, CMP/CBC, hepatitis C (once for all adults), HIV (at least once), STI per risk. Consider TSH once given mood/anxiety history.\n  - Lifestyle: sleep, exercise plan, nutrition, dental and eye care, skin self‑checks.\n- Condition‑specific items\n  - Bipolar II: PCP should defer mood med changes to psychiatry but screen for side effects and interactions. Ensure all prescribers know about prior antidepressant‑induced mania/hypomania.\n  - Abdominal epilepsy: ensure diagnosis and records are in the chart; consider neurology follow‑up if not recent. Confirm seizure precautions and state driving rules if applicable.\n  - GERD/omeprazole 40 mg: discuss step‑down if possible (timed dosing, diet/sleep changes, H. pylori testing if indicated). If long‑term PPI is needed, consider periodic checks for B12, magnesium, kidney function per your PCP’s judgment.\n  - Gabapentin PRN: review effectiveness, sedation, and renal function; ideally have one prescriber managing it.\n  - Tobacco/cannabis: make a quit/reduction plan you feel good about; options include NRT or varenicline (generally safe with mood disorders but monitor with your psych). For cannabis, discuss how it affects mood/anxiety and reflux.\n- Monitoring and tools\n  - Simple trackers: PHQ‑9/GAD‑7 monthly, mood chart, seizure diary, reflux triggers. Bring snapshots to visits.\n\nTrauma‑informed tips for appointments\n- Say up front: “I’ve had medical trauma. It helps when you explain each step and check in before touching.”\n- You can pause or decline any exam. You can bring someone with you. You can ask for notes to be shared via the portal after each visit.\n\nQuick medication/interaction notes to discuss with your clinicians\n- Lamotrigine 400 mg is within seizure‑treatment ranges; watch for dizziness/rash; ensure all prescribers avoid interacting meds (e.g., valproate increases lamotrigine; enzyme inducers decrease it).\n- Fluoxetine 10 mg: low dose; monitor for hypomania. SSRIs can rarely cause low sodium—report new confusion, headaches, or falls.\n- Omeprazole long‑term: revisit need yearly; consider lifestyle measures and step‑down if symptoms allow.\n- Gabapentin: check kidney function; watch for sedation/imbalance and interactions with other sedatives.\n\nA gentle safety check-in\n- You’ve been very open about risk factors. If you’re having thoughts of harming yourself now or feel unsafe, please reach out to your therapist/psychiatrist, a trusted person, or call/text 988 (US) or go to the nearest ER. If you’re outside the US, tell me your country and I can help find the right number.\n\nIf you’d like, I can:\n- Help you draft a short message or call script to screen PCP offices.\n- Build a 1‑page health summary template you can fill in.\n- Suggest specific clinics if you share your city/ZIP and insurance.",

    "question": "My bf is a 33M, 220 lbs, history of epilepsy, high cholesterol, has high blood pressure on occasion, ADD, allergy to augmentin, and kiwi. He takes lamotrigine, phenobarbital, Lamictal. He vapes, never drinks, and smokes marijuana on occasion. He hasn't had a seizure in three years fortunately. He went to the Dr yesterday and his Dr told him his med levels are at a level 2 when they should be at around a 7. Dr showed him that the levels dropped to dangerous levels in three years despite an increase in meds in those years. Any insight in what this could be? He's waiting on more blood tests.",
    "answer": "Short answer: the most common reasons antiseizure “drug levels” fall over time are enzyme‑inducing drug interactions, changes in adherence or timing, smoking exposure, and when/How the blood was drawn. Based on what you wrote, a drug–drug interaction is very plausible.\n\nWhat “level 2 vs 7” likely means\n- That sounds like a lamotrigine (Lamictal) blood level around 2 mcg/mL, with a target closer to ~7 mcg/mL. Typical lamotrigine reference ranges are roughly 3–15 mcg/mL, but the right target is individualized.\n- Phenobarbital levels use different numbers (therapeutic ~15–40 mcg/mL).\n\nKey reasons levels can drop despite dose increases\n- Phenobarbital effect: Phenobarbital is a strong liver‑enzyme inducer and can lower lamotrigine levels by 40–60% (and shorten its half‑life). If his phenobarbital dose went up over time, lamotrigine can fall unless it’s adjusted accordingly.\n- Smoking exposure: Combustion smoke (tobacco or marijuana) induces enzymes and can lower lamotrigine a bit. Vaping nicotine alone is less likely to do this, but marijuana smoke can contribute if used regularly.\n- Missed or inconsistent doses: The most common cause of low levels. ADD can make adherence harder—pillbox/alarms help.\n- Blood draw timing: Levels should be a “trough” (right before the next dose) after at least 4–5 days on a stable dose. If the sample was taken many hours later than usual, after a missed dose, or not as a trough, it can read low.\n- Generic/brand or formulation changes: Switching between manufacturers or between immediate‑release and XR can shift levels.\n- New meds/supplements: Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, St. John’s wort, and estrogen (OCPs/HRT) lower lamotrigine. CBD products can sometimes raise levels; THC smoke may lower indirectly. Statins, common BP meds, and stimulants for ADD typically don’t affect lamotrigine much.\n- GI issues or major weight change can modestly influence levels.\n\nA few important clarifications to check now\n- Which drug level was “2”? Lamotrigine or phenobarbital?\n- Exactly when was blood drawn relative to his last dose(s)?\n- Any recent changes in: phenobarbital dose, smoking/marijuana frequency, pharmacy/manufacturer, switching to XR, new meds or supplements?\n- Note: lamotrigine and Lamictal are the same medicine—just be sure you’re not double‑counting names when listing meds.\n\nWhat to do while waiting for labs\n- Don’t change doses without his prescriber’s guidance.\n- Take meds at the exact same times daily; set reminders/pillbox.\n- Until levels are rechecked and plan set, consider extra seizure‑safety precautions (avoid climbing heights, swimming alone, operating heavy machinery/driving if he feels auras or has missed doses).\n- Keep habits consistent (smoking/vaping/cannabis, caffeine, sleep) so the recheck is comparable.\n\nGood questions to ask his doctor\n- Can we confirm the level was a true trough? If not, repeat a trough level.\n- Are his phenobarbital levels therapeutic? Do we need to adjust phenobarbital or consider a non‑inducing alternative to stabilize lamotrigine?\n- Would XR lamotrigine or split dosing help smooth levels?\n- Any interactions with his current meds or supplements?\n- What’s the individualized therapeutic range for him, given he’s been seizure‑free?\n\nBottom line: With phenobarbital on board, low lamotrigine levels are common and often require higher lamotrigine doses or rethinking the regimen. Adherence and sample timing are also frequent culprits. His team is doing the right thing by repeating labs and tracking trends—share the details above so they can pinpoint the cause. If he has any warning signs (auras, myoclonic jerks, missed doses, new neurologic symptoms), contact the clinic promptly.",

    "question": "Age: 21 Sex: Female (But I go by He/Him) Height: 5'3 Weight: 106lbsOver the past few months I've been seeing a psychiatrist and she's put me on numerous pills. The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been. And every now and then I'm seeing things like a weird grey cloud with a face in my bedroom or I'll think my hands are turning grey when they aren't.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you describe is serious and deserves prompt attention.\n\nIf you feel you might act on suicidal thoughts, or you have a plan or intent:\n- Call or text 988 (US) or go to the nearest ER now.\n- If you’re outside the US, use your local emergency number or suicide hotline.\n- Stay with someone you trust and remove access to anything you could use to harm yourself.\n\nWhat may be going on\n- Cannabis can trigger severe panic and even short‑term psychotic symptoms, especially with high‑THC products or edibles. This risk is higher when combined with activating antidepressants like bupropion and venlafaxine.\n- Since tapering venlafaxine, you could also be having discontinuation symptoms: body aches, fatigue, anxiety, “not myself,” and even visual disturbances.\n- Oxcarbazepine can cause fatigue and low sodium, which can worsen confusion and mood.\n- Bupropion + venlafaxine together can heighten anxiety; bupropion also strongly inhibits CYP2D6, which can raise venlafaxine levels.\n- Hydroxyzine + ondansetron together can affect heart rhythm in some people.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) Safety and substances\n- Do not use cannabis again, and avoid alcohol until you’re stable.\n- If hallucinations, confusion, fever, stiff muscles, or very fast heart rate occur, go to urgent care/ER.\n\n2) Call your prescriber promptly (ask for an urgent visit) and discuss:\n- The severe reaction to cannabis and the ongoing hallucinations and suicidal thoughts.\n- Slowing the venlafaxine taper (or temporarily adjusting) if this is withdrawal.\n- Whether your current combo (bupropion + venlafaxine + hydroxyzine + ondansetron + oxcarbazepine) is appropriate for you, or if simplifying the regimen is safer.\n- Checking a basic lab panel, especially sodium (for oxcarbazepine), TSH, CBC, CMP, B12, vitamin D, and ferritin to look for causes of fatigue/pain.\n- Any heart symptoms; ask whether to avoid taking hydroxyzine and ondansetron close together.\n\n3) Monitoring and self‑care while you wait\n- Keep a simple daily log of meds, doses, sleep, anxiety/panic, hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, heart rate, and blood pressure if you can.\n- Hydrate, eat regularly, and aim for gentle movement/stretching. For body aches, acetaminophen is generally safer than NSAIDs with SNRIs (use any pain reliever only as directed).\n- Use grounding when anxious or seeing things: slow breathing (inhale 4 sec, exhale 6–8 sec), 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 senses, hold ice/cold water splash, focus on firm touch/pressure points.\n- Do not stop any prescribed med abruptly unless your clinician tells you to.\n\n4) Advocacy and support\n- If you don’t feel heard, ask for a same‑week second opinion (another psychiatrist) or involve your primary care clinician.\n- Consider therapy if you’re not in it already; CBT/DBT can help with panic and suicidal thoughts.\n- Let a trusted person know what’s going on and ask them to check in regularly.\n\nImportant notes to raise with your clinician\n- Your reaction started right after cannabis, but symptoms are persisting and include hallucinations and increased suicidality.\n- Oxcarbazepine can lower sodium; request a sodium check within 1–2 weeks of starting and if you feel worse.\n- Bupropion lowers seizure threshold (be cautious if you’re underweight or missing meals).\n- Oxcarbazepine reduces the effectiveness of hormonal birth control; use backup contraception if relevant.\n\nIf you’re willing, please share:\n- What form of cannabis you used (smoked, vaped, edible) and approximate THC dose.\n- Whether the hallucinations are daily and whether you’re sleeping/eating normally.\n- Any family history of bipolar disorder or psychosis.\n\nYou’re not alone in this, and these reactions can be treated. Your safety comes first—please reach out urgently if your suicidal thoughts are strong or you feel out of control.",

    "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",
    "answer": "Thanks for laying this out so clearly. You’re not overthinking it—what you’re describing is worth a proper work‑up, and you’ve already done the right thing by booking an appointment.\n\nWhat your symptoms suggest\n- Brief, stereotyped sensory episodes: Pleasant smells/tastes that last seconds, sudden euphoria, and brief dissociation are classic for focal aware seizures from the temporal/insular regions. “Ecstatic” seizures and olfactory/gustatory auras are uncommon but well‑described in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The very short duration (seconds to a minute or two) and stereotyped nature fit seizures better than migraine aura (migraine aura usually lasts 5–60 minutes; olfactory/gustatory aura is rare in migraine).\n- Sleep phenomena: The “locked‑in” episodes with buzzing, occurring when falling asleep or waking, strongly match sleep paralysis with hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. Sleep deprivation makes these much more likely. The head‑jerk and hitting the wall could be a sleep jerk (hypnic myoclonus) or another parasomnia; however, nocturnal seizures can also cause injury during sleep, so this part deserves careful evaluation.\n- Family history and onset in childhood increase the index of suspicion for a seizure tendency. Sleep loss is a common trigger for both sleep paralysis and seizures.\n\nWhat to ask your clinician to consider\n- Neurology evaluation (ideally an epileptologist).\n- EEG, preferably sleep‑deprived or prolonged ambulatory/video EEG to capture events.\n- Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol.\n- If daytime sleepiness is prominent or sleep paralysis/hallucinations are frequent, a sleep medicine referral and possibly a sleep study (with MSLT if narcolepsy is suspected).\n\nBefore your appointment\n- Keep a simple diary: date/time, what you felt, duration, triggers (sleep loss, stress), awareness changes, any after‑effects, and whether a headache follows. Note if anyone witnessed unresponsiveness, automatisms (lip‑smacking, fidgeting), or confusion.\n- If possible, have a bed partner or friend record an event on video (especially the sleep‑related ones).\n- Try to get details on family history (type of seizures, treatments).\n\nSafety tips for now\n- Prioritize regular sleep; avoid sleep deprivation and heavy alcohol. These lower seizure thresholds and worsen sleep paralysis.\n- Until you’re evaluated, avoid swimming alone, climbing heights, or bathing in a locked bathroom; use showers instead. Consider moving your bed slightly from the wall, lowering bed height, and padding sharp edges to reduce injury risk at night.\n- Driving: Laws vary by region. If you’ve had any episodes with impaired awareness or blackouts, it’s safest not to drive until you’ve been assessed and cleared.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- A convulsive event lasting 5 minutes or more, repeated seizures without recovery, a significant head injury, new weakness/speech/vision changes, or if events suddenly escalate in frequency or severity.\n\nA few clarifying questions you can think about or bring to your visit\n- Do these episodes feel identical each time (same smell/taste/euphoria), and do they cluster?\n- Any rising “wave” in the stomach, déjà vu/jamais vu, sudden fear, automatisms, time gaps, or confusion after?\n- Do headaches reliably follow, and if so, how long after and how long do they last?\n- Has anyone noticed you staring, pausing, or being unresponsive during episodes?\n- During the sleep events, are your eyes open, do you make sounds, or have full‑body jerks?\n\nBottom line: Your history does raise concern for focal seizures (possibly temporal lobe) alongside sleep‑related phenomena. Both are common, treatable, and best sorted with EEG/MRI and, if needed, a sleep study. Keep the appointment, bring a diary, and prioritize sleep in the meantime.",

    "question": "Male 31 non smoker 6’1” 250lbs, no history of epilepsy/seizuresI have always had sensitivity to lights while driving, especially at night. Things such as normal car headlights and signals have not caused a problem, however when it’s been raining or wet it causes the lights to be reflected off the pools of water it often disorients me and causes a dizzy feeling. I am in An area where it doesn’t rain now and yesterday had to drive through a tunnel covered with a crazy amount of LED lights, and with them reflecting off the cars I became almost instantly overwhelmingly dizzy and nauseous and had to pull over for 15 minutes for it to stop. I am not sure what is causing it, but I am afraid to drive at night or in certain areas because of this issue.",
    "answer": "What you describe sounds like visually induced dizziness (sometimes called visual vertigo) and can also overlap with vestibular migraine. Bright, high‑contrast, or flickering lights—especially LEDs and reflections from wet roads—can overwhelm the visual/vestibular system, causing sudden dizziness and nausea. This can happen even without a history of seizures and even if you don’t get a classic headache.\n\nOther contributors that are worth checking:\n- Uncorrected vision issues (even mild astigmatism or night myopia), binocular vision dysfunction, or convergence problems\n- Dry eye/tear film issues increasing glare and halos\n- Migraine spectrum sensitivity without headache (photophobia, motion sickness)\n- Less likely but important to rule out: inner-ear vestibular disorders, photosensitive seizures (usually include altered awareness or jerking), or neurologic causes\n\nSafety first\n- Until this is evaluated, avoid night driving, tunnels with intense LEDs, and rainy/wet conditions. If symptoms start, pull over safely right away.\n- Don’t wear tinted or “night driving” glasses at night; they reduce overall light and contrast and can make things more dangerous.\n\nPractical steps that often help\n- Keep the windshield and the inside glass extremely clean; replace wiper blades and consider a hydrophobic coating to reduce water film and glare.\n- Dim the dashboard and infotainment screen; keep the cabin as dark as safely possible to preserve night vision.\n- Use the rearview mirror’s anti‑glare (night) setting; consider auto‑dimming mirrors if available.\n- Aim your own headlights correctly; dirty or mis-aimed headlights increase scatter and glare.\n- In daytime rain/wet conditions, polarized sunglasses can reduce road reflections. Do not use them at night.\n- When facing oncoming headlights, briefly shift gaze slightly to the right road edge while keeping vehicles in peripheral view.\n\nWho to see\n- Eye care: Schedule a comprehensive eye exam (optometrist or ophthalmologist).\n  - Ask for a check of refraction (including astigmatism/night myopia), glare sensitivity, binocular vision/convergence, and dry eye.\n  - Anti‑reflective coatings on lenses help; treat any dry eye if present.\n- Vestibular/neurology: Ask your primary care clinician for referral to a neuro‑otologist/ENT or neurologist familiar with vestibular migraine/visual motion sensitivity, and to vestibular physical therapy.\n  - Vestibular rehab can desensitize visual motion triggers.\n  - If migraine spectrum is suspected, lifestyle measures and, if needed, preventive meds can help.\n\nSelf‑care that can reduce sensitivity\n- Keep regular sleep, hydration, meals, and exercise; limit alcohol and manage stress.\n- Track triggers (lighting type, rain, tunnels, fatigue, screen time, caffeine).\n- Some people with light sensitivity benefit from FL‑41 or similar lenses for indoor/screens; do not use them for night driving.\n\nUrgent red flags (seek immediate care)\n- Fainting/blackouts, loss of awareness, or involuntary jerking\n- New double vision, slurred speech, weakness, numbness, severe new headache\n- Continuous spinning vertigo with hearing loss, ringing, or ear fullness\n\nA few questions that would help narrow this down:\n- Do you get headaches, light/sound sensitivity, or motion sickness (now or as a child)?\n- Do busy visual environments (supermarkets, scrolling screens, first‑person video games) make you dizzy?\n- Any history of concussion, neck injury, or recent viral illness?\n- Do you notice halos, starbursts, or dryness in your eyes, especially with A/C or screens?\n- Do you wear glasses/contacts, and when was your last refraction?\n\nGiven how quickly and strongly the tunnel lights affected you, please avoid similar driving conditions until you’ve had an eye exam and a vestibular/migraine evaluation. If you’d like, I can help you prepare what to tell your doctor or suggest questions to ask at those visits.",

    "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing this—living with seizures into adulthood is tough, and you deserve more than “we don’t know the cause.” There are definitely other options to consider.\n\nBig picture\n- Having about one seizure a month means your epilepsy isn’t optimally controlled yet. The goal is zero seizures.\n- If you’ve tried only lamotrigine so far, there are several other first-line options for generalized epilepsy.\n- If you’ve tried two appropriate medicines at good doses without control, that meets criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy and you should be referred to a specialist epilepsy center for advanced options.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) Get a second opinion/referral\n- Ask your GP for referral to a tertiary/complex epilepsy service or different consultant (you’re entitled to this on the NHS). Centers can reassess diagnosis, meds, and offer device/dietary options.\n- If it’s been a while, ask for updated tests: repeat EEG (possibly prolonged/video EEG) and MRI brain using an epilepsy protocol. This can confirm generalized epilepsy and rule out focal causes.\n\n2) Medication options to discuss\nFor genetic/generalized epilepsies (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy), these are effective:\n- Valproate: Often the most effective for generalized seizures in men. Downsides: weight gain, tremor, hair changes, liver/platelet effects. As a man, the pregnancy restrictions don’t apply, but labs and monitoring are needed.\n- Levetiracetam: Common and effective; watch for mood/irritability (vitamin B6 sometimes helps).\n- Topiramate or zonisamide: Can help; may cause cognitive slowing, kidney stones; often cause weight loss.\n- Perampanel: Add‑on for primary generalized tonic‑clonic seizures; can affect mood/balance.\n- Clobazam: Can be a useful add‑on or used short‑term around clear triggers; tolerance and sleepiness are possible.\n- Lamotrigine: Useful, but can worsen myoclonus in some. If you mainly have morning myoclonic jerks, another drug may work better.\nImportant: If valproate is added to lamotrigine, the lamotrigine dose usually needs to be reduced and re‑titrated because valproate raises its levels.\n\n3) Non‑drug options if seizures continue\n- Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): Can reduce seizure frequency/severity in generalized epilepsies.\n- Dietary therapy with a specialist dietitian (Modified Atkins/Ketogenic): Evidence supports use in adults with refractory generalized epilepsy.\n- Clinical trials at epilepsy centers.\n\n4) Alcohol, sleep, and triggers\n- Alcohol is a common trigger, especially binge drinking and the hangover/sleep loss that follows. Safer approach: avoid binges; stick to low amounts (ideally ≤1–2 units on an occasion), don’t skip doses, hydrate, and prioritize sleep.\n- Keep strict sleep routine; sleep deprivation is a big trigger, especially for morning seizures.\n- Track triggers: missed doses, stress, illness, flashing lights/screens, jet lag.\n\n5) Rescue plan and safety\n- Ask for a rescue med (e.g., buccal midazolam 10 mg) for seizures >5 minutes or clusters. Make sure family/coworkers know when and how to use it.\n- Work: Under the Equality Act 2010, you can request reasonable adjustments (no lone work at heights/in water, avoid unguarded machinery/open flames, colleagues trained in seizure first aid, a seizure action plan).\n- Night-time: If your seizures happen in sleep, consider a seizure alert device and avoid sleeping face‑down. Reducing GTCS frequency is the main way to reduce SUDEP risk.\n\n6) Travel tips\n- Never miss doses. For time zones, shift your dosing by 1–2 hours per day in the days before travel, or ask your pharmacist/epilepsy nurse for a simple plan.\n- Carry meds in hand luggage in original boxes plus a doctor’s letter. Set phone alarms.\n- Buy travel insurance that covers epilepsy. Avoid high‑risk activities without supervision (deep water, heights).\n\n7) Driving (UK)\n- For most people with epilepsy, you need 12 months seizure‑free (while awake) before driving a car/motorcycle. There are some specific exceptions (e.g., seizures only during sleep), but monthly seizures will keep the license withheld. The quickest way back to driving is better seizure control.\n\n8) Health checks worth doing\n- Confirm your current lamotrigine dose; many adults need 200–400 mg/day (unless interacting medicines).\n- If you snore, stop breathing at night, or are very sleepy in the day, ask to be screened for sleep apnoea—treating it can reduce seizures.\n- Basic labs per the medicine chosen (e.g., liver function and platelets for valproate).\n- Consider weight management and exercise; good for overall brain health and mood.\n\nQuestions that would help tailor advice\n- What seizure types do you have (convulsions, myoclonic jerks, absences)? Do they cluster in the morning?\n- Current lamotrigine dose and any prior anti‑seizure meds you’ve tried?\n- Any clear triggers (sleep loss, alcohol, stress, screens)?\n- When was your last EEG/MRI and what did they show?\n- Any mood issues or side effects from lamotrigine?\n\nIf you want, share those details and I can suggest a concrete medication plan to discuss with your doctor.\n\nUseful UK resources\n- Epilepsy Action (helpline, workplace and travel guidance)\n- Epilepsy Society\n- SUDEP Action\n- Local epilepsy specialist nurses (often available via your hospital trust)\n\nWhen to seek urgent help\n- Seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, serious injury, or first-time cluster: call emergency services.\n\nYou deserve a proactive plan. Pushing for a second opinion and revisiting treatment options (especially valproate or levetiracetam in men with generalized epilepsy) is very reasonable and often life‑changing.",

    "question": "22F, 5’5, 173lb, whitehi there! weird thing happened last night and i’m nervous and hoping someone might have some input for me. i recently started taking prozac (10mg) in conjunction with lamictal (125mg) (which i’ve been on for about 6 weeks) for MDD. i’ve had a huge decrease in appetite which has led to me forgetting to eat a lot. yesterday i ate very little - almost nothing, without realizing. i was smoking weed with my partner and i started to feel really unwell. i have a low tolerance so i didn’t think much of it. i remember telling him i wanted to lay down, and next thing i knew i woke up to him holding me and saying my name over and over. he asked me a bunch of questions about my surroundings and personal information (address, birthday, etc.) to make sure i was aware and coherent. he said i was sitting there, mentioned i wanted to lay down, and then my body stiffened/seized up and i slid down the chair backwards until i was on the floor and he started trying to wake me up. he said in total, i was out for less than a minute, but he was worried i was having a seizure. while i was out, i was having what felt like a short lucid dream where i was rolling down a mountain, if that’s important. when i came back to my senses, i was sweating a lot, and was nauseous. i laid on the floor for a little bit until i felt okay, and then went to bed. today i feel fine.i figured i just fainted bc i hadn’t eaten and i was smoking, but i know serotonin syndrome can cause seizures so i’m just feeling very anxious and wondering if i’m worrying over nothing. i’ve never fainted or had a seizure so i don’t really know what either one feel like.",
    "answer": "Short answer: What you describe most likely sounds like a faint (vasovagal/orthostatic syncope) with brief “convulsive” movements, triggered by not eating, dehydration, and cannabis. Serotonin syndrome is very unlikely here. Because this was your first loss of consciousness, it’s still important to let your prescriber/PCP know and get checked soon.\n\nWhy fainting fits better than a seizure or serotonin syndrome:\n- Common triggers you had: very little food/fluid, cannabis (can drop blood pressure), feeling unwell with nausea/sweats before and after.\n- In convulsive syncope the body can briefly stiffen or jerk while blood flow to the brain is low, and people often wake up quickly and feel okay after a short rest. That matches your rapid recovery and short duration (<1 minute).\n- Serotonin syndrome usually causes ongoing symptoms: agitation/confusion, fever, fast heart rate, high blood pressure, tremor, clonus/hyperreflexia, and persistent sweating/diarrhea. Seizures are uncommon and typically occur in severe toxicity. Lamotrigine isn’t serotonergic, and fluoxetine 10 mg alone makes serotonin syndrome very unlikely.\n\nStill, first-time blackout = get evaluated:\n- Make an appointment in the next few days with your PCP or the prescriber. Ask for: vitals including orthostatic blood pressure, ECG, basic labs (CBC, electrolytes, glucose), and a medication review.\n- Seek urgent care/ER now if you develop any red flags: chest pain, sustained palpitations, shortness of breath, severe or worsening headache, repeated vomiting, high fever, confusion, weakness on one side, another loss of consciousness, or if you injure yourself.\n\nWhat to do now:\n- Avoid cannabis and alcohol until you’re evaluated and your appetite is back to normal.\n- Eat regular meals and snacks with some salt and protein; set phone reminders if your appetite is low. Stay well hydrated (aim for pale-yellow urine).\n- Rise slowly from sitting/lying; avoid hot showers and standing for long periods.\n- Talk to your prescriber about the appetite loss from fluoxetine; this is common early on and often improves in 1–3 weeks. They may suggest timing the dose (often morning), taking it with food, or adjusting the plan if weight loss/appetite stay problematic.\n\nIf it happens again:\n- Lie down and elevate legs as soon as you feel faint. If you do pass out, your partner should:\n  - Lay you on your side, protect your head, don’t restrain you, and time the event.\n  - Call emergency services if unconsciousness lasts longer than 1–2 minutes, breathing isn’t normal, there’s a significant injury, or recovery isn’t quick.\n- Avoid driving, swimming alone, heights, or operating machinery until you’ve been seen and your clinician says it’s safe.\n\nIf you can, share a few details with your clinician:\n- How long you were out, how quickly you felt normal, any tongue biting, urinary incontinence, significant confusion after, palpitations, or injuries.\n- Exactly when you started fluoxetine, and whether you’ve had weight loss since starting.\n\nBased on what you’ve shared, this sounds most consistent with a faint exacerbated by not eating and cannabis, rather than a seizure or serotonin syndrome, but getting checked is the right next step.",

    "question": "Hi. I’m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn’t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn’t actually true- I hadn’t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine…but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn’t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I’d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn’t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I’d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you went through all of that. What you describe sounds frightening and exhausting, and it’s understandable you felt desperate when the jerks wouldn’t stop. I’m glad you’re safe now.\n\nWhat may be going on\n- Your history is very typical of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), a type of genetic generalized epilepsy:\n  - Years of myoclonic jerks (sudden “jolts”), often worse with sleep loss, sometimes around waking or sleep transitions.\n  - A generalized tonic–clonic seizure after sleep deprivation.\n  - Normal EEGs in between seizures are common; a normal EEG never rules out epilepsy.\n- Why things “went downhill”:\n  1) You were taken off anti‑seizure medicine based on no tonic–clonic seizures, but the myoclonic jerks were still seizures. In JME, stopping medicine often leads to relapse, especially with sleep loss.\n  2) You abruptly stopped effective levetiracetam (Keppra) and substituted a very low, starter dose of lamotrigine (25 mg/day). That dose is intentionally subtherapeutic to prevent rash and would not protect you. Abruptly removing Keppra can unmask seizures.\n  3) Lamotrigine can help generalized tonic–clonic seizures but can worsen myoclonic seizures in JME for some people. So low‑dose lamotrigine alone likely did not control (and may have aggravated) the myoclonus.\n  4) Severe sleep deprivation is a powerful trigger in JME and likely precipitated the relapse.\n\nWhere to go from here\nPlease review this with an epilepsy specialist (epileptologist). Bring a written timeline like the one you shared. Key points to discuss:\n- Diagnosis: “Does my history fit JME/genetic generalized epilepsy?” Consider a sleep‑deprived EEG with photic stimulation if not already done. Normal results would not change treatment if the clinical picture is clear.\n- Medication strategy:\n  - Levetiracetam is often first‑line for JME and was working for you. Typical total daily doses are 1.5–3 g/day (some need up to 4 g/day). Your current 2 g/day is reasonable, but you’re still having myoclonus at sleep onset.\n  - Lamotrigine can worsen myoclonus in JME. If it’s not clearly helping, your team may consider tapering it off rather than increasing it. Don’t change it on your own.\n  - If Keppra alone isn’t enough or isn’t tolerated, other options sometimes used: valproate (most effective for JME but usually avoided in women of childbearing potential unless no alternative; requires reliable contraception and folic acid), topiramate, or zonisamide. Avoid medicines that can worsen generalized/myoclonic seizures (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin/pregabalin, tiagabine, vigabatrin).\n  - Any switch should be done with overlap/cross‑titration. Never stop a working med abruptly unless instructed.\n- Clobazam/benzodiazepines:\n  - Helpful as rescue or short “bridge” during high‑risk times (e.g., after severe sleep loss or around menses), but regular use can lead to tolerance and dependence. Ask for a personalized rescue plan (e.g., clobazam at bedtime for 2–3 nights when sleep‑deprived, or a prescribed intranasal midazolam/diazepam for emergencies).\n- Level checks and side effects:\n  - Consider checking trough levels of lamotrigine and routine labs. If mood irritability is an issue on Keppra, some people benefit from vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) after discussing with their clinician.\n\nTrigger management\n- Sleep: Make this a “treatment.” Fixed sleep/wake times, avoid all‑nighters, limit alcohol, caffeine late in the day, and screen use at night. If insomnia is a problem, ask about CBT‑I; some clinicians allow short‑term melatonin.\n- Other triggers: alcohol binges, significant stress, missed doses, flashing lights (if photosensitive), and possibly menstruation. Track seizures vs your cycle; if there’s a pattern, your team might use short‑term clobazam or adjust dosing around that time.\n\nSafety and planning\n- Don’t drive or do high‑risk activities until you meet your local seizure‑free rules.\n- Ask for a written seizure action plan and a reliable rescue medication.\n- Consider a medication refill plan so you don’t run out; use reminders/pill organizers.\n- Discuss pregnancy plans. If there’s any chance of pregnancy, take folic acid (usually 0.4–1 mg/day; higher if on valproate, per your doctor).\n\nAbout the suicidal thoughts\nYou mentioned feeling like you’d rather end your life than keep having the jerks. If those thoughts return or feel hard to control, please seek help urgently.\n- UK resources: call NHS 111, go to A&E, call 999 if in immediate danger. Samaritans 116 123 (24/7). Text SHOUT to 85258.\n- Tell your neurology team about this experience; unrelenting seizures and medication changes can severely affect mood, and Keppra can sometimes worsen irritability/anxiety.\n\nA few clarifying questions to help your clinicians:\n- Do your jerks cluster at sleep onset, on awakening, or both? Any pattern with your period?\n- Any photosensitivity? Alcohol use? Recent new meds or supplements?\n- Side effects on your current doses (mood, cognition, sleep, rash)?\n- Are you planning pregnancy in the next few years, and what contraception are you using?\n\nBottom line\nNothing here suggests you “did something wrong.” The relapse is very plausibly explained by stopping an effective JME medicine, substituting a subtherapeutic dose of another that can aggravate myoclonus, plus severe sleep deprivation. With the right diagnosis, steady medication plan (likely centered on levetiracetam or another JME‑effective agent), trigger management, and a rescue strategy, many people with JME regain excellent control. Please link back in with an epilepsy specialist and don’t make any changes without a clear cross‑taper plan.",

    "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age — it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",
    "answer": "I’m sorry that happened—what you describe sounds very much like a generalized tonic–clonic seizure with a typical post‑ictal phase (confusion, fatigue, muscle soreness). A normal CT, labs, and EKG in the ER are common after a first seizure; MRI and an EEG are the next important steps.\n\nHow common is this, and what does it mean?\n- About 8–10% of people will have a seizure at some point in life. Only ~2–3% develop epilepsy (recurrent unprovoked seizures).\n- Risk of another seizure after a first unprovoked seizure is about 30–40% over 2 years. The risk is higher if the MRI or EEG show abnormalities; lower if both are normal.\n- If the seizure was “provoked” by a factor such as medication, alcohol/drug use, sleep deprivation, dehydration/overheating, or a metabolic issue, recurrence risk is much lower once the trigger is removed.\n- Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a known seizure‑threshold–lowering medication, and the risk increases with higher doses, missed doses, eating disorders, alcohol use/withdrawal, sleep deprivation, or heat/dehydration. On-label guidance generally recommends stopping bupropion after any seizure—please discuss urgently with your prescriber about tapering off vs. reducing dose and alternatives for mood treatment.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Ask your neurologist for an EEG (ideally within 1–2 weeks; sleep‑deprived EEG can increase yield) and ensure your MRI is done with an epilepsy protocol.\n- Until you’ve been evaluated, prioritize regular sleep, good hydration, regular meals, and avoid alcohol/recreational drugs.\n- Keep a seizure log (date/time, what you were doing, possible triggers, witnesses’ description, recovery time).\n\nDriving and safety\n- Follow your local driving laws. Many places require 3–6 months seizure‑free before driving again; ask your neurologist about your state’s rules and any reporting requirements.\n- For now, avoid high‑risk situations: swimming alone, bathing in a tub (take showers instead), heights/ladders, operating heavy machinery, open flames/hot oil cooking, and being on rooftops or near open water without supervision.\n\nReturning to activities\n- Light activity (walking, gentle stretching) is fine as you recover from soreness/fatigue.\n- Dancing: generally okay to resume soon with precautions—go with a friend, stay well‑hydrated, avoid overheating, and be cautious with venues that use strobe/flashing lights (photosensitivity is uncommon but possible). Start with short, lower‑intensity sessions and see how you feel.\n- Sewing machine: because it’s a moving/sharp tool, wait until you’ve at least discussed with your neurologist and have been seizure‑free for a bit. When you restart, do so with someone nearby at first, use safety guards, keep speed slow, keep hair/sleeves secured, and take breaks.\n- Swimming, climbing, or contact sports should wait until you’ve had your neuro follow‑up and a clear safety plan; if you swim, always with a lifeguard or close supervision.\n\nPost‑seizure recovery\n- Muscle soreness and fatigue for a day or two (sometimes up to a week) are common. Headaches can also follow. Seek care urgently if you develop fever, stiff neck, a new severe headache, repeated vomiting, confusion that isn’t improving, new weakness/numbness, another seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, or any injury from a fall.\n\nShare seizure first aid with family/partner\n- Protect the head, turn on the side, don’t put anything in the mouth, don’t restrain, time the event, and call EMS if it lasts >5 minutes, recurs, there’s an injury, trouble breathing, the person is pregnant, or recovery is not occurring.\n\nIf you can, let your neurologist know this happened before your upcoming appointment so they can add an EEG and review your medications, especially bupropion. Given your beach day, think about potential triggers (heat, dehydration, sleep loss, alcohol); avoiding those can meaningfully reduce risk while you await workup.",

    "question": "Hello, I am 24 and I was diagnosed with epilepsy around 2 years ago, and prior to this I thought epilepsy was 1) you were born with it, and 2) it was caused due to flashing lights. My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had. I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.",
    "answer": "You’re not alone in thinking epilepsy is “born with it” or “caused by flashing lights,” but most epilepsy doesn’t work that way. A few key points that usually help:\n\n- Photosensitive epilepsy is uncommon. Only about 3–5% of people with epilepsy are triggered by flashing lights. If clubs and strobes haven’t bothered you, you’re probably not photosensitive.\n- Many people have no obvious triggers. Seizures don’t need an external trigger to happen. Brain excitability naturally fluctuates; when it crosses a threshold, a seizure can occur “out of the blue.”\n- Cause vs trigger vs threshold:\n  - Cause: the underlying reason you have epilepsy (genetic tendency, a small brain scar, past infection/trauma, autoimmune causes, etc.). In about 50–60% of adults, no specific cause is found even after good tests—this is called “unknown” or “idiopathic.”\n  - Trigger: things that make a seizure more likely that day (sleep deprivation, missed meds, heavy alcohol/hangover, intercurrent illness/fever, stress, dehydration). Many people don’t have clear triggers.\n  - Threshold: your brain’s susceptibility at any moment; it naturally cycles with sleep, hormones, and other internal rhythms. That’s why seizures can feel random even without triggers.\n- Onset in the late teens/20s is common. Some “genetic generalized” epilepsies don’t show up until adolescence/early adulthood; others are “focal” (starting in one area of the brain). Both can appear without any flashing lights.\n- Tests can be normal and you can still have epilepsy. MRI can miss very small abnormalities; EEG is often normal between seizures. That doesn’t invalidate the diagnosis if your history fits and a neurologist has assessed you.\n\nThings you can do that actually help, even when you don’t see triggers:\n- Keep a simple seizure diary (or an app like Epsy, Seizure Tracker). Include sleep, alcohol, stress, illness, missed doses. Over weeks, patterns sometimes emerge (for example, more likely after late nights).\n- Prioritise sleep and strict medication adherence. These two are the biggest risk reducers.\n- Moderate alcohol (binge + hangover is a common hidden trigger). Hydrate.\n- If seizures cluster at certain times of day, discuss with your neurologist—there are known daily/multiday seizure cycles and sometimes med timing can be adjusted.\n- Have a safety plan: showers instead of baths, caution with heights and swimming (use supervision), and make sure people around you know when to call 999 (seizure >5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, injury, breathing problems).\n\nIf you’re in the UK:\n- Epilepsy Action and Epilepsy Society have excellent info and helplines.\n- DVLA driving rules depend on seizure type and control; your neurologist can advise what applies to you.\n\nIf you’re up for it, I can tailor information better with a few details:\n- What type of seizures were you told you have (focal, generalized, or “unknown”)? Any auras or morning jerks?\n- What tests have you had (EEG, MRI) and what were the results?\n- What medication are you on, and how have the seizures been since starting it?\n\nHappy to explain your specific type, common patterns, and practical steps based on your answers.",

What you describe is not “hypochondria” or “drug seeking.” Multiple generalized seizures in a cluster and near-constant myoclonic jerks despite medication is a medical red flag that calls for prompt, active management.\n\nWhen to seek urgent help\n- Call emergency services now or any time you have:\n  - A seizure lasting ≥5 minutes, or repeated seizures without full recovery between them (that’s status epilepticus risk).\n  - A cluster that isn’t stopping with your prescribed rescue med (or you don’t have one).\n  - A significant injury, trouble breathing, pregnancy, or new/really different seizures.\n- After a cluster like you described (9 focal-to-generalized without awareness between), you need urgent neurology follow-up—ideally within days.\n\nWhat to ask for next\n- A referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center (epileptologist). If you’ve had inadequate control on an appropriately dosed medicine for months, this meets criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy, and you deserve specialist care.\n- A written seizure action plan and a home rescue medication for clusters:\n  - Intranasal midazolam (Nayzilam) or diazepam (Valtoco) are common, effective, noninvasive options. Rectal diazepam is another option.\n- A change in your daily antiseizure regimen. If levetiracetam (Keppra) is failing, it’s reasonable to switch or add a second agent—done with a careful cross‑taper to avoid worsening.\n\nMedicines to discuss with your doctor (not medical advice—options to consider)\nChoice depends on your seizure type (focal vs generalized/myoclonic), side effects, other health factors, and pregnancy plans:\n\n- If seizures are generalized/myoclonic (myoclonic jerks suggest this):\n  - Often effective: valproate (very effective but generally avoided in people who could become pregnant due to birth‑defect/cognitive risks), levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide.\n  - Lamotrigine can help generalized seizures but may worsen myoclonus in some.\n  - Clobazam or clonazepam can help with myoclonus (sometimes as a cyclic add‑on).\n  - Avoid for primary generalized/myoclonic: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, tiagabine, pregabalin, gabapentin—they can worsen myoclonus/absence.\n\n- If seizures start focally and generalize:\n  - Options include lamotrigine, lacosamide, oxcarbazepine/eslicarbazepine, topiramate, perampanel, brivaracetam (sometimes works when levetiracetam doesn’t), cenobamate (highly effective for focal seizures; requires slow titration and specialist oversight).\n  - Discuss interactions with hormones/contraceptives if relevant (enzyme‑inducing meds can reduce hormonal contraceptive effectiveness; estrogen can lower lamotrigine levels).\n\nCatamenial (hormone‑linked) patterns\n- Keep a seizure diary aligned with your menstrual cycle to confirm pattern.\n- Options some specialists use:\n  - Temporary perimenstrual dose increases of your baseline ASM.\n  - Cyclic clobazam or acetazolamide around high‑risk days.\n  - Natural progesterone therapy or cycle suppression (e.g., depot medroxyprogesterone, certain IUDs). Note interactions between ASMs and hormonal contraception.\n- These require individualized planning with an epileptologist.\n\nBeyond medication\n- Rescue plan: Clear instructions on when to use intranasal midazolam/diazepam for clusters or prolonged events.\n- Evaluation if drug‑resistant after 2 adequate trials: video‑EEG monitoring, MRI, and consideration of:\n  - Surgery if a focal onset zone can be safely removed/ablated.\n  - Neurostimulation: VNS, RNS, or DBS for nonresectable cases.\n- Sleep and stress:\n  - Rigid sleep schedule; screen/treat sleep apnea if snoring/daytime sleepiness.\n  - Stress‑reduction techniques (CBT, mindfulness, biofeedback) alongside medical therapy.\n- Safety/SUDEP risk reduction:\n  - Take meds consistently; avoid alcohol/binge drinking.\n  - Nighttime precautions: side‑sleeping, low bed, remove sharp edges; consider a seizure‑alert device if helpful.\n  - Water safety (showers instead of baths), cooking precautions, and follow driving laws.\n\nHow to advocate for yourself\n- Bring a concise seizure log (dates, type, duration, triggers, injuries, recovery) and any video a witness can capture safely.\n- Say plainly: “I’ve had monthly clusters with up to nine generalized seizures without awareness in between. Levetiracetam is not controlling my seizures. This meets drug‑resistant criteria. I need: 1) a rescue medication and action plan, 2) a change in daily therapy, and 3) referral to an epilepsy center.”\n- Bring a family member/friend to appointments.\n- If your current clinician won’t engage in a clear plan, ask for a second opinion or self‑refer to a Level 3/4 epilepsy center.\n\nBottom line\nYour pattern is serious and warrants prompt changes: a rescue med, a new regimen, and specialist evaluation. Given your triggers (hormones, stress, sleep) and myoclonus, catamenial strategies and careful selection of an ASM suited to your seizure type are especially important. If you’d like, tell me your current Keppra dose, other meds, and any contraception/pregnancy plans, and I can outline a focused list of options to discuss with your doctor.",

    "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I’ve haven’t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we’re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it’s seriously scaring me. He’s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I’ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he’s awake and coherent, but he’s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I’m bothering him and he “doesn’t need any medicine”. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you’ve already done—keeping him safe, turning him on his side, staying with him—is exactly right. But the pattern you’re describing today is concerning.\n\nGiven he’s had four grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures today plus another seizure this morning, and he’s not reliably taking meds, this meets common “call now” criteria. Seizure clusters can progress to status epilepticus (a medical emergency). Please call emergency services now.\n\nWhy call now\n- More than one tonic-clonic seizure without full return to baseline between them, or 3+ in 24 hours, is a red flag.\n- He’s in significant pain, unusually sleepy/confused, and refusing medication.\n- He may need rescue medication, IV fluids, labs (including antiseizure drug levels, electrolytes), and evaluation for triggers (infection, head injury, etc.).\n\nAbout the driver’s license: rules vary by state/country, but generally the key issue is being seizure‑free for a period (often 3–12 months). If he’s having multiple seizures today, he shouldn’t be driving regardless. Don’t delay care because of license worries—safety comes first. Calling an ambulance doesn’t automatically revoke a license.\n\nWhile you wait for EMS\n- Keep him on his side, cushion his head, clear nearby hazards.\n- Don’t restrain him and don’t put anything in his mouth.\n- Time any seizure activity; video if safe.\n- Check breathing and color; if he’s not breathing after the shaking stops, start rescue breathing/CPR if trained.\n- If he has a prescribed rescue med (intranasal midazolam/diazepam or rectal diazepam) and you know how to use it, follow the seizure action plan on the label.\n- Gather: medication list and last doses, any missed doses, neurologist’s info, allergies, details of today’s seizures, recent illness/alcohol/other substances, any head injury.\n\nAfter today (when he’s safe)\n- Call his neurologist urgently to report today’s cluster. Ask for:\n  - A written seizure action plan.\n  - Rescue medication to use at home for future clusters.\n  - Medication review and blood levels; consider side effects (irritability can be post‑seizure or from meds like levetiracetam).\n- Set up a strict medication routine (alarms, pill organizer, observed doses). Only give meds when he’s fully awake and upright to avoid choking.\n- Track seizures (time, duration, features, triggers) in a log or app.\n- Reduce triggers: consistent sleep, no alcohol or recreational drugs, don’t skip doses, manage illness/fever.\n- Safety at home: supervise bathing, avoid heights/open flames when alone, use a seizure pillow/bedroom safety measures.\n\nAbout his behavior: agitation and “being a jerk” can be part of the postictal period—he may not be fully aware. Keep the environment quiet and low‑stimulus, speak calmly and simply, and avoid confrontations until he’s back to baseline.\n\nIf his family questions calling 911, you can simply say: he had multiple grand mal seizures today and didn’t return to normal—medical guidelines say to call. You’re acting to keep him safe.\n\nIf you need support, the Epilepsy Foundation has a 24/7 helpline: 1-800-332-1000 (US). If you’re outside the US, local epilepsy organizations can help you develop an action plan.\n\nIf anything changes before EMS arrives—another seizure, trouble breathing, injury—call back immediately.",

    "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
    "answer": "Short answer: Anxiety or stress by themselves don’t “cause” epilepsy. They can, however:\n- Trigger seizures in people who already have epilepsy.\n- Cause seizure-like episodes called psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), which look like seizures but aren’t due to abnormal brain electrical activity and are linked to psychological stress.\n- Lower your “seizure threshold” when combined with things like sleep deprivation, illness, dehydration, or substance use, making a first seizure more likely in someone who’s vulnerable (even if they’ve never had one before).\n\nImportant points:\n- Epilepsy is usually diagnosed after two unprovoked seizures (or one with a high risk of recurrence). Many people can have a single seizure in their life from an acute trigger (fever, infection, low blood sugar, low sodium, head injury, drugs/alcohol, certain medicines like bupropion or tramadol, or severe sleep deprivation).\n- Stress and anxiety can worsen seizure control if someone already has epilepsy, but they don’t typically create epilepsy out of nowhere.\n- PNES are real, can be brought on by stress/anxiety, and are treated with psychological therapies rather than anti-seizure medicines.\n\nIf you or someone you know has had a “seizure-like” episode:\n- Get medical evaluation soon (primary care or neurology). They may order blood tests, an EEG, and sometimes a brain MRI to sort out causes.\n- Go to emergency care now if a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, there are repeated seizures without full recovery, there’s injury, trouble breathing, it’s a first-ever seizure, or the person is confused for a long time afterward.\n\nSafety until evaluated:\n- Prioritize sleep (8–10 hours for teens), good hydration, regular meals.\n- Avoid alcohol, cannabis, vaping high-nicotine products, stimulants, or any recreational drugs; review meds/supplements with a clinician.\n- Limit intense screen flicker/flashing lights if you notice sensitivity.\n- Don’t swim alone or climb to heights; use a shower instead of a bath.\n- If you drive, check local rules—many places require a seizure-free interval before driving.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what happened (what it looked like, how long it lasted, confusion afterward, tongue biting, incontinence, triggers, any video). That can help distinguish epileptic seizures, syncope (fainting), panic attacks, or PNES and guide next steps.",

    "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

No fevers, no vomiting, no nausea.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry she’s going through this. Given the severity and persistence of her pain, reduced intake/weight loss, and today’s dizziness with falls, she needs an in‑person assessment urgently (today or within 24 hours). If she faints again, can’t keep fluids down, develops fever, blood in stool/vomit, green (bilious) vomiting, severe right‑lower or right‑upper abdominal pain, chest pain, or worsening weakness/confusion—go to the emergency department.\n\nWhy urgent: \n- Constant severe pain that is worse after eating and activity\n- Recent weight loss and poor appetite\n- New dizziness/lightheadedness with falls (possible dehydration, low blood pressure, medication side effect, or autonomic dysfunction)\n- Very complex bowel/bladder history and a heavy laxative regimen that can itself cause cramping/pain and fluid shifts\n\nImportant possibilities to consider (not a diagnosis):\n- Significant stool burden/impaction from neurogenic bowel/megacolon causing generalized and right‑sided abdominal pain and early satiety\n- Medication effects, especially from laxatives (linaclotide, lactulose, bisacodyl, magnesium citrate) which commonly cause cramping and pain; clonidine can cause low blood pressure/dizziness\n- Upper GI issues: reflux/esophagitis or eosinophilic esophagitis (lump-in-throat/globus, pain after meals), peptic irritation (H. pylori was negative but still possible non‑H. pylori gastritis)\n- Gastroparesis or other GI dysmotility related to autonomic neuropathy (fits with pain after meals and poor appetite)\n- Less common but important: gallbladder disease, ovarian cyst/torsion, inflammatory bowel disease (less likely with normal ESR/CRP but not excluded), median arcuate ligament syndrome or SMA syndrome in thin adolescents (post‑prandial pain/early satiety), appendiceal or cecal issues\n\nWhat to do now\n- Hydration: Offer frequent oral rehydration solution or electrolyte drinks; target pale yellow urine. If she can’t keep up with fluids or dizziness persists, seek care today.\n- Safety for dizziness: Have her rise slowly; sit or lie down with legs elevated when lightheaded.\n- Pain: Avoid NSAIDs on an empty stomach. Use heat packs if helpful. Hold off on new over‑the‑counter remedies until she’s seen.\n- Do not change seizure medicines without her neurologist’s advice.\n\nMedication review to discuss with her doctors ASAP\n- The listed clonidine “5 mg daily” looks off. Pediatric doses are usually in the 0.05–0.3 mg range total per day. Please double‑check units and formulation.\n- Linaclotide (Linzess) 290 mcg daily is an adult dose; in children 6–17 the approved dose is 72 mcg for functional constipation. Abdominal pain is a common side effect at higher doses. Do not change it on your own, but bring this up urgently with her GI.\n- Chronic daily stimulant laxative (bisacodyl) can worsen cramping. Given her neurogenic bowel this may still be needed, but the regimen may need rebalancing (e.g., prokinetic vs stimulant, scheduled cleanouts, or motility‑guided plan).\n- Because of the heavy laxative burden, ask about checking electrolytes again (including magnesium and phosphorus) and assessing hydration.\n\nWhat to ask her clinicians to check\n- Exam with orthostatic vitals (lying/standing heart rate and blood pressure) to evaluate for orthostatic intolerance/POTS and medication‑related hypotension\n- Labs: repeat CMP (electrolytes), magnesium, phosphorus, iron studies/ferritin, vitamin D repletion plan; consider morning cortisol if clinically indicated\n- Abdominal X‑ray (KUB) to assess stool burden/impaction given her megacolon and pain\n- Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound to assess gallbladder, kidneys, and ovaries\n- If upper GI symptoms persist: referral for pediatric GI evaluation with possible trials (acid suppression) and, if needed, endoscopy (EGD) with biopsies to look for reflux injury or eosinophilic esophagitis\n- If post‑prandial pain and early satiety remain prominent: gastric emptying study for gastroparesis; consider upper GI contrast study or CTA if SMA syndrome is suspected\n- Fecal calprotectin to screen for inflammatory bowel disease despite normal ESR/CRP\n- Pediatric motility evaluation (anorectal/colonic manometry) at a center experienced with neurogenic bowel to optimize her regimen and reduce pain\n\nHelpful day‑to‑day measures (while awaiting care)\n- Small, frequent, lower‑fat meals; avoid large/high‑fat meals and carbonated drinks. Stay upright 1–2 hours after eating.\n- Keep a simple symptom log: time of meals, meds taken, pain severity/location, bowel movements (time/consistency), dizziness episodes, and any triggers. This will help her clinicians.\n\nPlease reply with:\n- Clarification of the exact doses/units for clonidine, lactulose, magnesium citrate, and Linzess\n- Whether she’s had any imaging (abdominal X‑ray/ultrasound) or endoscopy\n- Whether she has nausea, trouble swallowing, food getting stuck, nighttime pain, blood in stool, changes around her menstrual cycle, or urinary symptoms\n\nBut most importantly, because of the severity, weight loss, and today’s lightheaded falls, she should be seen urgently. If you can’t get a same‑day pediatric or GI appointment, take her to urgent care or the emergency department for evaluation and hydration. Bring a complete medication list and this history.",

    "question": "Not sure if this is allowed- (20F/medical MJ patient/white) I've been trying to get this figured out for YEARS now, no one takes me seriously. Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’ve felt dismissed. What you’re describing deserves a proper work‑up.\n\nHow this can fit temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)\n- Many people with TLE have focal aware seizures (auras) with déjà vu, a sudden wave of fear/doom, nausea or a “rising” stomach feeling, odd tastes/smells, and brief tingling. Awareness can be preserved. Episodes often last seconds to 1–2 minutes, can cluster for days, then go quiet for weeks–months.\n- The “I know what’s about to happen” feeling is a classic description of déjà vu from mesial temporal seizures.\n- Nausea and head sensations can accompany these. The temporal lobe itself doesn’t feel pain; “pressure” is a subjective sensation.\n\nThings that don’t perfectly fit and other possibilities\n- 10-minute spells are a bit long for typical temporal auras. That can still happen, but it also raises other possibilities:\n  - Migraine aura variants (often 5–60 minutes, sometimes with head pressure, nausea, light/sound sensitivity; may or may not be followed by headache).\n  - Panic attacks/derealization (intense dread, nausea, tingling, last 10–20 minutes).\n  - Less commonly, occipital lobe seizures cause visual phenomena (flashes, zigzags), not just pressure.\n- Cannabis: CBD can help some epilepsies, but higher-THC products can provoke anxiety/panic and sometimes mimic or trigger spells. Track any relationship to use, dose, and THC:CBD ratio.\n\nWhat to do next\n- See a neurologist (ideally an epilepsy specialist). Ask directly: “Could these be focal aware seizures from the temporal lobe?” and request:\n  - EEG (consider sleep‑deprived or prolonged/ambulatory EEG to catch an event).\n  - Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol.\n- Bring your logs. If possible, capture an episode on video and note exact start/stop times and any triggers.\n- Track patterns: sleep loss, stress, illness, alcohol, menstrual cycle (catamenial patterns are common), and cannabis timing/dose.\n\nTreatment if it is TLE\n- Many people do very well on antiseizure meds (examples: lamotrigine, levetiracetam, lacosamide, carbamazepine). In women of childbearing age, some drugs are preferred over others—your neurologist will tailor this.\n- If meds don’t control it, specialized centers offer options like targeted surgery or neuromodulation. But step one is a solid diagnosis.\n\nSafety until you’re evaluated\n- Use showers instead of baths; don’t swim alone; be careful with heights, open flames, or operating machinery.\n- Driving: laws vary, but if there’s any chance of impaired awareness, it’s safest to avoid driving until you’re assessed.\n- Optimize sleep, regular meals, hydration, limit alcohol. Be cautious with high‑THC products; discuss cannabis use with your clinician rather than making abrupt changes.\n\nGo to urgent care/ER if\n- You have a first-time convulsive seizure, an episode lasts more than 5 minutes without recovery, you injure yourself, or you develop new severe headache, fever, stiff neck, weakness, or confusion.\n\nA few questions that help narrow things:\n- During spells, do you stay fully aware and able to speak? Any loss of time, word‑finding trouble, lip smacking, or picking motions?\n- Any odd smells/tastes or a rising sensation from your stomach?\n- Any visual changes (flashing lights, zigzags)?\n- Any link with your period, sleep loss, or cannabis use?\n- Have you ever had an EEG or brain MRI? If yes, when and what were the results?\n\nYou’re not “crazy,” and the feeling like you’re going to die is, unfortunately, a very common part of these spells. They’re real, and they are treatable—getting the right testing is key. If you want, I can help you draft exactly what to tell your doctor to speed up the work‑up.",

    "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what’s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I’m hoping this sub can help me.History:I’ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don’t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I’m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I’ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don’t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn’t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I’m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I’m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they’re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don’t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can’t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I’ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven’t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. Based on what you’ve described, there are a few plausible paths your doctors may want to pursue at the same time. Some of these could overlap.\n\nMost important near-term points\n- Until seizures are ruled out, do not drive, swim alone, work at heights, or operate heavy machinery. Have someone record an episode on video if possible.\n- Avoid all cannabinoids for now. THC/HHC can lower seizure threshold and seem to worsen your episodes. Alcohol and sleep deprivation can also worsen events.\n- Ask your prescriber urgently whether bupropion (Wellbutrin) should be reduced or changed. Bupropion is well known to lower the seizure threshold, and this is especially relevant while you’re having events that may be seizures. Don’t stop suddenly without guidance.\n- Request expedited neurology follow-up for video-EEG monitoring to capture an episode and a brain MRI (with and without contrast, epilepsy protocol). A normal routine EEG does not rule out epilepsy.\n\nLeading possibilities to discuss with your doctors\n1) Focal seizures with dystonic/choreic movements, possibly catamenial (worse around menses)\n- Preserved awareness, episodes lasting minutes, and worsening around your period fit. Routine EEG and CT can be normal; MRI and captured video-EEG are more helpful.\n- Triggers can include cannabinoids and bupropion.\n\n2) Autoimmune disease, especially systemic lupus erythematosus ± antiphospholipid antibodies\n- Fits the combo of fatigue, migratory joint pain, oral ulcers, hair loss, low-grade fevers around menses, and movement episodes that some doctors called chorea. SLE can cause seizures and chorea; antiphospholipid antibodies are a known cause of chorea.\n- Normal rheumatoid factor does not rule out lupus.\n\n3) Behçet disease\n- Recurrent painful oral ulcers, fevers, arthralgia can fit. Ask yourself if you’ve had genital ulcers, eye inflammation/redness, or skin lesions; these would push this higher on the list.\n\n4) Sjögren syndrome or other connective tissue disease overlap\n- Longstanding severe cheilitis/dry lips and mouth sores, fatigue, arthralgia. Ask about dry eyes/mouth, dental issues.\n\n5) Endocrine/metabolic or nutritional contributors\n- Thyroid disease (hypo or hyper), iron deficiency (ferritin), B12/folate deficiency, vitamin D deficiency can contribute to fatigue, hair loss, oral ulcers, and sometimes neurologic symptoms. Low sodium can also provoke seizures.\n\n6) Celiac disease/IBD masquerading as IBS\n- Celiac can cause aphthous ulcers, iron deficiency, fatigue, arthralgia, and neurologic issues (including seizures). IBD can cause oral ulcers and joint pain.\n\n7) Wilson disease (less likely, but important to exclude in young adults with new movement disorder)\n- Check ceruloplasmin, copper studies, slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings.\n\n8) Paroxysmal dyskinesias or a functional neurological disorder (considered only after ruling out the above)\n- Paroxysmal dyskinesias cause episodes of chorea/dystonia with preserved awareness. Functional disorders are common and real, but they’re a diagnosis after appropriate exclusion.\n\nTargeted tests to ask for (some you already have planned)\n- Neurology\n  - Brain MRI with and without contrast (epilepsy protocol).\n  - Prolonged/video-EEG monitoring to capture an event.\n- Autoimmune/rheumatology\n  - ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, C3/C4, ESR/CRP.\n  - Antiphospholipid panel: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, anti–β2-glycoprotein I.\n  - SSA/Ro and SSB/La (Sjögren).\n  - Urinalysis and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio; CMP/creatinine to assess kidney involvement.\n- Hematology/nutrition/endocrine\n  - CBC, ferritin and iron studies, B12, folate, vitamin D.\n  - TSH and free T4 (± thyroid antibodies if abnormal).\n  - Serum sodium and other electrolytes.\n- Celiac/IBD screen\n  - tTG-IgA with total IgA (or deamidated gliadin if IgA deficient).\n  - If GI symptoms worsen, consider fecal calprotectin.\n- Wilson disease screen (if movement disorder persists without another explanation)\n  - Ceruloplasmin, serum copper, 24-hr urine copper; slit-lamp exam.\n- Consider infectious screen if risk factors: HIV, syphilis (these can rarely cause neuro/autoimmune-like issues).\n\nMedication considerations\n- Bupropion: discuss dose and the new seizure-like episodes with your prescriber; many clinicians avoid bupropion if seizures are suspected.\n- Duloxetine: can rarely cause movement symptoms or hyponatremia; check sodium and review for side effects.\n- Avoid metoclopramide in the future given your prior tardive dyskinesia.\n- Avoid cannabinoids for now.\n\nSymptom tracking and patterns\n- Keep a diary logging dates of episodes, menstrual cycle, sleep, stress, illness, medications, and any exposures. If episodes cluster premenstrually, note it; that can guide catamenial seizure management or autoimmune flare patterns.\n- If you can safely record an episode on your phone, the video can be very helpful to neurologists.\n\nSelf-care while workup proceeds\n- Mouth sores: ask about prescription triamcinolone dental paste; check iron/B12/folate; gentle oral care; avoid acidic/spicy foods during flares.\n- Lips: thick emollients (plain petrolatum or lanolin) frequently; consider evaluation for angular cheilitis (sometimes needs antifungal plus mild steroid).\n- Joints: gentle activity, heat/ice, NSAIDs only if your doctors say it’s safe (and not before labs that could be altered by NSAIDs).\n- Hair loss: ask for ferritin, thyroid tests; photos of scalp to monitor changes.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Any episode with loss of consciousness, new weakness, trouble speaking, high fever, stiff neck, severe headache, or an episode lasting >5 minutes without improvement or repeated events without recovery between them.\n\nA few clarifying questions that can help narrow things:\n- Do you get genital ulcers, eye pain/redness, vision changes, skin nodules, or pathergy (skin exaggerated reaction to minor trauma)? Any blood clots or miscarriages? Raynaud’s? Photosensitive rashes?\n- Any dry eyes/mouth or dental issues?\n- Any blood in stool, unintentional weight loss, or persistent diarrhea beyond IBS baseline?\n- What dose/formulation of bupropion are you on (e.g., XL 300 mg)? Any recent dose changes?\n- During episodes: is there an initial warning (aura), asymmetry of movements, eye/head deviation, tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or confusion afterward? Triggers besides edibles (sleep loss, stress, alcohol, sudden movement)?\n- Family history of autoimmune disease, celiac, thyroid disease, or movement disorders?\n\nYou’re doing the right thing pushing for a thorough evaluation. Bringing a concise symptom timeline and the test checklist above to your next neurology and rheumatology visits can speed things up.",

    "question": "I’m 25 with seizures, been seizure free for about 5 years, I’m on 200mg twice a day medication is lamotrigne, I’m a heavy smoker I’m a female I weigh 139lbs I’m 5’6. Can I take shrooms?",
    "answer": "Short answer: I can’t say it’s safe. With a history of seizures, using psilocybin (“shrooms”) carries a real, though hard-to-quantify, risk of provoking a seizure. Most clinical studies with psilocybin exclude people with epilepsy for this reason. I recommend avoiding it and talking with your neurologist first.\n\nKey points for you:\n- Seizure risk: Psychedelics can cause big shifts in blood pressure, heart rate, anxiety, hyperventilation, sleep disruption, and dehydration—common seizure triggers. There are case reports of seizures after psilocybin, especially in people with seizure disorders.\n- Lamotrigine: No known direct dangerous interaction with psilocybin, and serotonin syndrome is unlikely with lamotrigine. But lamotrigine won’t “protect” you from a psychedelic-triggered seizure. Heavy smoking can lower lamotrigine levels slightly; missing doses further increases risk.\n- Consequences: A breakthrough seizure could mean injury, ER visit, and potential loss of driving privileges depending on local laws.\n\nIf you’re considering it anyway (harm-reduction tips, not an endorsement):\n- Discuss with your neurologist first. Ask about your individual risk and whether having a rescue med (e.g., clonazepam or intranasal midazolam) on hand is appropriate.\n- Do not skip or change your lamotrigine dosing. Avoid alcohol, stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines), tramadol, bupropion, dextromethorphan, MAOIs, or other substances that can lower seizure threshold or interact.\n- Sleep well for several nights before and after. Stay well hydrated; eat normally.\n- Use only in a safe setting with a trusted, sober sitter who knows seizure first aid and when to call 911.\n- Avoid high doses. Potency is unpredictable; starting low reduces risk. Never combine with other drugs.\n- If you have a history of status epilepticus, frequent seizures, recent missed doses, or sleep deprivation, don’t do it.\n- Avoid if you or close family have a history of psychosis or bipolar mania, or if you might be pregnant.\n- Be aware of legal status and the risk of misidentified or contaminated mushrooms; some species are deadly.\n\nSeizure first aid (share with your sitter):\n- Time the seizure. Protect from injury, place on side, don’t put anything in the mouth, don’t restrain.\n- Call emergency services if it lasts >5 minutes, repeats without full recovery, there’s injury, or breathing doesn’t normalize.\n\nIf your interest is for mental health reasons, ask your doctor about evidence-based options or clinical trials; many trials still exclude epilepsy, but they can advise you safely.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Your seizure type and last seizure date\n- Any known triggers for you\n- Other meds or substances you use\nI can help estimate relative risk and tailor advice for a discussion with your neurologist.",

    "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy—frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I’d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees—some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as “osteoporosis” (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don’t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",
    "answer": "You’ve got two unusual things starting in your mid‑20s: new‑onset focal seizures and multiple “spontaneous” thoracic compression fractures with a Z‑score −2.4. Even when a lot of labs are “normal,” there are a few important possibilities to consider, and there may be a unifying explanation.\n\nKey possibilities and why they matter\n\n1) Undetected nocturnal generalized seizures causing the vertebral fractures\n- Multiple thoracic wedge compression fractures can occur during generalized tonic‑clonic seizures from intense paraspinal muscle contraction, even without a fall and even in people with only mildly low bone density.\n- Waking from sleep with sudden severe mid‑back pain after a night with no obvious trauma is a classic story.\n- This could mean the fractures are a consequence of seizures rather than primary bone disease (though your Z‑score suggests your bones are also more fragile than ideal).\n\n2) Common but sometimes missed secondary bone causes in young men\n- Low testosterone or functional hypothalamic hypogonadism (sometimes in endurance athletes or with low energy availability) can lower bone density.\n- Celiac disease can cause both low bone density (malabsorption) and is associated with epilepsy (the “celiac‑epilepsy” association).\n- Vitamin D deficiency or phosphate problems (osteomalacia, renal phosphate wasting, or rare tumor‑induced osteomalacia). Serum phosphate is often not checked or is overlooked; you need a fasting level and assessment of renal phosphate handling.\n- Hypercortisolism (Cushing’s), hyperthyroidism, primary hyperparathyroidism. These are standard but important to exclude definitively.\n- Systemic mastocytosis can present in young men with severe osteoporosis and multiple vertebral fractures; screening is a simple serum tryptase.\n- Hypophosphatasia (low alkaline phosphatase) causes fragility fractures in adults and is frequently missed; seizures can occur in infantile forms, but adult disease mainly affects bone and teeth.\n- Rare genetic causes of early‑onset osteoporosis (COL1A1/2, LRP5, WNT1, PLS3, ALPL, etc.) even without family history.\n\n3) Medication contributors\n- SSRIs (including escitalopram) are associated with lower BMD and higher fracture risk; effect size alone is usually modest but could add to risk.\n- Some antiseizure meds worsen bone health (enzyme inducers like phenytoin/carbamazepine; valproate; high‑dose topiramate via metabolic acidosis). If you started any of these around onset, they can compound the problem. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and lacosamide have more favorable bone profiles.\n\nWhat I would make sure has been done or repeat (because details matter)\n\nBone and mineral labs\n- 25‑OH vitamin D; calcium (albumin‑corrected) and ionized calcium; magnesium; phosphorus (fasting); alkaline phosphatase.\n- Parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n- Morning total testosterone (ideally twice), SHBG with calculated free T, LH/FSH, prolactin.\n- TSH and free T4.\n- Celiac screen: tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA (or deamidated gliadin IgG if IgA deficient).\n- If phosphorus is low: urine phosphate and creatinine to calculate tubular reabsorption of phosphate; FGF23; 1,25‑(OH)2 vitamin D.\n- If alkaline phosphatase is low: serum vitamin B6 (PLP) and consider ALPL gene testing (hypophosphatasia).\n- 24‑hour urine calcium (or spot Ca/Cr) to assess calcium handling.\n- Overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late‑night salivary cortisol to exclude Cushing’s.\n- Serum protein electrophoresis with free light chains (screening; myeloma is very unlikely at your age but easy to exclude).\n- Serum tryptase (mastocytosis screen).\n\nNeurologic evaluation\n- Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (if not already).\n- Prolonged/overnight video EEG or ambulatory EEG to look for nocturnal generalized events. Ask a bed partner about nocturnal stiffening/jerks, tongue biting (especially lateral), bed disarray, urinary incontinence, or severe morning myalgias/headache.\n- If generalized seizures are occurring, optimizing seizure control is crucial to prevent new fractures.\n\nBone imaging and management\n- Ensure complete spine imaging to document level and healing trajectory; consider bracing guidance and a spine‑savvy physical therapy plan that avoids loaded spinal flexion while healing.\n- Follow DEXA in 12–18 months on the same machine.\n\nTreatment considerations now\n- Vitamin D repletion to maintain 25‑OH vitamin D around 30–50 ng/mL; typical maintenance 1,000–2,000 IU/day after any loading, adjusted to labs.\n- Calcium intake 1,000–1,200 mg/day total (diet + supplement), preferably diet first.\n- Resistance/strength training focused on hips/legs and posture once the spine is stable; avoid high‑flexion spinal loads until healed.\n- Review antiseizure regimen with neurology to favor bone‑neutral drugs where possible.\n- Discuss SSRI risks/benefits with your prescriber; in some, switching or dose minimization is possible if depression remains well‑controlled by alternatives.\n- Given multiple vertebral fragility fractures at a young age, pharmacologic bone therapy is reasonable even if a clear secondary cause isn’t found. Options:\n  - Anabolic therapy (teriparatide or abaloparatide) can speed vertebral BMD gains and may reduce future vertebral fracture risk; often favored when there are multiple vertebral fractures in younger patients.\n  - Bisphosphonates are effective anti‑resorptives; they persist in bone for years (relevant if family planning or future surgical considerations).\n  - Romosozumab is potent but data in men are more limited; cardiovascular risk needs assessment.\n  These decisions are best made with a metabolic bone specialist.\n\nClues that help target rare causes\n- Any history of childhood fractures, blue sclera, hearing issues, or dentinogenesis imperfecta (suggests osteogenesis imperfecta)?\n- Early tooth loss or dental abnormalities (hypophosphatasia).\n- Diffuse bone pain, proximal muscle weakness, or waddling gait (osteomalacia).\n- GI symptoms, iron deficiency, mouth ulcers, dermatitis herpetiformis (celiac).\n- Flushing, itching, unexplained anaphylaxis, or mixed lytic/sclerotic bone lesions (mastocytosis).\n- Tall/slender with lens dislocation or thrombosis (homocystinuria; check homocysteine/methionine).\n- Episodes of low sodium (SSRIs can cause SIADH; hyponatremia increases fracture risk and can provoke seizures).\n\nWhy your current results might look “mostly normal”\n- Many of the above require very specific tests (fasting phosphate with renal handling, tryptase, celiac serologies, morning and repeated testosterone, low ALP recognition, FGF23), which can be missed in broad but generic panels.\n- Z‑score −2.4 is “below expected for age.” In people under 50, the presence of a fragility fracture itself establishes osteoporosis regardless of BMD.\n\nAction plan to discuss with your doctors\n1) Confirm whether nocturnal generalized seizures are happening (overnight EEG). Tight seizure control to prevent further spine injury.\n2) Ensure the targeted bone workup above is complete; if unrevealing, consider a genetics/metabolic bone clinic for panel testing.\n3) Optimize vitamin D/calcium and begin a supervised, spine‑safe strength program.\n4) Revisit meds with neurology and psychiatry to minimize bone‑negative agents.\n5) Consider starting bone‑active therapy now given the vertebral fracture burden, ideally after excluding contraindications (e.g., avoid teriparatide if ALP is elevated from Paget’s or if any skeletal malignancy is suspected).\n\nIf you can share which tests you’ve already had (with values), which antiseizure medication(s) you’re on, whether anyone has witnessed nocturnal convulsions, and any GI or dental/bone pain symptoms, I can help you and your doctors prioritize next steps.",

    "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this—it’s very understandable to feel anxious after your son’s first tonic‑clonic seizure, especially with travel coming up.\n\nKey points up front\n- After a first unprovoked seizure, the chance of another in the next few months is meaningful (often quoted around 30–50% over 1–2 years, highest early on). His “absent moments” could be seizures, which may increase that risk.\n- You don’t have a diagnosis or rescue medication yet. If the trip is optional and postponing is feasible, staying close to home until he’s been assessed and you have a plan would be a reasonable, low‑risk choice.\n- If you do go, many families travel safely by putting a few safeguards in place. The goal is to reduce triggers, have an emergency plan, and make sure you can get help if needed.\n\nBefore you decide\n- Speak to your GP/paediatric referral team now. Ask:\n  - Can the appointment be expedited given a generalized tonic‑clonic seizure plus possible absences?\n  - Should he start any medication now, or at least have a rescue medication (e.g., buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam) with clear instructions for seizures lasting >5 minutes or clusters?\n  - A brief written seizure action plan.\n- Travel insurance: disclose the recent seizure so cover isn’t invalidated. Make sure you have GHIC/EHIC cards for France.\n\nIf you choose to travel\n- Medical prep:\n  - Carry: seizure action plan, list of current meds/allergies, NHS and GP contacts, and a brief French translation (or app) describing his condition and rescue med if prescribed.\n  - Know emergency numbers: 112 (EU), 15 (SAMU/medical), 18 (fire/rescue). 112 works and can connect you to English-speaking operators.\n  - Pack a timer, soft item to cushion his head, and any rescue medication.\n- Minimise triggers:\n  - Prioritise regular sleep (most important), good hydration, meals on time. Avoid illness exposure where possible.\n  - Limit prolonged screen time/flashing lights; sunglasses/hat can help with sunlight flicker through trees when driving.\n- Car and travel safety:\n  - He should sit belted in the back. Plan extra rest stops so he’s not sleep‑deprived.\n  - If a seizure occurs in the car: pull over safely, protect his head, do not put anything in his mouth, time it, place him on his side once jerking stops, and call 112 if it lasts >5 minutes, repeats, or you’re concerned.\n- Accommodation and activities:\n  - Ground‑floor bed (no top bunks), showers instead of baths, don’t lock the bathroom door.\n  - Someone within earshot at night initially; keep the bedroom hazard‑free.\n  - Swimming only with close, constant supervision (ideally 1:1 in the water); no hot tubs; life jacket for boating; avoid heights, open flames, and unsupervised cycling on roads for now.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now (even before travel)\n- Another seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, injury during a seizure, breathing problems, persistent confusion >1–2 hours, severe headache, fever, stiff neck, or head trauma.\n\nIs cancelling “medically necessary”?\n- There’s no absolute rule that you must cancel after a first seizure, but given the recent generalized seizure, the possible ongoing absence seizures, and the remote location, postponing is a reasonable and cautious option—many clinicians would support that if it reduces risk and anxiety until you’ve had an evaluation and a plan.\n- If postponement isn’t practical and you can implement the precautions above—especially getting rescue medication and a clear action plan from your GP—travel can still be done safely.\n\nTrusted resources (UK)\n- Epilepsy Action helpline and travel advice: epilepsy.org.uk\n- Epilepsy Society: epilepsysociety.org.uk\n\nIf you’d like, tell me more about the “absent moments” (what they look like, how long, how often) and I can help you draft a simple seizure action plan to discuss with your GP before you travel.",

    "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn’t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can’t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can’t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
    "answer": "Short answer: In a 22-year-old non-smoker with two clean-catch urinalyses showing persistent microscopic blood but no symptoms, this is usually low risk. The typical next steps are to confirm it’s real and not contamination, screen for kidney (glomerular) causes, and, if needed, do a simple imaging study. Cancer workup (like cystoscopy) is generally not indicated at your age unless there are red flags.\n\nWhat your clinician will likely do next\n- Confirm the result:\n  - Repeat a clean-catch urinalysis with microscopy (ideally after avoiding vigorous exercise and sex for 48–72 hours). Ensure careful perineal cleaning; using a tampon during collection can reduce vaginal contamination.\n  - If available, ask the lab to report RBCs per high-power field and look for dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts.\n- Check for kidney involvement:\n  - Urine albumin/creatinine ratio or protein/creatinine ratio (proteinuria raises concern for glomerular disease).\n  - Basic metabolic panel for creatinine/eGFR and a blood pressure check.\n- Imaging (if it persists or if there’s a history suggesting stones):\n  - Renal–bladder ultrasound is the usual first choice in low-risk young patients to look for stones or structural issues. CT is rarely needed unless stone suspicion is high or ultrasound is inconclusive.\n- Who to see next:\n  - Nephrology referral if there’s protein in the urine, abnormal kidney function, high blood pressure, or abnormal RBC morphology/casts (suggesting a kidney/glomerular cause like IgA nephropathy or thin basement membrane disease).\n  - Urology referral and cystoscopy are usually not needed at your age unless there’s gross (visible) blood, very high-risk features, or persistent unexplained hematuria after initial evaluation.\n\nWhy this is likely benign for you\n- At 22, the risk of urinary tract cancer is extremely low.\n- Common benign causes include prior stone passage, exercise-induced hematuria, minor urethral/gynecologic contamination, thin basement membrane (benign familial) hematuria, or low-grade irritation.\n- Lithium is unlikely to be the cause here since the first abnormal UA was before starting it. Lithium monitoring is still important for kidney function over time.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- If another UA is ordered: hydrate normally, avoid strenuous exercise and sex for 48–72 hours beforehand, and provide a careful midstream clean-catch sample.\n- Share any relevant history at your visit: recent hard exercise, stone history, family history of kidney disease/hematuria, hearing loss (Alport), recent infections, or new meds/supplements.\n- Continue your prescribed meds; don’t stop lithium because of this finding.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Visible blood or clots in urine, severe flank pain, fever, burning urination, inability to urinate, or swelling/shortness of breath.\n\nIf you can share the full UA details (specific gravity, protein, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, pH, and microscopy findings), I can help interpret them while you wait for your appointment.",

    "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
    "answer": "Short answer: what you describe is not typical for an epileptic seizure. Seizures from flashing lights are usually brief (seconds–minutes), often stop once the light is removed, and are followed by a short period of confusion or sleepiness. A 5‑hour episode of dizziness, shaking, nausea/vomiting, feeling cold/numb is more consistent with:\n- A visually triggered migraine or vestibular migraine\n- Visually induced motion sickness (from fast, bright, flickering patterns)\n- A panic/anxiety response with hyperventilation\nLess commonly, other causes like inner ear problems, dehydration, low blood sugar, or infections can do this. Family history and a normal EEG at 15 do not rule out epilepsy forever, but your description makes epilepsy less likely.\n\nWhat to do now\n- If you’re currently better: hydrate, eat small bland meals, rest.\n- Avoid flashing/strobe lights for now. If you can’t avoid them, use tinted lenses (FL‑41 or similar), look away, cover one eye, and take frequent breaks.\n- Keep a symptom diary: what you were doing, lighting, sleep, stress, caffeine/alcohol, food, menstrual cycle/hormone treatment, duration, and all symptoms.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Another event with loss of consciousness, stiffening/jerking, tongue bite, or incontinence.\n- A seizure/convulsion lasting more than 5 minutes (call emergency services).\n- Severe “worst ever” headache, neck stiffness/fever, new weakness/vision or speech changes, chest pain, fainting with injury, or persistent confusion.\n- Ongoing vomiting you can’t keep fluids down, signs of dehydration (very dark urine, dizziness on standing), or symptoms lasting beyond 24 hours.\n\nNext steps (non-urgent but prompt)\n- See your primary care clinician, and consider a neurology referral.\n- Ask about:\n  - Migraine or vestibular migraine (especially if you had light sensitivity, visual aura, or a subsequent headache).\n  - An EEG with photic stimulation (and possibly pattern stimulation) to reassess photosensitivity.\n  - Further tests only if your exam/history suggests it (e.g., MRI, labs such as glucose, electrolytes, thyroid).\n  - Acute migraine treatments (NSAIDs, anti‑nausea meds; triptans if appropriate) and preventive strategies.\n- Bring a witness description if anyone saw the episode.\n\nMedication note\n- “Normocis” (often an inositol-based supplement for hormonal/PCOS issues) and probiotics like Yovis are not known to trigger seizures. Inositol can sometimes cause mild GI upset but wouldn’t explain your full episode.\n\nA few questions that help narrow this down\n- Did you have loss of awareness, confusion afterward, tongue biting, or incontinence?\n- Was there a headache before, during, or after? Light or sound sensitivity? Visual aura?\n- Any spinning sensation (vertigo) or motion sensitivity?\n- Were you sleep‑deprived, fasting, dehydrated, or using alcohol/cannabis/other substances?\n- Do bright lights or screen flicker usually bother you?\n\nIf you notice episodes with loss of awareness or blackouts, avoid driving, swimming alone, heights, or operating machinery until you’ve been evaluated.",

    "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through all of this, especially while your husband is also in the hospital. What you’ve described is serious, and you deserve a coordinated plan with clear next steps. I’ll answer your questions directly and then outline what to do now.\n\n1) Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures?\n- Uncontrolled generalized tonic-clonic seizures do increase the risk of injury, aspiration, status epilepticus, and SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy).\n- Average SUDEP risk across all people with epilepsy is about 1 in 1000 per year. With frequent generalized tonic‑clonic seizures, especially in clusters or at night, the risk is several times higher (roughly 6–10 per 1000 per year in some refractory groups). Your recent aspiration and ICU course are red flags that your personal risk is higher than average.\n- The single most effective way to lower risk is to stop or markedly reduce tonic‑clonic seizures. Good adherence, rescue meds for clusters, nighttime supervision/monitoring, and treating sleep and breathing problems all help.\n\n2) Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery for Chiari 1 with a syrinx?\n- Yes, many people with symptomatic Chiari I and a syrinx are candidates for posterior fossa decompression. The goals are to restore CSF flow, reduce or eliminate the syrinx, and prevent progressive spinal cord injury. In large series, the syrinx shrinks and symptoms improve in most patients.\n- Indications typically include: progressive neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, imbalance, hand dysfunction), intractable Chiari headaches (often cough/strain‑triggered), brainstem/cerebellar signs, and/or a syrinx that is symptomatic or enlarging.\n\n3) Can Chiari decompression control the epilepsy?\n- It’s very unlikely. Chiari I and syrinx are not typical causes of frontal lobe epilepsy, and your seizures starting in Broca’s area point to a cortical focus in the frontal lobe. Decompression may help Chiari‑related symptoms but is not a treatment for frontal‑lobe seizures.\n\n4) How much should I worry about SUDEP?\n- Given your frequent tonic‑clonic seizures, clusters, and a recent aspiration/intubation, your SUDEP risk is meaningfully higher than average. That deserves prompt action, but there are concrete steps that reduce risk:\n  - Eliminate or reduce tonic‑clonic seizures through specialized epilepsy care (see below).\n  - Take antiseizure medications exactly as prescribed; don’t miss doses.\n  - Have a home rescue plan: intranasal midazolam (Nayzilam) or diazepam (Valtoco) at the first sign of a prolonged seizure or cluster.\n  - Nighttime safety: someone nearby if possible; use a seizure‑alert device (e.g., wrist‑worn or arm‑band devices validated for tonic‑clonic seizures), keep the door open, consider a monitor. Sleep on your side rather than prone.\n  - Avoid alcohol and sleep deprivation; treat sleep apnea if present.\n  - Keep a written seizure action plan and ensure family/friends know what to do.\n\n5) What do I do now?\n- Urgent referral to a Level 3–4 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center:\n  - You meet criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy (failure of 2 appropriately chosen medications).\n  - Ask for inpatient video‑EEG monitoring to capture events, high‑resolution 3T MRI with epilepsy protocol, and possibly PET/SPECT and neuropsychological testing.\n  - Depending on findings, options include:\n    - Resective surgery or laser ablation if a safe, well‑defined focus is found.\n    - Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) targeting the frontal focus, even near language cortex, using careful mapping.\n    - Deep brain stimulation (DBS, anterior nucleus of thalamus) or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) if resection isn’t possible.\n    - These treatments often cut seizures by 50–80% and reduce clusters and hospitalizations.\n  - Review medication options you haven’t tried or combinations/dosing. For focal epilepsy, drugs like cenobamate, brivaracetam, perampanel, lacosamide, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and clobazam are commonly used; many patients benefit from optimization at a specialty center.\n  - Because your seizures are “monthly,” discuss catamenial epilepsy. If they track your cycle, targeted strategies (e.g., short‑term clobazam or acetazolamide around menses, or progesterone‑based therapy) can reduce clusters.\n\n- Get a rescue medication and written plan now:\n  - Ask your neurologist today for intranasal midazolam or diazepam, with clear instructions: give if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, or if you have back‑to‑back seizures without full recovery, or at the start of your typical cluster.\n  - If a seizure continues 5 minutes after rescue, call EMS.\n\n- Nighttime and living‑alone safety while your husband is hospitalized:\n  - Arrange check‑ins or have someone stay the night if possible.\n  - Use a validated seizure‑detection device; keep phone accessible; set up a baby monitor or smart speaker to call for help.\n  - Sleep on your side; consider wedge pillows to avoid prone position.\n\n- Chiari and syrinx:\n  - See a neurosurgeon who routinely treats Chiari I with syringomyelia. Bring your latest MRI. If you have progressive symptoms attributable to the syrinx or classic Chiari features, decompression can be very helpful for those issues. Coordinate care so your epilepsy and Chiari teams are both aware of the full picture.\n\n- Mental health and support:\n  - Anxiety, trauma, and depression are common with refractory epilepsy. Ask for counseling support. The Epilepsy Foundation can connect you with resources and local support groups.\n  - If driving, stop until cleared; this protects you and others and is legally required in most places.\n\nRed flags that need urgent care:\n- Seizure lasting >5 minutes or repeated seizures without recovery.\n- New or worsening weakness, numbness, gait changes, or bladder/bowel issues (could indicate syrinx progression).\n- Fever, severe headache with neck stiffness, or persistent vomiting.\n\nIf you share your city/region, I can help you find a nearby Level 4 epilepsy center and a Chiari‑experienced neurosurgeon. Also let me know which antiseizure meds you’ve tried and whether seizures line up with your menstrual cycle—those details can guide next steps. You’re dealing with a lot, but there are real options that can lower your risk and improve control. You shouldn’t have to live in fear of the next cluster.",

    "question": "i’m currently living with my mom 60F who has had epilepsy for the past 30-ish years. i’ve noticed her memory is declining, especially in the past year or so. it’s not to the point where there could be any sort of formal diagnosis given but it’s starting to concern me. i’ve done some research into the correlation between epilepsy and alzheimer’s (or dementia in general) and from what i’ve gathered the strongest correlation is between focal epilepsy and alzheimer’s due to the damage to the temporal lobe. my mom has tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) and i’ve been trying to find information on how much her seizures affect the temporal lobe, but i can’t find much and i think that’s partially due to the lack of research. i don’t know who to ask or talk to about this. i don’t want to scare my mom but i’ve scoured google trying to find more information but i can’t seem to find anything. i just have so many questions…is 60 too early to tell? once her memory starts to decline, how long does she have still being lucid? do grand mal seizures damage the temporal lobe in the same way focal seizures do? if that is what’s happening, how do i make her feel loved and comfortable? examples of her memory issues: forgetting what she’s talking about mid sentence (a lot). forgetting the names of people/places/things that she knows well. misplacing/forgetting objects fairly frequently, etc. i don’t except anyone to know all the answers, but any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.EDIT: i understand with age there’s usually going to be some forgetfulness, but this seems excessive to me. i’m obviously not a professional, just a paranoid daughter, but my father is older and his memory is far better. also, more background: 60F, 5’2, 120lbs, past history of estrogen binding cancer (has had double mastectomy + hysterectomy); she fractured her neck following a seizure in 2017? i’m not sure which vertebre, but she’s made a full recovery. also she’s had her left? hip replaced and currently suffers with nerve pain. on my maternal side, there’s a lot of history of mental illness (including: BP-1 & 2, schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, major depression, BPD, ASPD, anxiety & panic disorders & some substance abuse - mostly heroin and meth) my mom is only formally diagnosed with clinical depression, and is on medication for both the epilepsy as well as depression. medications include lexapro & lamotrigine (she also briefly was using \"speed\" which she swears wasn’t meth but there’s a good chance it was)",
    "answer": "You’re a thoughtful daughter, and your concerns are reasonable. Memory change at 60 deserves a proper look—especially with a long history of epilepsy—because there are both reversible causes and conditions we want to catch early.\n\nBig picture\n- Epilepsy and dementia are linked, but the relationship is complex and not destiny. People with epilepsy have a higher-than-average risk of later-life cognitive problems (roughly 1.5–3x in studies), and Alzheimer’s disease increases the risk of seizures. Good seizure control and managing other health factors can reduce risk.\n- “Grand mal” (generalized tonic–clonic) describes what a seizure looks like, not where it starts. Many “grand mal” seizures actually begin focally (often in the temporal lobe) and then generalize (called focal-to-bilateral tonic–clonic). So it’s possible the temporal lobe is involved even if you’ve only heard “grand mal.”\n- Generalized tonic–clonic seizures themselves don’t specifically target the temporal lobe. However, frequent uncontrolled seizures, very prolonged seizures (status epilepticus), head injuries during seizures, hypoxia, sleep deprivation, and certain meds/substances can all affect memory. Temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis are particularly associated with memory impairment.\n- Age 60 is not “too early.” Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-onset dementia can be diagnosed before 65. Many non-dementia causes can mimic or worsen memory (depression, sleep disorders, vitamin deficiency, thyroid issues, medication effects, hearing loss, substance use), and addressing these can help.\n\nWhat you can do now\n1) Book appointments (primary care and neurologist/epileptologist). Ask for:\n   - Clarification of seizure type: Is it primary generalized or focal-to-bilateral? Consider an EEG and brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (look at hippocampi/temporal lobes).\n   - Cognitive screening and a baseline: MoCA (or Mini-Cog) in clinic; referral for full neuropsychological testing to document strengths/weaknesses and track over time.\n   - Lab work to rule out reversible contributors:\n     - CBC, CMP (check sodium—SSRIs can cause low sodium), TSH, vitamin B12 (+/− folate), fasting glucose/HbA1c, lipids, vitamin D. Consider HIV/syphilis serology if risk. Urinalysis if acute confusion episodes.\n   - Medication review for cognitive side effects:\n     - Lamotrigine is generally “cognition-friendly.”\n     - Watch for benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines (diphenhydramine), bladder meds, muscle relaxants, topiramate/zonisamide, high-dose gabapentin/pregabalin—these can impair memory.\n     - SSRIs rarely can cause hyponatremia and fogginess; depression itself impairs concentration—optimize treatment.\n   - Sleep evaluation: screen for sleep apnea (STOP-BANG) and insomnia. Untreated OSA worsens memory and seizure control.\n   - Mood/anxiety screening (PHQ-9/GAD-7). “Depressive pseudodementia” can look like memory loss but improves with treatment.\n   - Hearing and vision checks—treating deficits can meaningfully help cognition and communication.\n\n2) Tighten seizure management\n   - Ensure strict medication adherence and adequate sleep; avoid alcohol and all stimulants (including “speed”/meth) as they lower seizure threshold and damage cognition.\n   - Keep a seizure and memory diary (note seizures, sleep, stress, meds, and “bad memory days”).\n   - If interictal epileptiform discharges are frequent on EEG, some treatment adjustments can improve day-to-day cognition.\n\n3) Daily supports that help memory now\n   - Consistent routines; one “home” spot for wallet/keys/phone; labels on drawers; large calendar and whiteboard; smartphone reminders/voice assistants; pill organizer with alarms; automatic medication refills.\n   - Reduce clutter; good lighting; fall-prevention measures; medical ID bracelet; shower grab bars.\n   - Gentle communication: one question at a time, allow extra time, avoid “testing” her memory, and use reassurance.\n\n4) How to bring this up without scaring her\n   - Use “I” statements: “I’ve noticed some changes and I’d feel better if we got a baseline checkup.” Emphasize common, treatable causes and that a baseline helps track progress. Offer to go with her.\n\nAnswers to your specific questions\n- Is 60 too early to tell? No. We can screen for MCI now and look for reversible causes. Early evaluation helps.\n- How long will she stay lucid if this is dementia? There’s no single timeline. Some people with MCI stay stable for years or improve if contributing factors are treated. If a neurodegenerative condition is found, progression varies; early treatment and risk-factor control can slow decline.\n- Do grand mal (tonic–clonic) seizures damage the temporal lobe like focal seizures? Not typically in the same way. Temporal lobe damage is more tied to seizures that start in the temporal lobe (mesial temporal/hippocampal sclerosis) or to prolonged/frequent seizures, head injury, and hypoxia. An MRI and EEG help clarify.\n- How to make her feel loved and comfortable? Keep routines predictable, reduce demands when she’s tired, focus on successes, avoid correcting small mistakes, keep social activities she enjoys, and celebrate normalcy. Encourage physical activity, social connection, and a Mediterranean-style diet—these support brain health.\n\nRed flags that need urgent care\n- New focal neurologic deficits (speech, weakness, vision changes), a big stepwise decline, severe confusion over hours to days, fever, head injury, or a seizure lasting >5 minutes or repeated seizures without recovery—call emergency services.\n\nGiven her history\n- Longstanding epilepsy, prior serious injury with a seizure, depression, possible stimulant exposure, and current SSRI use all make a careful, holistic review important.\n- If she ever had “auras,” déjà vu, rising epigastric sensations, or brief spells of staring/confusion, mention these—they suggest temporal lobe involvement.\n- Ask the neurologist specifically: “Could these be focal-to-bilateral seizures? What do her EEGs and MRI show about the temporal lobes/hippocampi?”\n\nResources\n- Alzheimer’s Association Helpline (24/7): 1-800-272-3900 (US). They can also connect you to local memory clinics and caregiver resources.\n- Epilepsy Foundation Helpline: 1-800-332-1000; seizure first-aid and caregiver support.\n- Consider a local memory clinic or a neuropsychologist for baseline testing.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a short message to her doctor listing the concerns and the specific tests to request, or help you build a simple daily memory-support plan tailored to her routines.",

    "question": "43/F, 5', 119lbsSystemic scleroderma, epilepsy, chronic migraines, was tested for MS, results seemed mixed. Some of the specialists felt strongly that I had it, others said I didnt. There were white spots on my brain but maybe that was migraines.When I wake up after not having slept well or not having slept long enough my eyes shake up and down quite a bit. It lasts for a few minutes until I'm up and moving around. Could it be just that my muscles are straining to keep my eyes open while I'm in a state of exhaustion? This has been going on for a few years.Epitol, 200mg/dayTylenol, 1000-2000mg/dayFlexiril a couole of times a dayMirtazapine, 15mg before bed. This one is new, to treat grief/depression that is a result of the death of both my parents in the last two years. Was also havig. Sleep seizures during the depression but they are gone now.Thanks for any input.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, and for your losses.\n\nWhat you describe—your eyes moving up and down for a few minutes after a poor night’s sleep—sounds more like nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), not “muscles straining” to keep your eyelids open. Eyelid fatigue causes eyelid twitching (myokymia), but the eyeball doesn’t move. Vertical nystagmus (up–down) is usually a central nervous system sign and deserves a closer look, especially with your neurologic history.\n\nCommon possibilities to consider\n- Medication effect: anticonvulsants (including carbamazepine/Epitol), sedating muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine/Flexeril), and other sedatives can cause or unmask nystagmus, especially with sleep deprivation or at peak blood levels.\n- Vestibular migraine can cause transient nystagmus, often worse with fatigue/poor sleep.\n- Brainstem/cerebellar causes (less common but important): MS, Chiari malformation, stroke, structural lesions; vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause nystagmus.\n- Less likely given your pattern: seizure-related eye movements (usually brief and not limited to waking), eyelid twitching (doesn’t move the pupil), or opsoclonus (chaotic movements in all directions, usually with other symptoms).\n\nWhy now/why mornings\n- Sleep deprivation and fatigue can bring out or worsen nystagmus.\n- Drug timing matters. Carbamazepine peaks ~4–8 hours after a dose; if you take it at night, early-morning levels may be highest. Cyclobenzaprine and mirtazapine add sedation and can accentuate gaze-evoked nystagmus.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Try to capture a short video during an episode (have someone film your eyes with good light). This is extremely helpful for your neurologist/neuro‑ophthalmologist.\n- Clarify what you feel: does the world appear to bounce up and down (oscillopsia)? Is it both eyes? Any vertigo, imbalance, new double vision, slurred speech, or limb weakness?\n- Medication review with your neurologist:\n  - Check a carbamazepine trough level and basic labs (CMP, sodium). Consider adjusting dosing time/splitting dose to avoid early-morning peaks if appropriate.\n  - Reassess the need and frequency of cyclobenzaprine; it can worsen nystagmus and sedation when combined with carbamazepine and mirtazapine.\n  - Avoid alcohol or sedating antihistamines near bedtime.\n- Testing worth discussing if not done recently:\n  - Neuro‑ophthalmology exam (eye movement testing).\n  - MRI brain with attention to brainstem/cerebellum; consider cervical/foramen magnum imaging if occipital/valsalva‑triggered headaches suggest Chiari.\n  - Labs: vitamin B12, TSH, magnesium; carbamazepine level as above.\n  - If there’s any concern for vestibular migraine, a migraine-focused plan can help (sleep, triggers, preventives).\n  - If episodes ever coincide with other seizure signs, consider a sleep‑deprived or ambulatory EEG.\n- Sleep: prioritize consistent, adequate sleep; dehydration, caffeine excess, and missed meals can worsen both migraine and eye movement instability.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or persistent vertical nystagmus not limited to waking, severe vertigo or imbalance, new double vision, facial droop, slurred speech, weakness/numbness, or a sudden severe headache. These can indicate a brainstem/cerebellar problem.\n\nAbout the MRI “white spots”\n- Migraines commonly cause small, nonspecific white matter spots. MS lesions tend to have characteristic locations (periventricular “Dawson’s fingers,” juxtacortical, infratentorial, corpus callosum) and evolve over time. A neuroradiology review and clinical correlation matter more than a single scan result. Vertical nystagmus can occur with MS if the brainstem/cerebellum is involved, but your morning-only, fatigue‑linked episodes also fit medication/fatigue/vestibular migraine patterns.\n\nA few quick questions that would help:\n- Do both eyes move, and does the world look like it’s bouncing?\n- Any vertigo or imbalance with the episodes?\n- When do you take your carbamazepine and cyclobenzaprine? Have you ever had a carbamazepine level checked?\n- When was your last brain MRI, and was the brainstem/cerebellum specifically assessed?\n- Any neck/occipital headaches worse with coughing/straining?\n\nIf you can share those details, I can help you and your doctor target the next steps more precisely.",

    "question": "Bipolar, OCD, TL Epilepsy (I am questioning this, diagnosed with absence seizures but I don’t think this fits) 200mg Topamax 2x daily, 200mg sertraline, 3mg risperidone, 30mg abilify, 1000IU vitamin D, 40mg somac, I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was around 17-18, but my neurologist just doesn’t really listen to me. He diagnosed me with absence seizures but the problem is I’ve never forgotten a seizure or lost consciousness. Now I’m realising that what he’s called my ‘motor tics’ could be seizures as well. Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I’m off my meds. But the past week I haven’t really been sleeping and I’ve had the flu and I’ve been unable to twitch and it’s like the feeling is building up in the back of my head and its getting really uncomfortable and making it sometimes hard to breathe. Sometimes painful. The feeling is completely involuntary, kind of like a sneeze, and it feels like when you can’t sneeze. What should I do? My neurologist doesn’t listen to me. I have a GP appointment in 2 days, should I talk to her about it?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, especially when you don’t feel heard. Yes—bring this up with your GP in 2 days, and ask for a focused re‑evaluation. In the meantime, don’t stop or change any meds on your own.\n\nWhy this matters now\n- Sleep loss, illness/fever, and missed doses can all worsen both seizures and tic disorders.\n- Your description—an internal “build-up,” temporary suppressibility, relief after the jerk/grunt, worse with stress/sleep loss—sounds more like motor/vocal tics than absence seizures. Absence seizures usually involve brief impaired awareness and are not suppressible, and people typically don’t feel a “need” to do them.\n- That said, focal seizures and myoclonus can look similar, and long-term antipsychotics or SSRIs can also cause movement symptoms (tics, myoclonus, dystonia). You’re on two antipsychotics (risperidone + aripiprazole), which increases the chance of movement side effects.\n\nWhat to ask your GP for\n- A second opinion referral:\n  - Epileptologist (seizure specialist) for video-EEG/ambulatory EEG monitoring to capture events.\n  - Or a movement-disorder neurologist for evaluation of tics vs dystonia/myoclonus.\n- A medication review with neurology and psychiatry:\n  - Reassess the need for both risperidone and aripiprazole.\n  - Screen for extrapyramidal side effects or tardive syndromes.\n  - Ensure your topiramate dose and timing are optimized; confirm no missed doses.\n- Consider behavioral therapy for tics (CBIT/Habit Reversal), which can help the premonitory urge/“build-up.”\n- Basic labs if not recent (electrolytes, renal function, vitamin D level; others as your GP feels appropriate).\n\nBring helpful info to the visit\n- A short video of an episode (ask someone to record).\n- A 1–2 week diary: time of day, trigger (stress, illness, missed sleep), ability to suppress, awareness, duration, any confusion afterward, tongue-biting, incontinence, injuries.\n- Current medication list with doses and any recent changes.\n\nSafety and self-care now\n- Prioritize sleep and hydration; treat fever with acetaminophen/paracetamol as needed.\n- Avoid alcohol and stimulants; be cautious with cold medicines—decongestants (pseudoephedrine) and dextromethorphan can aggravate tics or lower seizure threshold.\n- Until clarified, avoid high-risk activities (heights, swimming alone, operating heavy machinery; consider avoiding driving if jerks could occur while driving).\n- If an urge builds, try competing responses (gentle isometric neck press into a headrest, slow diaphragmatic breathing) to reduce the intensity safely.\n\nGo to urgent care/ED now if\n- Jerks or spasms cause significant or persistent trouble breathing; lips/face turn blue; chest pain.\n- A seizure lasts >5 minutes, or repeated events without full recovery.\n- New confusion, fainting, severe headache, new weakness, or injury.\n\nYou’re doing the right thing by seeking help. If your GP agrees, a second-opinion referral for video-EEG and a movement-disorder assessment is very reasonable, and a coordinated med review could meaningfully reduce these symptoms.",

    "question": "Age 35, Sex F, Height 5’2”, Weight 135Trying to keep this short and sweet, but can provide infinite additional information/context if requested. I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I’ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv… and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by…-Strange ‘out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain’ feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by…-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by…-both hands very tingly….And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn’t really seem like any kind of seizure I’ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don’t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse. So uh… yeah.Thoughts? Feelings? I briefly caught part of it on video, but have no idea how to post that here.I greatly appreciate any input.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you were brushed off. What you describe deserves a careful work‑up, not a one‑line answer.\n\nKey points from your description\n- Recurrent, stereotyped sequence over ~1 hour: right eye flutter/closure → brief “near‑syncope/out‑of‑body” feeling → right‑leg jerks → bilateral hand tingling → brief return to baseline; later added right facial numbness/twitch and transient speech change.\n- Mostly preserved awareness; each phase ~30 seconds; cycles repeat.\n- Preceded by occipital/upper‑neck pain.\n- Normal “routine” EEG between spells (or not recorded during an actual spell).\n\nWhy a normal EEG doesn’t settle this\n- A routine EEG is often normal in people with true focal epileptic seizures, especially if no event was captured. Diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) should ideally be made by video‑EEG capturing a typical spell showing no epileptic EEG change and semiology consistent with PNES.\n\nWhat could be going on (high‑level differential)\n- Focal seizures with awareness (left hemisphere/frontal involvement can cause right face/eye and right leg motor symptoms; clusters are common; the sequence sounds stereotyped).\n- PNES/functional neurological events (long overall duration, waxing/waning, eye closure can fit) — but this should be confirmed with video‑EEG during a typical spell.\n- Migraine aura/hemiplegic migraine (motor/sensory/speech symptoms, often with posterior head/neck pain) — timing here is a bit atypical but worth considering.\n- Paroxysmal neurologic symptoms from demyelinating disease (e.g., MS) or cervical/brainstem pathology, given occipital/cervical pain.\n- Vascular: limb‑shaking TIA (usually with carotid disease; less likely but not impossible).\n- Autoimmune/inflammatory (given your significant hilar lymph node, sarcoidosis/neurosarcoidosis is on the list even with a negative needle biopsy).\n\nWhat to ask for now (while you’re still in care)\n- Capture a typical spell on video‑EEG:\n  - Request continuous video‑EEG monitoring for 24–72 hours, with staff alerted to come record if you feel a spell starting; use the event button.\n  - If monitoring isn’t available now, ask how to arrange an outpatient EMU admission promptly.\n- Brain and cervical spine MRI with and without contrast; consider MRA head/neck if vascular concern.\n- Basic labs: glucose, electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg), CBC, TSH, B12; consider ESR/CRP.\n- Given the hilar lymph node: discuss targeted work‑up for sarcoidosis/neurosarcoidosis (chest CT/PET if not done, repeat tissue diagnosis if suspicion remains, serum ACE/soluble IL‑2 receptor—recognizing limited specificity—and, if neuro signs persist, consider lumbar puncture after MRI).\n- If they believe PNES: ask them to document it by capturing a typical event on video‑EEG and to offer treatment (education plus referral for FND‑informed therapy), not just reassurance.\n\nSafety until clarified\n- Seizure precautions: no driving, swimming alone, heights, or baths; showers only; avoid operating dangerous machinery.\n- If an episode lasts >5 minutes, occurs back‑to‑back without recovery, or you develop persistent weakness, facial droop, severe headache, new speech trouble, fever/stiff neck, chest pain, or true syncope, seek urgent care immediately.\n\nPractical tips\n- Keep recording spells on your phone; note time, triggers, sequence, which side is involved, ability to follow commands, and recovery.\n- Bring the video to rounds; ask for the attending (or an epileptologist) to review it with you.\n- If you feel dismissed, request a second neurology opinion or ask to involve patient relations.\n\nIf you can share more context (what imaging you’ve had, exact EEG type/duration, meds/supplements, migraine history, autoimmune symptoms, family history), I can help you target the next steps further.",

    "answer": "I’m sorry this is worrying—these kinds of episodes are unsettling to watch. A normal 4‑hour EEG doesn’t completely rule out epilepsy, but many non‑epileptic conditions in kids can look seizure‑like. From what you describe (brief eye squeezing with head shaking “like tasting something sour”), several possibilities come to mind:\n\nCommon benign possibilities\n- Motor tics: Very common in childhood. Eye squeezing and head jerks are classic. Tics are brief, can wax and wane, often increase with stress or fatigue, and kids can sometimes suppress them or they pause with distraction. Awareness is preserved. EEG is typically normal.\n- Shuddering attacks (benign): Brief shiver/tremor of the head/upper body, sometimes with facial grimace or eye closure. Often happen with excitement or during/after eating. No loss of awareness; resolve on their own.\n- Stereotypies: Repetitive movements (e.g., head shaking) often triggered by excitement or boredom. More common in younger kids and in neurodevelopmental conditions; awareness intact.\n- Reflux-related posturing (Sandifer): If episodes cluster around feeds and include head/neck posturing, grimacing, or arching.\n\nThings that would make epilepsy more likely\n- Impaired awareness (staring, not responding) during the event\n- Rhythmic, repetitive jerking not distractible or suppressible\n- Eyelid flutter with brief “blanking out” many times a day, light sensitivity (eyelid myoclonia)\n- Events during sleep\n- Confusion, sleepiness, headache, or behavior change after episodes\n\nLess likely\n- Teething: Can cause drooling, gum pain, and irritability, but not typically repeated eye squeezing and head-shaking episodes.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Capture clear videos of several events (face and whole body), and note:\n  - Duration and frequency\n  - Triggers (excitement, eating, screens, tiredness)\n  - Whether he can pause/stop with distraction or by asking him to do a task\n  - Whether he’s aware and can follow a simple command during it\n  - If they ever occur during sleep\n- Share the videos and notes with his neurologist. Given the prior seizure, they may suggest longer video‑EEG monitoring or a sleep‑deprived EEG if concern remains.\n- If episodes cluster around feeding or there’s arching/spitting up, mention reflux symptoms. If there’s persistent eye wobbling (nystagmus), head tilt, or unusual head bobbing in a younger child, ask about an eye exam.\n\nSeek urgent care now if\n- An event lasts longer than 5 minutes or repeats without recovery\n- There’s blue/gray color, breathing trouble, injury, or he doesn’t return to baseline\n- New weakness, severe headache, repeated vomiting, or a big change in behavior or alertness\n\nA few questions to help narrow this down:\n- How old is your son now, and when did these new episodes start?\n- About how long does each episode last, and how often are they happening?\n- Is he aware and responsive during them? Can he stop if you call his name or ask him to do something?\n- Do they happen more with excitement, eating, or screens? Do they ever happen in sleep?\n- Any other symptoms (reflux/heartburn, nystagmus/eye shaking, headaches, developmental changes)?\n- Any family history of tics, migraine, or epilepsy?\n\nIf you can share those details (and ideally a video with your neurologist), it will help distinguish between tics/shuddering attacks and seizures and guide whether more testing is needed.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency ß-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",
    "answer": "Short answer: Your EEG has some features that can be seen in people with focal (often temporal lobe) epilepsy, but it is not a diagnosis by itself. The referral to an epilepsy specialist is appropriate to sort out whether your spells are seizures and what to do next.\n\nWhat the report means in plain language\n- Background 10 c/s activity over the back of the head: That’s the normal “alpha” rhythm most awake people have.\n- Incomplete reactivity to eye opening: A minor, nonspecific finding; can happen with drowsiness or technical factors.\n- Beta waves: Often normal; can be increased by anxiety, caffeine, or medications like benzodiazepines.\n- “Regional dysrhythmias left temporal/frontotemporal” (maximum T3–F7, F3–Fp1): This means irregular activity focused on the left temporal and left frontal areas. Focal slowing/irregularity in one region suggests that part of the cortex is irritable or not functioning typically.\n- “Isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes”: Sharp waves are the EEG pattern most associated with an increased risk of seizures. Seeing them, especially when they localize to the temporal region, raises suspicion for a focal epileptic tendency. “Rudimentary” implies they’re small or not textbook-perfect, so the finding is suggestive rather than definitive.\n- Hyperventilation slightly increased these regional changes; photic stimulation did not: No signs of photosensitivity. Mild activation with hyperventilation is common in people with an epileptic focus but is still a supportive, not definitive, clue.\n\nHow this fits your symptoms\n- Temporal lobe seizures can present without convulsions. Common symptoms include brief episodes of disorientation, a hard‑to‑describe “weird” feeling, trouble thinking, anxiety or fear, deja vu, a rising stomach sensation, lip smacking or fiddling movements, and tiredness afterward. Trembling/shivering can occur.\n- However, similar symptoms can also come from migraines, panic/anxiety, sleep disorders, dysautonomia, medication effects, or nonepileptic spells. That’s why clinical correlation is critical.\n\nKey points about EEG and epilepsy\n- A single routine EEG is imperfect: many people with epilepsy have a normal first EEG, and a small percentage of people without epilepsy can show sharp transients.\n- Focal sharp waves in a consistent region (here, left temporal/frontotemporal) are more specific and are part of why your neurologist wants an epilepsy specialist’s opinion.\n\nWhat to expect next\n- The specialist may recommend:\n  - A brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol to look for a structural cause in the left temporal/frontal region.\n  - A longer or sleep‑deprived EEG, ambulatory EEG, or inpatient video‑EEG monitoring to capture your typical spells.\n  - Review of medications/substances that can lower seizure threshold (for example, bupropion, tramadol, some stimulants) and sleep/alcohol habits.\n\nSafety until you’re evaluated\n- Follow local driving rules after a possible first seizure or concerning EEG; ask your doctor about driving restrictions where you live.\n- Avoid swimming alone, working at heights, locking bathroom doors, and bathing in tubs; prefer showers.\n- Prioritize sleep, avoid binge drinking, and keep well hydrated and nourished.\n- Do not stop any prescribed medication abruptly without medical advice.\n\nHow to prepare for the visit\n- Keep a symptom diary: time, duration, what you feel first, whether awareness is impaired, any triggers, and how you feel afterward.\n- Ask someone who has seen an episode to come or write a description; a phone video can be very helpful.\n- Bring a list of medications and supplements.\n- Questions you might ask:\n  - Do these EEG findings count as epileptiform discharges?\n  - Do my episodes sound like focal aware or focal impaired awareness seizures?\n  - Should I have an MRI (epilepsy protocol)?\n  - Do I need prolonged or sleep‑deprived EEG?\n  - Do I need to start anti‑seizure medication now, or wait for more data?\n  - What are the driving and safety recommendations for me?\n\nBottom line\n- Your EEG shows left temporal/frontotemporal sharp waves and focal irregularity, which increases the likelihood of focal epilepsy but doesn’t prove it. Given your symptoms, it’s reasonable and timely to see an epilepsy specialist to confirm the diagnosis and discuss next steps. If you notice any new or more severe episodes (loss of consciousness, injury, prolonged confusion), seek medical care promptly.",

    "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I’m (23F) 5’4, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I’m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I’m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I’ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she’s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I’ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she’s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I’ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I’ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn’t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won’t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I’m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can’t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
    "answer": "Thanks for the detailed context. I’ll keep this practical and focused on risk, why the interaction checkers flag your combo, and what you can do with your prescriber to keep things safe.\n\nKey interactions and what they mean\n- Bupropion (Wellbutrin) and seizure risk:\n  - Bupropion is dose‑dependent for seizures and is the main “lowered seizure threshold” driver in your regimen.\n  - Typical seizure incidence: ~0.1% at 300 mg/day SR/XL; ~0.4% at 450 mg/day. At 150 mg/day XL, risk is very low but not zero.\n  - Risk climbs with sleep deprivation, stimulants, electrolyte abnormalities/dehydration, heavy alcohol use or withdrawal, abrupt benzo withdrawal, eating disorders, head injury, and use of other threshold‑lowering meds (e.g., tramadol, antipsychotics).\n\n- Bupropion + Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts):\n  - Pharmacokinetic: Bupropion is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; amphetamines are partly metabolized by CYP2D6. This can increase Adderall exposure and side effects (tachycardia, anxiety, insomnia), which you’re noticing.\n  - Pharmacodynamic: both are stimulating; in combination with sleep deprivation, they can further lower seizure threshold. Therapeutic‑dose amphetamine rarely causes seizures in otherwise low‑risk people, but the combo plus poor sleep and dehydration nudges risk up.\n\n- Trazodone:\n  - Generally low seizure risk at insomnia doses (e.g., 50–150 mg), but it can contribute slightly to threshold lowering.\n  - Common cause of orthostatic hypotension via alpha‑1 blockade. Your “graying out” when standing, especially with relative dehydration and appetite suppression from stimulants, fits this.\n  - Mild QT prolongation risk (usually clinically insignificant in healthy young people, but ECG is reasonable if you’re symptomatic).\n\n- Trazodone + Adderall:\n  - Rare but possible serotonergic toxicity has been reported with stimulants plus serotonergic meds; trazodone’s serotonergic effect at sleep doses is modest. Risk is low, but be aware of signs (see below).\n\n- Clonazepam:\n  - Raises the seizure threshold while onboard, but tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal (even short‑term if used frequently) can lower the threshold.\n  - Additive sedation with trazodone. Using it mainly as a sleep “hammer” can lead to rebound insomnia and tolerance.\n\nHow your personal risk stacks up\n- Protective: young, no personal/family seizure history, bupropion at 150 mg/day.\n- Increases risk: chronic sleep deprivation/insomnia, stimulant (and possibly higher exposure due to CYP2D6 inhibition), occasional dehydration and appetite suppression, high daytime HR, caffeine, and intermittent benzo use (if frequency creeps up or doses change abruptly). Psychedelics/cannabis add variability; psilocybin is serotonergic and best avoided with sleep deprivation or on stimulant days.\n\nPractical risk‑reduction steps to discuss with your psychiatrist\n- Dosing strategy\n  - Do not “double” bupropion. That is the one you really shouldn’t up‑titrate on your own because seizure risk rises with dose.\n  - Adderall: the bupropion interaction may effectively make your dose “feel” higher. Consider a lower afternoon dose, earlier last dose, or switching to a long‑acting formulation with a careful titration while monitoring HR/BP and sleep.\n  - Trazodone: if you need more than 100 mg often, discuss whether that’s the right agent. Higher doses can worsen orthostasis and next‑day grogginess.\n  - Clonazepam: try to keep PRN use infrequent and avoid abrupt changes in frequency or dose. Using it nightly for sleep tends to build tolerance.\n\n- Consider optimizing insomnia treatment\n  - CBT‑I is first‑line for chronic primary insomnia and has the best long‑term outcomes; it also lowers seizure risk by improving sleep continuity.\n  - If medication is still needed, non‑benzo options with minimal seizure impact include dual orexin receptor antagonists (daridorexant or lemborexant) or low‑dose doxepin (3–6 mg). Ramelteon is another low‑risk option. These can sometimes replace trazodone or reduce your need for clonazepam.\n  - Keep stimulant timing early and caffeine modest; consistent sleep/wake schedule.\n\n- Hydration and orthostasis\n  - Aim for steady fluids and electrolytes, especially on high‑activity or low‑appetite days.\n  - Rise slowly from bed; consider a short isometric “pump” (ankle/leg squeezes) before standing.\n  - If orthostasis persists or worsens, review trazodone dose, stimulant dose, and overall volume status with your clinician.\n\n- Monitoring\n  - Home BP/HR log for 1–2 weeks, including orthostatic vitals if you can.\n  - Baseline labs (BMP for electrolytes, CBC, TSH) and an ECG are reasonable given tachycardia, orthostasis, trazodone, and stimulants.\n  - Reassess caffeine, alcohol, cannabis, and psychedelic timing (avoid on stimulant days, and avoid when sleep‑deprived).\n\nAbout “it’s safe to double any of these if needed”\n- Bupropion: do not double. That recommendation is not aligned with labeling due to seizure risk.\n- Adderall: do not exceed prescribed daily max; with 2D6 inhibition, your effective exposure may already be higher.\n- Trazodone: doubling increases hypotension/sedation/QT risk; discuss any dose changes first.\n- Clonazepam: doubling increases sedation, psychomotor impairment, and dependence risk; avoid alcohol with it.\n\nWhen to seek care urgently\n- Possible serotonin toxicity: agitation, tremor, clonus/hyperreflexia, sweating, fever, diarrhea, confusion.\n- Syncope, chest pain, or sustained resting HR >130 bpm.\n- New neurologic symptoms: focal deficits, severe confusion, or any seizure-like activity.\n- Worsening orthostasis leading to falls.\n\nBottom line\n- Your current combo can be used together with careful monitoring, but the bupropion + stimulant + chronic sleep deprivation is the core seizure‑risk equation. At 150 mg bupropion the absolute risk is still low, but modifiable factors (sleep, hydration, stimulant/caffeine timing) matter.\n- The biggest safety gains likely come from: CBT‑I and/or switching the sleep med to a non‑benzo, reconsidering stimulant dosing/formulation given CYP2D6 inhibition, and avoiding self‑directed dose increases—especially with bupropion.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a concise plan to bring to your psychiatrist, or help you find a CBT‑I program (in‑person or digital) that fits your schedule.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with Ped Mal seizures since I was young. It has been triggered at times due to various reasons however those reasons have never been gaming. I ran into a game that gave a warning for Photosensitive epilepsy for its intense flashing however I play many games that have intense flashing but haven't had a episode. I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
    "answer": "Short answer: probably, but do it cautiously and with safeguards, and check in with your neurologist if you’re unsure.\n\nContext:\n- Only a small percentage (about 2–5%) of people with epilepsy are photosensitive. It’s more common in teens and tends to decrease with age. Absence (petit mal) epilepsy can be photosensitive, but it’s less common.\n- Game warnings are broad; many people with epilepsy can play without issues, especially if they’re well-controlled on medication like lamotrigine.\n- That said, flashing lights, high-contrast patterns, saturated reds, and specific flicker rates can still trigger seizures in susceptible people.\n\nPractical steps to reduce risk if you choose to try:\n- Before playing\n  - Be well-rested, hydrated, and take meds on time. Avoid alcohol or playing when sleep-deprived or ill.\n  - If available, turn on the game’s “reduce flashing,” “photosensitivity,” or “seizure-safe” accessibility options. Consoles sometimes have global “reduce flashing” settings—enable them.\n- Display and environment\n  - Play in a well-lit room (don’t play in the dark).\n  - Lower screen brightness and contrast; use warmer color settings if possible.\n  - Increase distance from the screen; use a smaller screen or windowed mode at first.\n  - Disable strobe/backlight scanning/black frame insertion, dynamic contrast, and any “motion blur” or “screen shake” options.\n  - Avoid VR or 3D modes for now.\n- How to test\n  - Preview gameplay footage on a phone or small window to see if it feels comfortable.\n  - Start with short sessions (5–10 minutes), with someone nearby the first time if possible. Take regular breaks.\n  - Stop immediately if you notice eye discomfort, eyelid fluttering, facial twitching, nausea, dizziness, sudden confusion, or brief staring spells.\n- If anything feels off or you’ve ever had light-triggered symptoms, ask your neurologist about a photic stimulation EEG to check for photosensitivity. That gives the most tailored answer.\n\nBottom line:\n- Since you’ve had no episodes since starting lamotrigine and you already tolerate similar games, it’s reasonable to try this game with the precautions above. No one can guarantee zero risk, but these steps significantly lower it.\n- If you do experience any symptoms, stop and contact your neurologist. Seek emergency help if a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, you have repeated seizures without recovery, or you’re injured.",

    "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",
    "answer": "Short answer: you’re not overthinking. What you describe could be seizures, and it’s worth getting evaluated.\n\nWhy this sounds concerning for epilepsy:\n- Brief “blanking out” with inability to respond, sometimes with brief arm/neck jerks, is consistent with seizure types such as absence, focal impaired-awareness seizures, or myoclonic seizures (often part of generalized epilepsy like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).\n- Triggers you noted—sleep deprivation and alcohol—commonly lower seizure threshold. Cannabis and some other drugs can as well.\n- Family history of generalized seizures with alcohol is relevant.\n- ASD is associated with a higher rate of co‑occurring epilepsy.\n- Tics typically don’t cause a period of unresponsiveness and are often preceded by an urge and are partly suppressible; that makes tics less likely to explain these particular spells.\n\nOther possibilities (less likely based on what you wrote): psychogenic nonepileptic events, severe inattention/dissociation, or tic/stereotypy overlap. But given your triggers and description, epilepsy needs to be ruled out first.\n\nWhat to do next:\n1) Arrange medical evaluation soon:\n- See your primary care clinician and ask for a neurology referral.\n- Tests commonly ordered: EEG (ideally with sleep deprivation or prolonged/video EEG) and a brain MRI. Basic labs (glucose, electrolytes) may also be checked.\n\n2) Safety until you’re evaluated:\n- Avoid alcohol completely for now, and prioritize consistent sleep.\n- Avoid recreational drugs; high-THC cannabis and any stimulants can lower seizure threshold.\n- Don’t drive, swim alone, climb heights, or operate dangerous machinery until cleared.\n- If you take or are offered medicines that can lower seizure threshold (for example bupropion, tramadol, high-dose antihistamines like diphenhydramine, some antidepressants/antipsychotics), discuss risks with your clinician first.\n- If you use benzodiazepines, don’t stop them abruptly—withdrawal can provoke seizures.\n\n3) Track episodes:\n- Keep a diary: date/time, what you were doing, sleep/alcohol/drug intake, duration, any warning (aura), confusion afterward, tongue biting, injuries.\n- Ask a trusted person to video an event if it’s safe—this helps neurologists a lot.\n\nGo to urgent care/ED if:\n- Any event lasts 5 minutes or more, or you have repeated events without full recovery between them.\n- You have a full-body convulsion, serious injury, trouble breathing, or a new severe headache, fever, or weakness/numbness afterward.\n\nA few questions that help narrow things down:\n- Do these events happen more in the morning or shortly after waking? Any dropping objects from sudden arm jerks?\n- Do lights or screens trigger them?\n- Is there confusion or fatigue after an episode?\n- Any tongue biting (especially on the sides) or incontinence?\n- Have you had any recent head injuries or new medications?\n\nIf you’d like, share those details and I can help you prepare for your appointment.",

    "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn’t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I’m having seizures based on what she’s seen and observed and what I’ve told her, but I’m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel “weird”. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I’m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it’s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I’m making this up for attention, that it’s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that’s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don’t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I’ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—please see a doctor soon. What you describe sounds very consistent with focal (temporal lobe) seizures, and your current medication and cannabis use can lower the seizure threshold. Migraine aura and sleep paralysis can explain some pieces, but they don’t fit as well with the repeated daytime spells with sudden emotion changes, slowed speech, staring, nausea, memory “replays,” and post‑episode fatigue.\n\nWhy seizures are plausible\n- Typical features you report: sudden rising/nausea feeling, abrupt intense emotion (anger/anxiety), brief staring with slowed/limited speech, odd/autobiographical memories “replaying,” disorganized thoughts, and short post‑episode confusion/tiredness. These are classic focal aware or focal impaired‑awareness (temporal lobe) seizures.\n- Triggers you’ve noticed (sleep deprivation, stress, possibly after meals) commonly lower seizure threshold.\n- Bupropion at 200 mg twice daily (400 mg/day) increases seizure risk; risk rises further with low body weight/weight loss, dehydration/electrolyte issues, and other substances. High‑THC cannabis can also lower seizure threshold.\n\nWhat else it could be (less likely from your description)\n- Migraine aura: usually a gradual spread over 5–60 minutes (often visual), often followed by a headache; doesn’t typically cause abrupt speech arrest/staring or vivid memory replay.\n- Sleep paralysis: fits your first in‑bed episode (brief, electric/buzzing, can’t move at sleep onset), but doesn’t explain the daytime restaurant/parking‑lot events.\n- PNES (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures): possible in anyone with anxiety; diagnosis requires video‑EEG. Importantly, PNES is not faking—it’s involuntary. Your descriptions still sound more like temporal lobe seizures.\n\nWhat to do now\n1) Contact your prescriber today about bupropion.\n- At 400 mg/day, bupropion has a known dose‑related seizure risk. Given your new spells and recent weight loss, ask about reducing the dose or switching to a different antidepressant. Don’t change it on your own—do it with your prescriber’s plan.\n2) Hold cannabis for now.\n- High‑THC products can lower seizure threshold and confound the workup. If you continue, avoid high‑THC strains; CBD-dominant products are less pro‑convulsant, but best is to pause until evaluated.\n3) Urgent neurology/primary care evaluation (ideally within 1–2 weeks).\n- Tests to request:\n  - EEG (soon after an event is best). If routine EEG is normal and spells continue, ask about ambulatory or video‑EEG monitoring.\n  - Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol.\n  - Labs: CMP (electrolytes, glucose, kidney/liver), magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, TSH, B12, folate, HbA1c/fasting glucose, iron studies, and recheck vitamin D. Pregnancy test if applicable.\n4) Safety until you’re cleared:\n- No driving, swimming alone, bathing in tubs, heights, or operating dangerous machinery.\n- Use showers instead of baths; avoid locking bathroom doors; tell close contacts what to do if you have an episode.\n- Seek emergency care if an event lasts >5 minutes, events cluster back‑to‑back, you’re injured, or you have a new severe headache, fever, head trauma, or persistent focal weakness.\n5) Reduce other seizure‑threshold–lowering risks:\n- Sleep 7–9 hours nightly; keep a regular schedule.\n- Hydrate well, especially with hyperhidrosis; avoid overheating.\n- Regular meals/snacks; consider smaller, balanced meals to avoid big sugar swings.\n- Avoid or be cautious with alcohol and OTC meds that can lower seizure threshold (e.g., diphenhydramine, decongestants, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine).\n6) Keep a spell log (and capture video if possible):\n- Date/time, what you were doing, triggers (sleep loss, stress, meals), exact symptoms, duration, awareness/speech, movements/automatisms, eye deviation, confusion after, injuries, and how long recovery took. Ask your girlfriend to video an event if safe.\n\nAbout your other symptoms\n- Frequent headaches/migraines: can coexist with epilepsy. Neurology can address both.\n- Dizziness and reduced exercise tolerance + 20 lb weight loss: ask to check orthostatic vitals and labs noted above to look for dehydration/electrolyte issues, thyroid problems, anemia, or glucose abnormalities. These can worsen both migraines and seizure risk.\n- Vitamin D: consider supplementation per your clinician (commonly 1000–2000 IU/day unless otherwise directed).\n\nA few clarifying questions to bring to your visit\n- Exact bupropion formulation (SR vs XL) and any recent dose changes? Any missed doses then “make-ups”?\n- Alcohol or other substances/OTC meds/supplements?\n- Family history of seizures or migraine? Any prior head injury or CNS infection?\n- Relation of episodes to your menstrual cycle?\n- Any new medications or illnesses around when this started?\n\nBottom line: Your symptoms and risk factors make focal seizures a real possibility and warrant prompt evaluation. You’re not “making this up.” Even if spells were PNES, that is not intentional and still needs care. Please loop in your prescriber about bupropion now, pause cannabis, follow the safety steps above, and arrange an urgent neurology workup with EEG and MRI. If another significant event occurs or anything lasts longer than 5 minutes, go to the emergency department.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with EA2 after an unexpected hospital stay. Of course I have been researching the condition, and came across 4-AP. I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won’t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn’t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, and I’m glad you asked. What you’re proposing—trying 4‑aminopyridine (4‑AP) so you can taper off prednisone—is reasonable for many people with EA2, and there is published evidence to support it. A few key points you can use to guide next steps:\n\nWhat 4‑AP/dalfampridine can do in EA2\n- Evidence: Small randomized, double‑blind crossover trials and series have shown that low‑dose 4‑AP reduces attack frequency and improves gait/quality of life in EA2 and related CACNA1A disorders. It’s commonly used when acetazolamide (Diamox) is inadequate or poorly tolerated.\n- Forms and dosing used in practice:\n  - Dalfampridine extended‑release (ER) 10 mg every 12 hours. FDA‑approved for MS walking, but often used off‑label for EA2 because of steadier levels and safer seizure profile.\n  - Immediate‑release compounded 4‑AP, often 5 mg three times daily (sometimes titrated to 5–10 mg TID) in experienced hands. This can work well but requires a reliable compounding pharmacy and careful monitoring.\n- Can be combined with acetazolamide. Many patients stay on acetazolamide and add 4‑AP; some can lower the acetazolamide dose after stabilization.\n\nSafety essentials (your clinician will screen for these)\n- Do not use if you have a history of seizures, or if kidney function is reduced (creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min). 4‑AP is renally cleared; higher levels increase seizure risk.\n- Check baseline kidney function and review meds that lower seizure threshold (for example bupropion, tramadol, some antidepressants/antipsychotics).\n- Stick to recommended doses (with ER dalfampridine, do not exceed 10 mg every 12 hours and do not crush/chew tablets).\n\nAbout prednisone\n- Chronic prednisone isn’t a standard maintenance therapy for genetically confirmed EA2. Some people feel better acutely, but long‑term risks (weight gain, bone loss, glucose and blood pressure issues, cataracts, infection risk, adrenal suppression) are real.\n- Many neurologists aim to replace steroids with better‑tolerated options (acetazolamide, 4‑AP) and then taper steroids slowly to avoid withdrawal or symptom rebound.\n\nPractical ways to move this forward fast\n1) Talk with your current neurologist using concrete asks\n- “I have EA2 and still have breakthrough episodes despite acetazolamide 500 mg BID. Could we try dalfampridine ER 10 mg twice daily off‑label? My goal is to reduce attacks and taper prednisone.”\n- Offer to start with a 4–8 week monitored trial, tracking attack frequency, duration, and side effects.\n- Ask them to order baseline creatinine/eGFR and review seizure risk and other meds.\n\n2) Insurance and access tips\n- Generic dalfampridine ER is widely available. Insurers sometimes require prior authorization for off‑label use—documentation of EA2 diagnosis and inadequate control on acetazolamide usually helps.\n- If coverage is denied or delayed, a reputable compounding pharmacy can provide 4‑AP immediate‑release (e.g., 5 mg capsules). Your clinician must specify a reliable pharmacy; quality matters.\n\n3) If your neurologist won’t prescribe it\n- Consider a second opinion with an ataxia/CACNA1A‑savvy neurologist. If the local movement clinic is out‑of‑network, look for:\n  - Academic neurology or neurogenetics clinics with an ataxia program (many do telehealth for follow‑ups).\n  - The CACNA1A Foundation and the National Ataxia Foundation provider directories.\n- I can help you find options if you share your state/region.\n\nOther points to consider with your clinician\n- Confirm the diagnosis if not already genetically established (CACNA1A testing), because it strengthens the case for 4‑AP and helps long‑term planning.\n- Monitor acetazolamide safety: electrolytes (bicarbonate, potassium), kidney stones risk, paresthesias/fatigue.\n- Rescue strategies for attacks: some clinicians use an extra acetazolamide dose, a short‑acting benzodiazepine, rest/cooling, and trigger avoidance (heat, exertion, stress, sleep loss, alcohol, caffeine, illness).\n- If you’ve been on daily prednisone for a while, taper slowly once 4‑AP/acetazolamide control improves—never stop suddenly. Your doctor may check morning cortisol if suppression is likely.\n\nA short “letter of medical necessity” your doctor can adapt\n- Diagnosis: Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), probable/confirmed CACNA1A.\n- Current therapy: Acetazolamide 500 mg BID; persistent breakthrough attacks; chronic prednisone 5 mg for symptom control with desire to taper due to long‑term risk.\n- Request: Trial of dalfampridine ER 10 mg twice daily (off‑label) for EA2. Rationale: Published randomized and observational data demonstrate reduced attack frequency and improved gait; patient has inadequate control on first‑line therapy. Plan: Baseline creatinine/eGFR; avoid if CrCl ≤50 mL/min or seizure history; monitor efficacy and tolerability over 8 weeks; aim to taper prednisone if improved.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Any history of seizures or kidney issues\n- Your other meds/supplements\n- How often and how long your attacks are, and main triggers\n- Your state/region\nI can tailor a safer plan to discuss with your doctor and help you locate a prescriber familiar with 4‑AP for EA2.",

    "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ? I feel flooded by these emotions, I cry.Then it took like 15 minutes to come back to normal, I am in a very confused state and go back to sleep.Any idea what was that ?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry that happened — it sounds very unsettling. A few things can cause a brief episode on awakening where thinking feels slow, fragmented, or “not yours,” sometimes with fear and derealization. Based on what you described and the time course (gradual return to normal over ~15 minutes), here are the main possibilities:\n\nMost likely\n- Confusional arousal (“sleep drunkenness”) or pronounced sleep inertia: Waking abruptly out of deep sleep can leave you in a half‑awake state with impaired, slippery thinking, minimal inner speech, disorientation, and a sense of “not me.” It can feel scary and can trigger panic. It’s more likely if you’re sleep‑deprived, have an irregular sleep schedule, use alcohol/sedatives, or have untreated sleep apnea. Episodes often last minutes and resolve fully.\n- Nocturnal panic/dissociation: Panic can start out of sleep, with a surge of fear, derealization/depersonalization, and difficulty organizing thoughts. Physical signs (racing heart, rapid breathing, sweating) may be subtle or go unnoticed when you’re focused on your mind.\n\nNeeds ruling out\n- Focal (temporal lobe) seizure: Can cause sudden fear, déjà vu/jamais vu, thought blocking, loss of inner speech, feelings that thoughts aren’t yours, and brief confusion with recovery over minutes. These can happen out of sleep and without shaking. If this is on the table, you’d need a medical evaluation (EEG, possibly MRI).\n- Migraine aura without headache: Auras can be purely cognitive (word‑finding problems, “glitchy” thinking) and last 5–60 minutes. Not everyone gets a headache after.\n- Metabolic issues (e.g., low blood sugar), medication/substance effects (alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, sleep meds), or carbon monoxide exposure can also cause odd awakenings and confusion.\n\nRed flags — seek urgent care now or call emergency services if any occur\n- New weakness or numbness on one side, slurred speech, trouble speaking or understanding, facial droop, severe sudden headache, double vision, trouble walking, chest pain, or persistent confusion.\n- Prolonged episodes (>1 hour), loss of consciousness, injuries, or repeated episodes in a short time.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Make an appointment with your primary care clinician. Describe the episode in detail and ask about:\n  - Basic labs: glucose, electrolytes, thyroid, B12.\n  - Sleep evaluation if you snore, gasp, or feel unrefreshed (sleep apnea can trigger confusional arousals).\n  - Neurology referral if episodes recur: EEG (ideally with sleep deprivation or ambulatory) and possibly brain MRI to look for focal seizures; migraine assessment if you have a history of migraine or auras.\n- Keep a brief log: time to bed/wake, caffeine/alcohol/cannabis/meds, stress levels, and details of any repeat episodes (duration, symptoms, whether you could speak, any movements, heart rate).\n- Safety: Install/check carbon monoxide detectors; avoid alcohol or sedatives near bedtime; keep a regular sleep schedule; manage stress before bed.\n\nIf it happens again\n- Turn on lights, sit up, orient yourself (state your name, date, where you are), take slow breaths (4–6 per minute), and do a simple grounding routine (look around and name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, etc.).\n- Note whether you can speak normally, smile evenly, lift both arms, and whether you have one‑sided numbness or vision changes.\n- If you have a home glucometer and a history of blood sugar issues, check it.\n- If safe, ask your partner to observe or record a short video; this can be very helpful for doctors.\n- Don’t drive or operate machinery until you feel fully normal.\n\nA few quick questions that would help narrow this down:\n- Your age and medical history (migraine, seizures, diabetes, sleep apnea, anxiety)?\n- Any snoring, witnessed apneas, or unrefreshing sleep?\n- Medications or substances (including alcohol, cannabis, sleep aids, stimulants) used that evening?\n- Did you have racing heart, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, unusual smells/tastes, déjà vu, or repetitive movements?\n- Could you speak normally during the episode, or were words hard to find?\n\nMany people have a one‑off confusional arousal, especially with poor sleep, and never experience it again. Still, because your experience involved cognition in a striking way, it’s reasonable to get checked to rule out seizures or other medical causes.",

    "question": "(20F) 5’3” 134lbs Drink/Smoke occasionally, every other day Zyrtec, south asianThis has been a daily issue for ~ a decade. I sleep and wake up about the same times. I pee 2-4 times in the night even if I don’t drink after 9:30pm.Sometimes I can feel myself “shutting down”, or falling asleep and my body starting to paralyze. I hear crazy noises (exploding head syndrome). Mostly 1-3 times i am in a dream and cannot move my body at all. Feels like a magnet is preventing me from moving my head left to right. I’m crying and screaming to lift a finger.It is so exhausting. I wake up fatigued and usually anxious. My brain fools me into thinking I’m free the first time, but then I’m paralyzed again. This is normal dreams + nightmares.I have major depression and anxiety. I heard that epilepsy can make you feel paralyzed in your sleep, and have trouble with memory. I have short-term memory loss past few years. I never have bruises or anything though. Please help!",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. What you describe sounds most consistent with recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (often with hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including “exploding head syndrome”), plus significant sleep fragmentation and nocturia. These are exhausting but usually not dangerous. The pattern you describe is not typical for epilepsy.\n\nKey points\n- Sleep paralysis: Brief episodes as you’re falling asleep or waking where you’re aware but cannot move or speak, often with intense fear, pressure on the chest, or loud noises. Commonly triggered by sleep deprivation, irregular sleep, stress/anxiety, alcohol/nicotine, and other sleep disorders. Not a seizure.\n- Exploding head syndrome: Benign sensory event during transitions to/from sleep. Startling but harmless.\n- Nocturia (2–4 times/night for years): Can be driven by fragmented sleep, evening alcohol/caffeine/nicotine, high salt intake, overactive bladder, urinary issues, and especially obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA can occur even at normal BMI and is more common in South Asians due to airway anatomy. OSA can cause frequent night urination, awakenings, morning fatigue/anxiety, and memory problems.\n- Narcolepsy is also on the table given frequent paralysis and vivid dreams. Look for: irresistible daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotion (cataplexy), sleep attacks, very quick dreaming when dozing off. A sleep study can sort this out.\n- Memory issues are often from poor/fragmented sleep, anxiety/depression, and cannabis/alcohol; less commonly from medical issues (thyroid/B12/iron, diabetes).\n\nWhat would help now\n1) See your primary care clinician and ask for:\n   - Labs: CBC, ferritin/iron, TSH, B12, CMP (kidney/electrolytes), A1c or fasting glucose, urinalysis/urine culture. Pregnancy test if relevant.\n   - Review of substances/meds (including any sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine; cetirizine is usually fine but can still make some people groggy).\n   - Referral to a sleep specialist for an overnight sleep study (polysomnogram). If excessive daytime sleepiness is present, follow with a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) to check for narcolepsy. Treating an underlying sleep disorder (like OSA) often reduces nocturia and paralysis.\n\n2) Keep two short diaries for 1–2 weeks:\n   - Sleep diary: bed/wake times, awakenings, paralysis episodes, alcohol/nicotine/caffeine timing, naps.\n   - Bladder diary: time/amount of all fluids, times/volumes of urination day and night, urgency, any leakage. This helps distinguish overactive bladder vs nocturnal polyuria vs sleep-fragmentation urination.\n\n3) Sleep and lifestyle steps that often reduce paralysis and nocturia:\n   - Fixed sleep/wake schedule (including weekends). Aim 7.5–9 hours in bed.\n   - Avoid alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, and caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime (earlier is better). These fragment sleep and increase night urination.\n   - Limit fluids 3 hours before bed; avoid salty/spicy foods at dinner. Double-void before bed.\n   - If you get ankle swelling, elevate legs for 1–2 hours before bed and do a brief walk; this reduces nighttime fluid shift to urine.\n   - Side-sleeping and treating nasal congestion can reduce snoring/OSA risk. Consider nasal saline/rinses for allergies; discuss other allergy options with your clinician if needed.\n   - For anxiety at bedtime: 10–15 minutes of wind-down (dim lights, screens off, breathing exercises). CBT-I or CBT for anxiety/depression can help both sleep and memory.\n   - If an episode occurs: remind yourself it’s temporary and harmless; focus on slow breathing and try moving just one small muscle (toe/finger), or controlling eye movements, which can break the paralysis.\n\nWhen to seek care urgently\n- New seizures, waking with tongue biting (especially on the side), unexplained injuries, or incontinence; repeated episodes of loss of consciousness; falling asleep while driving; severe daytime sleepiness; signs of diabetes (excess thirst/urination with weight loss); burning/pain with urination or fever; suicidal thoughts.\n\nA few questions that would help me tailor advice:\n- Do you snore, gasp, or wake with a dry mouth or morning headaches? Any witnessed pauses in breathing?\n- How sleepy are you in the daytime (do you doze off unintentionally)? Epworth Sleepiness Scale >10 suggests excessive sleepiness.\n- Any episodes of sudden muscle weakness triggered by laughter/emotion (cataplexy)?\n- Typical daily caffeine/alcohol/nicotine/cannabis use and timing?\n- Any urinary urgency, burning, leakage, or pelvic pain?\n- Do you take any other meds or supplements (including sleep aids or antihistamines like Benadryl)?\n\nYou’re not alone in this, and with a proper evaluation (especially a sleep study) and some targeted changes, these symptoms are very often treatable.",

    "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
    "answer": "Short answer: expect them to keep checking your liver for a while and add kidney-focused labs. Then, if everything stabilizes, the labs usually become less frequent.\n\nWhat’s typically monitored on Keppra (levetiracetam) + Topamax (topiramate):\n- Kidney function and electrolytes (a “renal panel”): creatinine/eGFR, BUN, sodium, potassium, chloride\n- Serum bicarbonate (very important with Topamax due to risk of metabolic acidosis)\n- Liver tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin): not strictly required for these drugs, but reasonable to continue until your prior elevations normalize, then periodically\n- CBC: not routinely required with Keppra/Topamax, but a baseline and symptom‑driven follow‑up is common\n\nTherapeutic drug levels:\n- Keppra and Topamax don’t usually need routine level checks. Levels can be helpful if seizures persist despite reported adherence, if side effects appear, during pregnancy, with significant kidney disease, suspected interactions, or if there’s concern about absorption/adherence.\n\nHow this often plays out after a switch from Tegretol:\n- Early phase (after the change): CMP or BMP plus bicarbonate at baseline and after dose titration (e.g., 2–4 weeks), then around 2–3 months to confirm stability. LFTs are commonly included during this period to document normalization after Tegretol.\n- Maintenance phase (once stable): kidney function and bicarbonate every 6–12 months, sooner with dose changes, illness, dehydration, or new symptoms. LFTs annually or if there’s any clinical concern. CBC if symptoms (easy bruising, infections, unusual fatigue).\n- Drug levels only if clinically indicated (as above).\n\nSymptoms to report promptly:\n- For Topamax: rapid breathing, unusual fatigue, confusion (possible acidosis), kidney stone symptoms (flank pain, blood in urine), heat intolerance/decreased sweating\n- For Keppra: new or worsening mood/behavior changes, irritability, depression\n- For either: worsening seizures, severe drowsiness, signs of infection or bleeding\n\nPractical ask at your next visit:\n- “Can we do a CMP that includes electrolytes, creatinine/eGFR, and bicarbonate, and include LFTs for now given my prior elevations? How often do you want these while I’m stabilizing, and then long‑term if stable?”\n- “Do you foresee any need for Keppra/Topamax levels in my case?”\n\nIf you share your current doses, timing of the switch, most recent LFT values, and any kidney history, I can suggest a more tailored monitoring schedule.",

Should I see my neurologist or GP about this It’s been happening for about 2 months now, I think I have Blepharospasm in my left eye, could this be related to my epilepsy?",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—book an appointment with your neurologist soon (and loop in your GP/psychiatrist). What you describe could be non‑epileptic (more likely) but it’s worth ruling out a seizure type and checking for medication side effects.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- Temporal lobe seizures rarely present as an isolated, sustained eyelid closure. Eyelid “myoclonia” in epilepsy is usually very rapid fluttering of both eyelids for 1–3 seconds, often triggered by light or closing the eyes, and may include brief unresponsiveness.\n- What you describe—one eyelid forcibly “sticking closed” for ~10 seconds—fits better with:\n  - Blepharospasm (a focal eyelid dystonia; often bilateral but can start on one side),\n  - Hemifacial spasm (involuntary contractions around one eye/one side of the face),\n  - Medication‑induced dystonia/tardive blepharospasm (risk is higher with antipsychotics).\n- You’re on high dopamine‑blocking load (aripiprazole + risperidone). Dystonia and tardive syndromes can present exactly like this. If “2 x 30 mg aripiprazole” means 60 mg/day, that’s above usual max dosing and increases risk of movement disorders.\n\nWhat to do next:\n- See your neurologist: ask whether this could be dystonia vs hemifacial spasm vs seizure. They may suggest an exam during an event, EEG (possibly with photic stimulation), and coordination with psychiatry.\n- Contact your psychiatrist/prescriber soon to review antipsychotic dosing. Do not stop medications abruptly, but dosage adjustments or switching agents may be considered if this is a tardive/dystonic effect.\n- Consider an eye exam to rule out ocular surface irritation (dry eye/blepharitis) that can trigger reflex eyelid spasm.\n- Try to capture a clear video of an episode (face in frame, describe awareness, triggers, and duration). Keep a brief diary: time, trigger (light, stress, screen use), whether awareness changes, any facial pulling or mouth twitching, and if it happens during sleep.\n\nSeek urgent care now if:\n- You develop eye pain/redness or vision changes, symptoms spread to the whole face/limb, there’s new weakness/numbness, or episodes start including impaired awareness, falls, or clustering.\n\nDriving/safety:\n- Until clarified, treat these as potentially neurologic episodes: avoid driving, swimming alone, heights, or operating dangerous machinery.\n\nBottom line: This could be blepharospasm or medication‑related dystonia and is less likely to be a new seizure type, but given your epilepsy and meds, it’s appropriate to see your neurologist and prescriber soon to sort it out.",

    "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
    "answer": "Short answer: No—23andMe will not meaningfully screen for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nDetails:\n- TSC is caused by pathogenic variants in TSC1 or TSC2. Clinical diagnosis often relies on imaging/clinical features plus clinical‑grade genetic testing.\n- 23andMe does not include TSC1/TSC2 in its Health Predisposition or Carrier Status reports. Their genotyping chip doesn’t reliably detect the wide variety of TSC1/TSC2 variants (including many private variants, deletions/duplications, and mosaicism). A “negative” 23andMe result would not rule out TSC.\n- If TSC is a concern, ask your child’s neurologist or a medical geneticist for clinical testing: sequencing plus deletion/duplication analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 (often part of an epilepsy or TSC panel). This is the appropriate test, and some labs offer relatively fast turnaround and financial assistance.\n\nGiven your situation (suspected infantile spasms):\n- Infantile spasms are a neurologic emergency—diagnosis and treatment should ideally occur within days, not weeks. If you see more clusters, return to the ER and use the words “infantile spasms,” show videos, and ask for urgent pediatric neurology and EEG. Many centers will admit for expedited video EEG.\n- Brain MRI (not head ultrasound) is the preferred imaging to look for features of TSC (cortical tubers, subependymal nodules). Additional evaluations for TSC can include a Wood’s lamp skin exam, echocardiogram for cardiac rhabdomyomas, and renal imaging.\n- First‑line treatments for infantile spasms are typically ACTH or high‑dose prednisolone; if TSC is suspected/confirmed, vigabatrin is usually first‑line. Discuss urgently with a pediatric neurologist—treatment often shouldn’t wait for every test result once the diagnosis is confirmed on EEG.\n\nIf you’re considering going to the US, presenting to a children’s hospital ER with good videos of the events can often get you same‑day neurology evaluation and EEG. In parallel, you can request your local team to expedite a “STAT” EEG and pediatric neurology review.\n\nResources you may find helpful:\n- TSC Alliance (information on diagnosis/testing and care pathways)\n- Child Neurology Foundation (infantile spasms resources)\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your region and I can suggest nearby tertiary pediatric centers or labs that offer clinical TSC testing.",

    "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. The pattern you describe—recurrent episodes clustered around the start of your period, altered awareness with amnesia, groaning/mumbling reported by others, feeling like you stop breathing, then confusion afterward, plus rapid relief with lorazepam—does raise concern for a seizure-like disorder that could be catamenial (menstruation‑related). However, there are other conditions that can look very similar, especially when severe menstrual pain/vomiting are involved.\n\nPossibilities to consider (more than one could be present):\n- Catamenial epilepsy: seizures that occur or worsen around menses due to hormonal shifts (progesterone drop). Some people have seizures only during this window. Benzodiazepines can stop these.\n- Catamenial cyclic vomiting syndrome or severe menstrual migraine/brainstem migraine: can cause waves in the head, nausea/vomiting, tingling, confusion, and respond to benzodiazepines/antiemetics.\n- Severe dysmenorrhea/endometriosis with autonomic instability or vasovagal syncope: can cause fainting, groaning, amnesia, and “weird heart” sensations.\n- Panic/hyperventilation triggered by hormonal changes: can cause tingling, feeling you can’t breathe, and relief with lorazepam—but true loss of consciousness and post‑event confusion are less typical.\n- Dysautonomia/POTS, cardiac arrhythmia, metabolic issues (electrolytes, low iron) can contribute to tingling, palpitations, and near‑syncope.\n\nRed flags that warrant urgent care (ER now or call emergency services):\n- Vomiting blood again, black stools, severe chest pain, persistent trouble breathing, severe or “worst headache,” new weakness/vision/speech problems, a convulsive episode lasting >5 minutes, repeated episodes without full recovery, or prolonged confusion.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) Neurology evaluation (priority)\n- Ask for an EEG, ideally ambulatory/video EEG timed to the days symptoms usually occur (around day −2 to +3 of your period). A routine EEG between episodes can be normal even if this is epilepsy.\n- Brain MRI to rule out structural causes.\n- Discuss a rescue plan (e.g., intranasal midazolam or diazepam) and whether short courses of medication around menses (e.g., lorazepam or clobazam for a few days) are appropriate.\n- Until evaluated, use seizure precautions: avoid driving, swimming alone/bathing in a tub, heights, operating dangerous machinery; shower with door unlocked; have someone check on you during high‑risk days.\n\n2) Gynecology\n- Because episodes are cycle‑linked, ask about menstrual suppression options (continuous combined oral contraceptives, progestin‑only methods like DMPA, or progesterone supplementation) which can help catamenial epilepsy and catamenial vomiting/migraine.\n- Assess for severe dysmenorrhea or endometriosis.\n\n3) Primary care/cardiology and GI as needed\n- Cardiac rhythm monitoring (Holter/event monitor) to exclude arrhythmia given “weird heart” and near‑syncope.\n- Orthostatic vitals for POTS/dysautonomia.\n- Labs: CBC, ferritin (iron deficiency can worsen RLS‑like symptoms), CMP with magnesium and calcium, TSH, glucose, pregnancy test if applicable, B12.\n- Given the prior esophageal tear (likely Mallory–Weiss), discuss a GI follow‑up and a clear antiemetic plan to prevent severe retching.\n\n4) Symptom tracking\n- Keep a daily log for 2–3 cycles: period start/stop, symptoms (timing, duration, loss of awareness, confusion length, tongue biting/incontinence, triggers), meds taken, and witnesses’ observations. Bring this to your appointments.\n\n5) What may help in the meantime (discuss with your clinician)\n- NSAIDs: Start ibuprofen or naproxen 24–48 hours before your expected period and take on schedule the first 2–3 days (with food and within safe dosing limits). This can blunt prostaglandin‑driven pain/vomiting, which may reduce downstream events.\n- Antiemetics at first hint of nausea (e.g., ondansetron as prescribed).\n- Hydration and electrolytes; regular meals if you can keep food down.\n- Prioritize sleep; avoid alcohol, stimulants, and cannabis (can worsen vomiting or lower seizure threshold in some).\n- If anxiety/hyperventilation sensations start, slow paced breathing (e.g., 4‑second inhale, 6‑ to 8‑second exhale) may reduce tingling—but this is not a substitute for medical evaluation.\n\nAnswers to your main question\n- Could this be catamenial epilepsy? Yes, it’s possible based on timing, altered awareness/amnesia, post‑event confusion, witnessed vocalizations, and response to lorazepam. It is not the only explanation, and proper diagnosis requires neurologic evaluation with EEG (ideally captured during the high‑risk menstrual window) and brain imaging.\n- No family history doesn’t rule it out. Many people with epilepsy have no family history.\n\nA few clarifying questions that will help your doctors:\n- Has anyone witnessed full‑body stiffening/jerking, head/eye deviation, bluish lips, tongue‑biting (especially on the side), or incontinence?\n- About how long do episodes last, and how long are you confused afterward?\n- Do you ever wake with a bitten tongue, sore muscles, or unexplained injuries?\n- Do you have heavy periods, severe cramping, or pelvic pain between periods?\n- Any current medications or substances that could lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, tramadol), or cannabis use?\n- Do you have iron deficiency, RLS, or migraine history?\n\nGiven the severity (including a prior GI bleed), please arrange follow‑up promptly with neurology and gynecology, and use emergency services if any red flags occur again.",

    "question": "F25, 5’6” 108 lbs.conditions: epilepsy, migraines, endometriosismeds: junel fe 1/20 birth control, pristiq, aptiom (started two weeks ago), and aimovig injection monthly.Yesterday I started feeling pain in my neck and base of the skull on the right side. I could feel a very tender lump right where the occipital lymph node is (thanks google!) I did palpate it a lot, and it is extremely painful today. I was also up all night with an awful migraine (first one in months since I started Aimovig) and it spread to my entire head and it was 8/10 pain. I do not have a fever. My headache is better when upright and has gotten a bit better throughout the day but the very painful bulge is still there. It also hurts at rest in that area. I felt lethargic and drained this morning.Took a covid test. Negative. Worried I have an infection or something but no fever? I have a big, painful and possible infected spit of cystic acne on my right cheek. Not sure if related.I’ve also been having bad muscular pain on the right side of my shoulder after packing and lifting boxes, it kept me up thursday night. But it got better-ish. Not sure if it’s related. Kinda feels worse today.Should I be concerned? It hurts to turn my head/move my head at alland I know that if I lie down my headache would return. If i even brush the lymph node it hurts so much. Was hard to brush my hair.Any insight appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: swollen potential lymph node in the occipital area at the base of skull. very painful. have a headache. concerned about infection but no fever.",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—this deserves an in‑person exam soon (same day or within 24 hours). A very tender new lump at the base of the skull with neck pain and a severe headache needs a clinician to look at your scalp/ear/neck and check your neuro exam and vitals.\n\nWhat this could be\n- Most likely: a reactive occipital lymph node from a local scalp issue (pimple/folliculitis, bug bite, scratch, dandruff infection) or an inflamed scalp cyst/boil. These can be very tender and make brushing hair painful. Repeated palpation can worsen the soreness.\n- Muscular strain or occipital neuralgia from recent lifting/packing can cause severe back‑of‑head pain and neck movement pain, and sometimes a tender spot at the occipital nerve exit—this can be mistaken for a “lump.”\n- Less common but important to rule out: mastoid/ear infection, meningitis (usually with fever and marked neck stiffness), or arterial dissection (unilateral neck pain/headache often after neck strain—look for neurologic symptoms). Your lack of fever is reassuring, but not definitive.\n\nWhy I suggest being seen\n- The lump is extremely tender and interfering with head/neck movement and hair brushing.\n- Your headache was severe and is worse when lying down.\n- You recently started eslicarbazepine (Aptiom). Early on, it can rarely cause drug reactions with lymph node swelling, and it can cause low sodium (hyponatremia), which can present with headache and fatigue. A quick exam and possibly a sodium check would be reasonable.\n\nWhat to check at home right now\n- Look (or have someone look) at the right posterior scalp and behind the ear: any red, hot, swollen bump, crusting, ingrown hair, insect bite, or drainage?\n- Any ear pain, sore throat, dental pain, or tender areas along the jaw/behind the ear?\n- Is the lump red/warm or rapidly enlarging?\n\nGo to urgent care/ER now if any of the following appear\n- “Thunderclap” worst‑ever headache, new neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, double vision, severe dizziness/imbalance), confusion, stiff neck with fever or rash.\n- Rapidly spreading redness, swelling, or severe ear/mastoid pain.\n- Vision changes, repeated vomiting, or the headache is steadily worsening.\n\nIf none of the above, and you can be seen within 24 hours\n- Avoid poking the lump.\n- Warm compress to the tender area 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily.\n- Pain relief: ibuprofen 400 mg every 6–8 hours with food (max 1200 mg/day OTC) or naproxen 220 mg every 12 hours; or acetaminophen 650–1000 mg every 6–8 hours (max 3000 mg/day). Avoid NSAIDs if you have a history of ulcers/kidney issues.\n- Gentle neck range‑of‑motion, avoid heavy lifting for a few days, and sleep with your head slightly elevated (since lying flat worsens the headache).\n- Hydrate well.\n\nMedication notes to discuss with your clinician\n- Eslicarbazepine (Aptiom) can lower blood sodium and can rarely cause drug reactions with fever, rash, and lymph nodes. If you develop rash, fever, swelling of face, dark urine, or worsening fatigue/confusion—seek care urgently.\n- Eslicarbazepine can reduce the effectiveness of combined birth control pills like Junel Fe 1/20. Use backup contraception and ask your prescriber about alternatives.\n\nHelpful details to bring to the visit\n- Exact location/size of the lump and whether it’s red or warm.\n- Any scalp lesions/bites you’ve noticed.\n- Whether you have ear, dental, or throat symptoms.\n- Any new neurologic symptoms, vision changes, or worsening pattern.\n- When Aptiom was started and your current dose.\n\nIf you answer with: 1) whether there’s a visible sore/bug bite/cyst on the right posterior scalp or behind the ear, 2) whether the lump is red/hot, and 3) any ear/dental symptoms or new neurologic signs, I can help refine next steps.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
    "answer": "I’m sorry your family is going through this—what you describe is very frightening. The good news is that she’s already in the hospital, which is exactly where she needs to be. Based on your description, here are the most likely possibilities doctors will be considering. Only her clinicians can diagnose this, but this may help you understand what they’re looking for.\n\nWhat could be happening\n- Postictal confusion or postictal psychosis: After seizures—especially clusters—people can be confused, disinhibited, speak oddly (including in the third person or with a different voice/accent), write nonsense, giggle, or behave childlike. Postictal psychosis can include agitation, paranoid or self-deprecating comments, and usually resolves over 24–72 hours with supportive care and sometimes short-term meds.\n- Ongoing seizures in the brain without obvious convulsions (nonconvulsive status epilepticus, NCSE): Persistent confusion, odd speech/writing, and fluctuating behavior between convulsions can be due to continuing electrical seizure activity. This needs urgent EEG (ideally continuous EEG) and treatment.\n- Focal (often temporal lobe) seizures: These can cause speech automatisms, changes in voice/accent, laughing, hugging objects, writing random words, and then another convulsion.\n- Metabolic triggers from the eating disorder or medications: Purging/restriction can cause low sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or low blood sugar—any of which can trigger seizures and prolonged confusion. Certain antidepressants (notably bupropion, TCAs) lower seizure threshold; sleep medications, missed doses, or withdrawal from benzodiazepines/Z-drugs can also precipitate seizures.\n- Infection/inflammation of the brain: Encephalitis (including autoimmune, like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis) can present with new seizures plus rapidly changing behavior and speech. This is less common, but important to consider if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic events can coexist with true epilepsy, but they don’t explain abnormal EEG/labs if those are found.\n\nKey tests and actions to ask about (the team likely is already doing many of these)\n- Urgent EEG (preferably continuous EEG) to rule out NCSE.\n- Labs: glucose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, kidney/liver function, complete blood count; consider tox screen; antiepileptic drug levels if applicable.\n- Brain imaging: CT is a start; MRI with epilepsy protocol is often needed.\n- If fever, neck stiffness, severe headache, or continued deterioration: evaluation for encephalitis (including lumbar puncture) may be considered.\n- Thorough med review: exact names, doses, and timing of her antidepressant, sleep aid, and seizure medicine; any recent changes; any missed doses; over-the-counter or herbal products.\n\nInformation the family can provide to help the team\n- Complete medication list with doses and when she last took each.\n- Details of the eating disorder behaviors (purging, restricting, laxatives, fluid intake), which are critical for electrolyte assessment.\n- A timeline of the seizures and behaviors last night (approximate times, how long each episode lasted, how she was in between).\n- Any recent illness, fever, head injury, alcohol or substance exposure, or sleep deprivation.\n\nReassurance and safety\n- The third-person speech, odd accent/voice, giggling, hugging a pillow, and writing random words can all occur during or after seizures—especially temporal-lobe seizures—or as part of a postictal state. It’s terrifying to witness, but it can be a known neurologic phenomenon rather than intentional behavior.\n- If she’s having frequent or prolonged events, that’s treated as a neurologic emergency (status epilepticus). Hospital protocols involve benzodiazepines and antiseizure medications.\n- After discharge, she should not drive, swim alone, bathe unattended, climb heights, or operate heavy machinery until cleared by her neurologist.\n\nGoing forward\n- Coordination between neurology and psychiatry is important to choose mood/sleep medications that are safer in epilepsy and to address the eating disorder, which can be a major seizure trigger via electrolyte disturbances.\n- Ensure reliable sleep, medication adherence, and follow-up with an epilepsy specialist. An MRI and outpatient EEG (if not already done) are standard in new-onset epilepsy.\n\nYou’re doing the right thing by getting her urgent care. If her confusion or behavioral changes persist or worsen, or if seizures continue, emphasize to the team your concern for nonconvulsive status epilepticus and electrolyte disturbances from the eating disorder, as those are treatable causes that can be addressed promptly.",

    "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can’t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can’t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it’s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can’t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn’t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn’t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven’t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",
    "answer": "I’m very concerned. New, relentless headache with severe photophobia, nausea/vomiting, confusion, inability to stand or walk because symptoms worsen upright, plus episodes of anisocoria are red flags. Please take him to the emergency department today. Do not wait for outpatient labs.\n\nWhy this is urgent\n- Anisocoria with severe headache can signal a neurologic emergency (aneurysm/3rd-nerve palsy, carotid/vertebral dissection, acute glaucoma, etc.).\n- A headache that is clearly worse when upright and better lying flat strongly suggests spontaneous intracranial hypotension from a spinal CSF leak. This is frequently missed, and a non-contrast brain MRI can be normal early on.\n- Other dangerous conditions to rule out now: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis/encephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and less likely but possible atypical migraine triggered/worsened by nitrates.\n\nWhat to ask for in the ER\n- Urgent neurology evaluation.\n- Careful eye exam for papilledema, 3rd-nerve palsy, or Horner syndrome; fundus exam.\n- MRI brain with gadolinium and MRV (venous study). If concern for aneurysm or dissection, CTA/MRA head and neck.\n- If MRI shows signs of intracranial hypotension (or if clinical suspicion remains high despite normal MRI), proceed to spine imaging for a CSF leak: MRI total spine with contrast and, if needed, dynamic CT myelography or digital subtraction myelography to localize a leak or CSF–venous fistula.\n- If a CSF leak is suspected, discuss an epidural blood patch. A non-targeted patch can be both diagnostic and therapeutic; targeted patches follow if needed.\n- Basic labs (CBC, CMP, electrolytes), orthostatic vitals. Lumbar puncture should be deferred unless imaging rules out low-pressure states and there’s a strong reason (e.g., to evaluate meningitis), because LP can worsen a CSF leak.\n- If anisocoria recurs or there’s oculomotor dysfunction, ensure prompt vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) to exclude aneurysm/dissection.\n- Outpatient tests like Wilson disease and porphyria panels are reasonable to complete later but should not delay emergency evaluation; they don’t typically cause a strictly positional, light-intolerant headache with anisocoria.\n\nAbout the nitroglycerin patch\n- Nitroglycerin commonly causes severe headaches and worsens orthostatic symptoms by lowering blood pressure. It can also trigger migraines.\n- Do not stop it on your own if he uses it for angina. Call the prescriber now or have the ER team review whether it can be held or adjusted while this is being evaluated.\n\nUntil you get to care\n- Keep him lying flat; avoid standing/sitting upright as much as possible.\n- Hydration; consider caffeine (e.g., coffee or 200 mg caffeine tablet up to 2–3 times/day if no contraindications) which can sometimes relieve low-pressure headaches.\n- Avoid straining (use a stool softener if needed), heavy lifting, coughing, or Valsalva.\n- Dark, quiet environment; sunglasses/eye mask. Avoid driving.\n\nIf you can, bring this summary to the ER:\n- 25-year-old male with 2+ weeks of severe continuous headache, marked photophobia, nausea/vomiting, confusion, imbalance, dramatically worse when upright and somewhat relieved lying down; two brief episodes of anisocoria. Brain MRI reportedly “normal” (unclear if with contrast). EEG normal. On nitroglycerin patch. Request MRI brain with gadolinium and MRV, consider CTA/MRA head/neck, and evaluation for spontaneous intracranial hypotension/CSF leak with spine imaging and possible epidural blood patch.\n\nIf you can share whether his prior MRI included contrast, any papilledema was seen, recent trauma/strain/coughing spells/epidural or lumbar puncture, connective tissue disorder features (e.g., hypermobility), changes in hearing (tinnitus/fullness), or orthostatic heart rate/blood pressure changes, that may refine the differential—but please don’t delay going to the ER.",

    "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her…",
    "answer": "I’m so sorry you and your fiancée are going through this. What you’re describing is every partner’s nightmare, and the uncertainty is agonizing. I’ll share the most useful things I can: what SRSE/NORSE is, what causes are most likely in someone like her, which treatments are commonly used (including less-standard options), what outcomes can look like, and concrete questions you can ask the team. Please use this to guide conversations with her neurologists/neurocritical care team.\n\nWhat this likely is\n- This sounds like new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), now super‑refractory (SRSE). In many young adults it is triggered by an autoimmune or post‑infectious encephalitis; sometimes no cause is found at first.\n- Her prodrome (fever, headache, myalgias, nausea/vomiting after a camping trip with insect bites) raises concern for:\n  - Viral/arboviral encephalitis (e.g., West Nile, Eastern equine, St. Louis, Powassan [ticks], Jamestown Canyon/California serogroup), HSV, VZV, enteroviruses, and Mycoplasma.\n  - Tick-borne illnesses (Lyme neuroborreliosis, ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis, RMSF).\n  - Autoimmune encephalitis (especially anti‑NMDA receptor in a young woman; also GABA-A/B, AMPA, LGI1/CASPR2, DPPX, GlyR). MRI can be normal early. CSF/serum antibody panels take time, and can be negative early.\n- Early LPs and PCRs can be falsely negative (e.g., HSV). It’s common to repeat testing after 48–72 hours while continuing empiric antivirals if suspicion remains.\n\nTreatments typically used in SRSE\nYour team has already used several standard approaches. There are additional options worth discussing:\n\n1) Anesthetic coma to EEG burst suppression\n- Pentobarbital coma is standard when midazolam/propofol/ketamine fail. Aim is EEG burst suppression for 24–48+ hours, then very slow wean while covered by multiple antiseizure meds.\n- Complications are real (hypotension, infections, ileus), but this can be lifesaving and is commonly used in SRSE.\n\n2) Antiseizure medication stacking\n- In addition to levetiracetam (Keppra), valproate (Depakote), and phenobarbital, consider:\n  - Lacosamide (IV)\n  - Fosphenytoin/phenytoin (if not contraindicated)\n  - Topiramate via feeding tube\n  - Clobazam via tube\n  - Perampanel via tube\n  - Brivaracetam (IV)\n- It’s normal to use several simultaneously during and after the coma to prevent rebound seizures.\n\n3) Immunotherapy (very important if autoimmune/NORSE is suspected)\n- High‑dose IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day x 3–5 days) – sounds like they’ve started.\n- IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days) and/or plasmapheresis (PLEX, 5–7 exchanges).\n- If refractory: rituximab or cyclophosphamide. In cryptogenic NORSE/FIRES, many centers escalate to IL‑1 blockade (anakinra) or IL‑6 blockade (tocilizumab) early; there are encouraging case series.\n- If anti‑NMDA encephalitis is suspected, urgent pelvic imaging to look for an ovarian teratoma is key; removal can be therapeutic. Consider whole‑body PET/CT if paraneoplastic encephalitis is a concern.\n\n4) Infectious coverage while tests are pending\n- Acyclovir should be continued until HSV is convincingly excluded (repeat CSF HSV PCR if early negative).\n- Based on geography/exposures, ask about adding/ensuring testing for West Nile (CSF/serum IgM), EEEV, St. Louis, Powassan, Lyme, ehrlichia/anaplasma, RMSF, and Mycoplasma. Some require serology rather than PCR.\n\n5) Ketogenic diet\n- Strongly consider an early ketogenic diet via feeding tube. It has evidence in SRSE/NORSE (especially FIRES) and can work even when multiple drugs fail. Many neuro‑ICUs can implement it.\n\n6) Other rescue/adjuncts used in specialized centers\n- Inhaled anesthetics (isoflurane) if IV anesthetics fail.\n- Hypothermia is occasionally tried; evidence is mixed.\n- Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has case reports of success in SRSE when all else fails.\n- Vagus nerve stimulation has been used acutely in refractory cases at some centers.\n- Trials/compassionate use neurosteroids: brexanolone (allopregnanolone) and ganaxolone have been used in SRSE under research or emergency pathways in select centers, though large trials have been mixed. If your center participates, ask about access.\n\n7) Don’t forget the rarer, treatable causes\n- Autoimmune thyroid disease (steroid‑responsive encephalopathy/Hashimoto’s) – check anti‑TPO/anti‑thyroglobulin; treatment is steroids.\n- Acute porphyria – check urine PBG/ALA if compatible symptoms; can treat with hemin.\n- Pyridoxine trial is low risk, though adult-onset deficiency is rare.\n\nPrognosis and hope\n- SRSE is dangerous, but recovery is possible, even after weeks of coma. Young people with autoimmune or post‑infectious causes often do much better than older adults if treated aggressively.\n- In anti‑NMDA encephalitis, the majority eventually achieve substantial recovery over months with immunotherapy and tumor treatment when applicable.\n- Cognitive and functional rehabilitation can be a long road, but many survivors regain independence. The duration of seizures alone does not determine outcome.\n\nConcrete questions to ask her team\n- Are we following a NORSE/SRSE protocol? Is a tertiary neuro‑ICU or NORSE-experienced center involved/consulted?\n- What infectious tests have been done/repeated (HSV/VZV PCR repeats; CSF/serum West Nile IgM; EEEV, St. Louis, Powassan; Lyme, ehrlichia/anaplasma, RMSF; Mycoplasma; enteroviruses)?\n- What autoimmune panels have been sent (CSF and serum anti‑NMDA, LGI1/CASPR2, GABA‑A/B, AMPA, DPPX, GlyR, Hu/Yo/Ri, and others)? When do we expect results?\n- Are we proceeding with full first‑line immunotherapy (steroids + IVIG and/or PLEX) and planning second‑line (rituximab/cyclophosphamide) if no response?\n- Have we screened for ovarian teratoma (pelvic ultrasound/CT/MRI)? Any plan for whole‑body PET/CT?\n- Will we implement a ketogenic diet now?\n- What is the EEG target during pentobarbital (e.g., burst suppression for 24–48+ hours), and how will the wean be staged to prevent rebound?\n- Which additional antiseizure meds will be added orally via tube (lacosamide, topiramate, clobazam, perampanel, brivaracetam)?\n- Could IL‑1 or IL‑6 blockade (anakinra/tocilizumab) be considered if this is cryptogenic NORSE/FIRES?\n- Is there access to investigational neurosteroids (brexanolone/ganaxolone) via trial or compassionate use?\n- Are we monitoring for propofol‑related infusion syndrome (CK, triglycerides, metabolic acidosis) and other sedation complications?\n- Can we get physical/occupational therapy positioning, DVT prophylaxis, and early prevention of ICU complications?\n\nAbout the earlier Babinski sign\n- A true bilateral Babinski months earlier would be unusual in a healthy young adult and usually prompts a neurologic workup. Occasionally it’s a false positive (ticklish/withdrawal). It’s hard to link directly, but it underscores the value of a thorough search for underlying causes now.\n\nSupport for you\n- Ask the team for regular family conferences with neurology, ICU, and case management. Keep a simple log of changes, questions, and answers.\n- Consider connecting with:\n  - NORSE Institute (norseinstitute.org) – information and family support.\n  - Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance (aealliance.org).\n  - The Encephalitis Society (encephalitis.info) – resources and helpline.\n- Take breaks, eat, sleep, and bring another trusted person to meetings to help take notes. You are an essential part of her care team.\n\nIf you share your region, I can help identify nearby centers with strong neuro‑ICU/NORSE experience. And if you want, I can help you draft a one‑page summary to hand the team with the key questions above. You’re doing the right things by advocating for her. Even in week 2 of SRSE, meaningful recovery is still possible.",

    "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing the details. Here’s a plain‑English unpacking of the terms in your report and how they fit with temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nBig picture\n- Your MRI and diagnosis are classic for right mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS): scarring and shrinkage of the right hippocampus, a structure deep in the temporal lobe that helps drive focal seizures and supports memory.\n- Because brain regions are connected, long‑standing damage in the hippocampus can lead to “downstream” changes in connected areas (like the thalamus) and to enlargement of nearby fluid spaces (ventricles) that simply fill in where tissue has been lost.\n\nWhat the specific terms mean\n- Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS): Loss of neurons and scarring (gliosis) in the hippocampus and nearby mesial temporal structures. It’s a common cause of focal impaired‑awareness seizures. On MRI, the hippocampus looks smaller and “brighter” on certain sequences.\n- “Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus”: In this context, this typically means the hippocampus is smaller (atrophy), has higher signal on T2/FLAIR images (from gliosis/scar), and often shows loss of its normal internal structure. These changes are what we call MTS.\n- Associated regional atrophy: “Atrophy” means shrinkage from tissue loss. “Associated regional” means not only the hippocampus but also other connected areas show some shrinkage. In your case, that includes the right dorsal thalamus.\n- Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus: The thalamus is a relay hub connected to the hippocampus. When the hippocampus is injured long‑term, connected thalamic nuclei can also shrink (a “secondary degeneration” phenomenon). This is supportive of a long‑standing right‑sided process.\n- Periventricular white matter: This is simply the white matter next to the brain’s ventricles (fluid spaces). It’s a normal anatomic region. In your report, it’s the site where a signal change was seen, which makes it part of the abnormality in your case (not just a general brain part).\n- T‑weighted high‑signal gliosis: “Gliosis” is the brain’s scarring response after an injury (astrocytes proliferate). On MRI, gliosis is usually bright on T2/FLAIR sequences and darker on T1. Many reports shorten this to “T2/FLAIR high signal from gliosis.” If your report literally says “T‑weighted high signal,” it almost certainly means T2/FLAIR. The radiology images would clarify the exact sequence.\n- Ex‑vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone: The “trigone” (also called the atrium) is the part of the lateral ventricle where the temporal and occipital horns meet. “Ex‑vacuo” means the ventricle looks larger because nearby brain tissue has atrophied—so the CSF space expands to fill the void. This is not a blockage of fluid and does not cause pressure buildup (not hydrocephalus); it’s a consequence of tissue loss.\n- T‑weighted high signal within the periventricular white matter with ex‑vacuo dilatation: Together, this reads as scarring in the white matter near the right trigone, with the adjacent ventricle expanded because of tissue loss there. It fits with an old injury.\n\nPossible causes\n- The two common explanations you were given are both plausible:\n  - Seizure‑related brain injury over time (especially with early life prolonged febrile seizures or status epilepticus).\n  - A prior ischemic or inflammatory insult (for example, a prior small stroke, encephalitis, head trauma, or hypoxic event) that set the stage for MTS and the periventricular gliosis.\n- Often, the exact timing/cause can’t be pinned down from MRI alone.\n\nHow this relates to symptoms\n- Focal impaired‑awareness seizures (previously “complex partial”) from the right temporal lobe often cause staring, unresponsiveness, automatisms (lip smacking, hand movements), a rising déjà vu or epigastric sensation, confusion afterward, and sometimes a progression to a bilateral tonic‑clonic seizure.\n- Right hippocampal injury tends to affect visual/spatial and contextual memory more than verbal memory (left side is more verbal). People can notice trouble with navigation, remembering where things are, or complex scene memory.\n\nTreatment implications (brief)\n- When seizures are not well controlled, it’s important to know: if you’ve tried and failed two appropriate anti‑seizure medications, that meets the definition of drug‑resistant epilepsy. MTS is among the most surgically treatable epilepsies.\n- Options at a comprehensive epilepsy center can include: further presurgical evaluation (video‑EEG, high‑resolution MRI, neuropsych testing, possibly PET/SPECT or stereo‑EEG), and treatments such as anterior temporal lobectomy or laser ablation (LITT). Neuromodulation (RNS, DBS, or VNS) is considered when resection isn’t ideal. Many people with well‑localized MTS achieve substantial seizure reduction or freedom.\n- The ex‑vacuo ventricular enlargement itself usually needs no treatment.\n\nQuestions you could ask your neurologist\n- Can we review the MRI sequences together (confirm which sequences show high signal)?\n- Do my seizures meet criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy, and should I be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy center?\n- Would neuropsychological testing help map my memory strengths/weaknesses and lateralization?\n- Are there concerns about mood, sleep, or cognition we should address alongside seizure control?\n\nIf you share your age, seizure history (onset, meds tried/doses), and any early‑life events (febrile seizures, head injury, encephalitis), I can help put the radiology findings in even clearer context. This is general information and not a diagnosis—your treating neurologist’s guidance should take priority.",

    "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn’t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this—your symptoms are significant and deserve a thorough, urgent work‑up. The combination of new, fluctuating eye misalignment/ptosis, severe vertigo with nystagmus/oscillopsia, vomiting, tremor, seizures, and episodes of shallow breathing is not typical of a single benign condition.\n\nWhat needs urgent attention now\n- Go to the ER (preferably a hospital with neurology on site) if you have any of the following: worsening shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, choking on liquids, slurred speech, new limb weakness, double vision that is constant and new/worsening, continuous vomiting/dehydration, severe new headache, confusion, or new seizures.\n- Do not drive until this is clarified.\n\nMost important possibilities to consider (not a diagnosis)\n- Ocular or generalized myasthenia gravis (MG): Fluctuating double vision/eye deviation and eyelid droop that worsen with use, and episodes where “the muscles let go” of your eyelids are classic. Nighttime breathing weakness can occur. Antibodies can be negative in ocular MG; negative labs do not rule it out.\n- Central (brain/brainstem) causes: Demyelinating disease (e.g., MS), brainstem/cerebellar inflammation or ischemia, or the Miller Fisher/Bickerstaff spectrum (autoimmune; often causes ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, nystagmus; anti-GQ1b antibodies). These can present with oscillopsia and severe vomiting.\n- Medication or metabolic effects: Lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine can cause nystagmus, diplopia, vertigo, and tremor when levels are high. Oxcarbazepine commonly causes hyponatremia, which can provoke seizures and nausea. This must be checked even without dose changes.\n- Vestibular migraine can cause severe vertigo and nystagmus, but the eye muscle weakness/ptosis and breathing issues make me cautious about assuming this is “just migraine.”\n- Autoimmune encephalitis or Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (SREAT): Can cause seizures, tremor, vertigo, and other neurologic symptoms with often normal MRI early on.\n- Thyroid eye disease: Less likely given the acute fluctuating pattern, but worth screening given Hashimoto’s.\n\nTesting and consultations to ask for\n- Neuro-ophthalmology and neuromuscular neurology evaluations urgently.\n- MRI brain with and without contrast focused on brainstem/cerebellum (not just the inner ear), and consider MRA/MRV if indicated.\n- Myasthenia testing beyond basic antibodies:\n  - AChR binding, blocking, and modulating antibodies; MuSK and LRP4 antibodies.\n  - Single-fiber EMG (of orbicularis oculi or frontalis) — most sensitive for ocular MG.\n  - Repetitive nerve stimulation.\n  - Simple bedside tests (ice-pack test for ptosis) can support the diagnosis.\n- Pulmonary function testing if breathing feels shallow: forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF), especially during symptomatic periods.\n- Labs: comprehensive metabolic panel with sodium (check for hyponatremia), magnesium; lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine serum levels; TSH and free T4; thyroid antibodies (TPO, TSI/TRAb).\n- Autoimmune/inflammatory workup if central causes suspected:\n  - Anti-GQ1b and ganglioside antibody panel (Miller Fisher/Bickerstaff).\n  - Autoimmune encephalitis panel (serum ± CSF), including LGI1/CASPR2, NMDA, GAD65.\n  - Lumbar puncture if advised.\n  - EEG given recent seizures.\n- Vestibular testing (VNG with oculomotor testing) once safe enough not to trigger severe vomiting.\n\nMedication and safety notes\n- Triptans can be risky if your episodes include brainstem/“basilar”-type aura symptoms (vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria). Discuss before using again.\n- Ask your doctors about short-term antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) and vestibular suppressants for crisis days. Benzodiazepines can help vertigo and are seizure-rescue meds, but they sedate—use only under guidance.\n- Because anticonvulsants can cause nystagmus/vertigo at higher levels, check drug levels and sodium soon.\n- Hydrate, small frequent meals; avoid sudden head movements; rest in a dim room on bad days.\n- With the flushing/red palms and the gray-purple foot episode: document with photos and report—could reflect autonomic changes or vascular spasm.\n\nHow to prepare for your neuro-ophthalmology visit\n- Bring a written timeline of symptoms, meds, and the seizure events.\n- Take short videos during episodes: eyelid droop, eye deviation, nystagmus, and any gait instability.\n- Note patterns: time of day fatigue, what worsens/improves ptosis/diplopia, and any triggers.\n\nIf your current neurologist is not pursuing further evaluation, seek a second opinion—ideally from:\n- A neuromuscular specialist (for seronegative/ocular MG and neuromuscular junction disorders).\n- A neuro-otologist or neuro-ophthalmologist (for oscillopsia/nystagmus).\nYou can usually find these at academic medical centers.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a concise summary to take to the ER or your next specialist, and a checklist of tests to request based on your exact timeline.",

    "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- Yes, your theory is plausible. PNES and epilepsy can coexist, and antiseizure medication can suppress epileptic symptoms while PNES persists.\n- The return of hallucinations right after stopping Keppra raises concern that at least some of her symptoms were epileptic and controlled by Keppra, and have now resurfaced.\n\nWhy this can happen\n- PNES vs epilepsy: Your wife’s ambulatory video‑EEG captured multiple events without an epileptic EEG pattern, which strongly supports PNES for those specific spells. However, that does not rule out less frequent true epileptic seizures. Comorbidity is reported in roughly 10–30% of PNES patients.\n- EEG limitations: A 3‑day home EEG can miss some focal seizures, especially from deep/mesial temporal regions, and may not capture the full variety of a person’s events. Inpatient epilepsy monitoring (EMU) is more sensitive.\n- Hallucinations and seizures: Hallucinations can be ictal auras or part of post‑ictal states, particularly in temporal lobe epilepsy. If those hallucinations were seizure-related, Keppra could have suppressed them; stopping it could allow them to recur.\n- Medication effects: Keppra itself is not an antipsychotic, and it can sometimes worsen mood/behavior in some people. So the more likely explanation for the improvement you saw while on Keppra is seizure control rather than a direct antipsychotic effect. That said, personal responses vary.\n- Important nuance: The spells you describe as “absent seizures” with long post‑event confusion, headaches, and transient aphasia are not typical of classic absence seizures (which are seconds-long with no post‑ictal phase). They could be focal seizures or PNES; both can present with amnesia and headaches. The fact that some typical spells were recorded without EEG correlate supports PNES for those, but doesn’t exclude a second, epileptic spell type.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Contact her neurologist promptly to report the return of hallucinations after Keppra discontinuation. Ask if they want her to:\n  - Restart Keppra (or another antiseizure medicine) while awaiting further evaluation, and\n  - Expedite admission to an inpatient Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) to capture both her “spell” type and the hallucination episodes with high-quality video‑EEG.\n- Coordinate with her psychiatrist the same day, especially given her history of suicidality and self‑harm. If hallucinations are commanding, frightening, or she has any suicidal thoughts, seek urgent care or go to the ER.\n- Safety:\n  - Do not drive until cleared by her treating team.\n  - Avoid sleep deprivation, alcohol, and missed medications—these can trigger both epileptic seizures and PNES.\n  - Create or update a safety plan for any return of self‑harm urges.\n- Documentation:\n  - Keep a detailed diary of events (date/time, description, duration, triggers, recovery) and, if safe, brief smartphone videos. Note whether hallucinations are brief and stereotyped vs prolonged and variable.\n- Ask about:\n  - Inpatient EMU monitoring with provocation protocols to sort out PNES vs epilepsy and to try to capture the hallucination episodes specifically.\n  - An MRI with an epilepsy protocol if not already done.\n  - Whether any current psych meds might lower seizure threshold (for example, high-dose venlafaxine) and how to balance that risk.\n  - Evidence-based PNES treatment (CBT-based therapy, trauma-focused therapy if applicable) once epilepsy is adequately ruled in/out or treated.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or worsening suicidal thoughts, agitation, or command hallucinations.\n- Prolonged seizures, clusters, or injuries with events.\n- New neurological red flags (fever, severe headache, stiff neck, new weakness, confusion that doesn’t resolve) or abrupt marked behavioral change.\n\nBottom line\n- Your reasoning makes sense and is clinically plausible: she may have both PNES and epilepsy. The timing of the hallucinations’ return after stopping Keppra warrants prompt re‑evaluation and likely a period of renewed antiseizure coverage while a definitive inpatient video‑EEG workup is arranged. In parallel, continue building a PNES‑focused treatment plan with her mental health team.",

    "question": " Hi, I bit of back story here I've been diagnostic with NF1 when I was 5 ever since I had to do 2 MRI every year. every time they put a needle in my arm I would faint.So today I just got my blood draw for a schedule MRI in 3 weeks. And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
    "answer": "What you describe sounds most consistent with vasovagal syncope (also called reflex or neurocardiogenic syncope) triggered by needles/blood draws. When blood pressure and heart rate drop suddenly, the brief lack of blood flow to the brain can cause fainting. It’s also common to have brief, involuntary jerking or stiffening of the arms and legs during the faint—this is called convulsive syncope or myoclonic jerks. It can look like a seizure, but it’s caused by fainting and typically lasts only a few seconds with a quick recovery and little confusion afterward.\n\nWhen to seek care urgently\n- If you faint without a clear trigger, during exercise, or with chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or a new severe headache.\n- If the movements last >1–2 minutes, you’re confused for >10–15 minutes afterward, you bite the side of your tongue, or you injure yourself.\n- If there’s a family history of sudden cardiac death or you have known heart disease.\nOtherwise, let your primary doctor know about the jerking so they can document it and decide if any testing (like an ECG, rarely an EEG) is needed.\n\nPractical steps to prevent it at future blood draws/MRIs\n- Go in well hydrated; consider a salty snack and fluids beforehand (unless you’ve been told to fast).\n- Tell the staff you faint with needles and want to be lying flat with legs slightly elevated before, during, and for a few minutes after.\n- Use “applied tension” counter-pressure maneuvers: repeatedly tense your thighs, buttocks, and core hard for ~10–15 seconds, then relax for 20–30 seconds; start before the needle and repeat if you feel woozy.\n- Don’t watch the needle; use distraction and slow, steady breathing.\n- Ask about topical numbing (EMLA cream 60 minutes before, or cold spray just before the stick) and using a small butterfly needle.\n- Keep the room cool; ask for a fan or cool cloth if you tend to get clammy.\n- If anxiety is a big trigger, discuss options with your doctor (behavioral techniques, or a one-time anxiolytic if appropriate).\n\nA few questions to help clarify:\n- Did you have warning symptoms (nausea, warmth, tunnel vision, sweating) before you passed out?\n- About how long were you out, and how long did the movements last?\n- How quickly did you feel normal again?\n- Have you ever fainted outside of shots/blood draws? Any chest pain or palpitations with these episodes?\n- Any head injury from this episode?\n\nIf everything fits the classic pattern—brief faint with a needle, short jerks, quick recovery—it’s very likely vasovagal/convulsive syncope. Mention it to your doctor before your MRI so the team can plan to do the IV while you’re lying down and use the steps above.",

    "question": "49YO female with IBS like symptoms due to adhesions choking intestines, non-epileptic seizures due to migraines, deaf, in TCHP chemo for breast cancer, BMX August 1, 2018, no node involvement. 5'6, 220lbs. Effexor for seizure prevention. Bupropion for situational depression related to health challenges. I lost my hair to chemo, so for the first time I noticed I have ridges in my scalp. Googling that, only one thing comes up: Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG). My ridges, however, are very mild compared to most images. I can see them in the mirror, but can't find a way to accurately photograph them. They are very much like this in location and \"layout\", but not quite as deep. This is listed as something different though, related to mental retardation (article's words) from birth. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00105-007-1302-4 I do have a couple of the secondary issues listed, namely non-epileptic seizures and deafness. The former is blamed on migraines that left lesions on the brain and the latter is blamed on the seizures. Should I see an endocrinologist, or is this something else?",
    "answer": "Short answer: start with dermatology (or your primary care doctor), not endocrinology. Endocrinology is only needed if there are signs of a hormonal cause.\n\nWhy\n- Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) is a description of scalp skin that forms grooves/folds. It comes in:\n  - Primary (essential): usually in men, no other problems.\n  - Primary (non‑essential): rare, begins early in life and is associated with neuro/ocular issues.\n  - Secondary: due to another condition (most often endocrine or inflammatory/dermatologic) and can appear in adulthood.\n- In women, new-onset scalp folds are more often secondary or simply normal skin contours that become visible when hair is lost.\n- After chemo-induced hair loss, natural scalp lines and mild laxity often become noticeable; when hair regrows they’re usually far less apparent.\n\nWhat to do now\n- See a dermatologist (or your PCP) first. They can tell if this is:\n  - Normal scalp contour or bony ridges (hard/fixed) versus true skin folds (soft/pliable).\n  - An inflammatory scalp condition (psoriasis, eczema, folliculitis) that can exaggerate folds.\n  - True CVG, and whether it’s mild and benign or needs workup.\n\nIf the exam suggests a secondary cause, your doctor may order:\n- Thyroid tests: TSH and free T4 (hypothyroidism can do this).\n- IGF‑1 (screen for acromegaly). Endocrinology referral if IGF‑1 is high or if you have suggestive features.\n- Less commonly, they may consider scalp ultrasound or biopsy if something focal is suspected.\n\nWhen to involve endocrinology sooner\n- If you also have any of the following:\n  - Acromegaly signs: enlarging hands/feet (rings/shoes feel tighter), jaw/forehead enlargement, spaced teeth, snoring, carpal tunnel, sweating, headaches/vision changes.\n  - Hypothyroidism signs: fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, weight gain, slow heart rate, hair loss beyond chemo pattern.\n  - Rapid progression of scalp thickening/folds.\n\nReassurance\n- Mild, symmetric ridges that you only notice after hair loss are commonly benign. Many people have subtle sagittal or occipital grooves that hair normally hides.\n- The “primary non‑essential CVG” you found online typically starts in childhood and is not the usual explanation for a new, mild finding in a woman.\n\nPractical tip to document it (optional)\n- Take photos in side lighting (lamp at a low angle), with the scalp slightly damp, and tilt your head down. An oblique light makes shallow folds visible.\n\nUnrelated but important\n- Since you mentioned non‑epileptic seizures: if your seizure pattern changes, let your prescriber know. Bupropion can lower the seizure threshold in some people; your team may already have weighed risks/benefits given your specific diagnosis.\n\nBottom line: Book a dermatology (or PCP) visit to confirm what you’re seeing and screen for common secondary causes. Endocrinology is the next step only if the exam or basic labs point that way.",

    "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn’t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I’m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I’m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen’s uniformed perspective it doesn’t make sense to up the dosage unless we don’t see improvement?",
    "answer": "It’s a very reasonable question. In pediatrics, levetiracetam (Keppra) is almost always dosed by weight, and doctors typically “start low and go slow,” then step up to a target mg/kg dose over 1–3 weeks if it’s tolerated. So the increase your neurologist suggested is likely not because the 2 mL “failed,” but because 2 mL was the test/starting dose and 3 mL brings him closer to the usual maintenance range for his weight.\n\nWhy raise the dose if he’s better?\n- Goal is zero seizures. Even brief “dizzy/need to sit” spells may be seizures and can affect safety and learning.\n- Early good days can be misleading; seizures often fluctuate with sleep, illness, stress, or growth. A weight‑based maintenance dose gives more durable protection.\n- Keppra has a wide therapeutic range. Many kids need more than the initial starting dose to keep seizure‑free over time.\n- He did have minor events the first week on 2 mL, suggesting 2 mL may be just at the threshold.\n\nHow Keppra is usually dosed in kids (general info):\n- Oral solution is often 100 mg/mL. “mL” only tells volume; dosing decisions are based on mg/kg.\n- Common starting dose: about 10 mg/kg twice daily (total 20 mg/kg/day).\n- Titration: increase every 1–2 weeks if tolerated.\n- Usual maintenance: 20–30 mg/kg/day (and sometimes up to 60 mg/kg/day if needed), split twice daily.\n\nExample (just to illustrate): If the solution is 100 mg/mL and a child weighs 20 kg:\n- 2 mL twice a day = 400 mg/day ≈ 20 mg/kg/day (a typical starting total).\n- 3 mL twice a day = 600 mg/day ≈ 30 mg/kg/day (a common maintenance total).\n\nGood questions to ask your neurologist\n- What is the concentration of his Keppra (mg per mL)?\n- What is his current dose in mg/kg/day, and what is the target mg/kg/day?\n- Are those brief “dizzy spells” considered seizures?\n- How long do you want him completely seizure‑free before considering any dose reductions in the future?\n- What side effects should we watch for, and what’s the plan if they occur?\n- Do we need a rescue medication for seizures lasting >3–5 minutes or clusters?\n- Should we try vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) if mood irritability occurs on Keppra?\n\nSide effects to watch for with Keppra\n- Most common: irritability, mood swings, aggression, sleepiness, dizziness, decreased appetite. These often improve after the first few weeks.\n- Less common: behavioral changes that significantly affect school or home. If problematic, doctors sometimes suggest pyridoxine (vitamin B6), but ask before starting.\n- Serious reactions are uncommon. Do not stop Keppra abruptly—always discuss changes with the neurologist.\n\nSafety tips\n- Keep a seizure diary (dates, duration, description, possible triggers).\n- Prioritize regular sleep; manage illness promptly; avoid missed doses.\n- Water safety: supervised swimming, showers instead of baths.\n- Use helmets for biking; be cautious with heights.\n- Ask for a written seizure action plan for school/caregivers.\n\nBottom line: The recommended increase is likely a step toward a standard, weight‑based maintenance dose to maximize long‑term seizure freedom, not a sign that the current dose “isn’t working.” It’s appropriate to ask your neurologist to show you the mg/kg math for your son’s weight and explain the target dose and timeline so you feel comfortable with the plan.\n\nIf you share his weight and the bottle’s concentration (mg/mL), I can help you understand what 2 mL and 3 mL translate to in mg/kg/day.",

    "question": "48F, 152cm, 70kgGraves' disease in and out of remission for 10 years (remission last 2 years)Stopped carbimazole two weeks agoVery mild temporal lobe epilepsy for 30 yearsLevetiracetam 500mg dailyTetanus vaccination for deep cat scratch five days agoJust finishing a 5-day course of amoxicillin w/ clavulanic acid for same scratchA few days ago, I noticed some swelling above my left clavicle, and I can feel a pea-to-marble sized lump. Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—this could very well be a reactive lymph node from your recent tetanus shot and/or the cat scratch on the same side.\n\nWhy this fits:\n- Vaccines (including tetanus boosters) can cause temporary enlargement of nearby lymph nodes on the same side as the injection. This often appears 3–14 days after the shot, may be tender and mobile, and typically settles over 2–6 weeks.\n- A skin injury (like a deep cat scratch) on the arm or hand can also trigger lymph nodes that drain that area to swell. While the axillary nodes are most typical, supraclavicular nodes can be involved as part of the same drainage pathway.\n- Cat-scratch disease classically causes node swelling 1–3 weeks after the scratch (often in the armpit), so timing-wise your node a few days later points more toward the vaccine, but either could contribute.\n\nWhat to do now:\n- Since you already have an appointment, mention it there. In the meantime:\n  - Monitor but try not to keep palpating it (that can keep it irritated).\n  - You can use a warm compress and simple pain relief if it’s sore.\n  - Note the size and whether it’s tender and mobile; check once a week rather than daily.\n\nWhen to seek earlier review:\n- It rapidly enlarges, becomes hard/fixed, or is >2 cm.\n- It persists beyond about 3–4 weeks without shrinking.\n- You develop fevers, drenching night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or multiple enlarged nodes.\n- Worsening redness, warmth, or pain in the arm suggesting an ongoing skin infection.\n\nAbout your labs/meds:\n- Mild chronic lymphopenia (0.9) can occur for many benign reasons and doesn’t by itself point to something serious.\n- Slightly elevated liver enzymes can be seen with medications (including carbimazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate) and often normalize.\n- Your normal neutrophils just before stopping carbimazole are reassuring regarding that medication’s main blood risk.\n\nBottom line: in the context of a left-arm tetanus shot and recent scratch, a small, mobile lump above the left clavicle a few days later is most likely a reactive lymph node and often resolves on its own. Keep your upcoming appointment, and seek earlier care if any of the red flags above appear.",

    "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I’m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I’m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
    "answer": "Short answer: a single dose taken 3 hours late is unlikely to trigger a breakthrough seizure for most people on your regimen.\n\nWhy:\n- Vimpat (lacosamide) has a half‑life around 13 hours. It isn’t “out” at 12 hours—about half is still there. At 15 hours you’d still have a meaningful amount on board.\n- Phenobarbital has a very long half‑life (2–5 days), so its levels are very steady and provide some “buffer” when timing isn’t perfect.\n\nWhat to do now\n- You did the right thing by taking the dose as soon as you remembered.\n- Do not double up doses.\n- You can go back to your usual schedule for the next dose (even if that makes the interval ~9 hours). If you’re sensitive to side effects when doses are closer together, you could push the next dose 1–2 hours later today and then return to your regular times tomorrow.\n\nRisk window\n- Any increased seizure risk is mostly during the time you were late and the 1–3 hours after you took the dose while it absorbs. After that, and certainly after your next scheduled dose, you’re essentially back to baseline.\n\nDriving and safety today\n- If you feel completely normal, most people would be fine to go about the day. If missed/late doses have triggered seizures for you in the past, or if you feel “off,” consider avoiding driving for the rest of today.\n- Prioritize good sleep, hydration, regular meals, and avoid alcohol or other triggers.\n- Keep your rescue med (if you have one) with you, and make sure people around you know what to do.\n\nWhen to seek help\n- New/worsening auras, seizure clusters, or a seizure lasting >5 minutes (or repeated seizures without full recovery) = emergency care.\n- If you accidentally take extra doses or feel significant dizziness, fainting, or palpitations, contact your clinician.\n\nPrevention tips\n- Use a pill organizer plus two alarms (sound and vibration) on different devices; consider a smart watch/medication reminder app.\n\nYou did the right thing calling your doctor—follow their advice once they call back since they know your history. But based on typical pharmacology, a single 3‑hour delay like this is usually low risk.",

    "question": "28F. 5'8, 250lbs. White. History of epilepsy, asthma and vitamin D & B12 deficiency. Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. An FSH of 122 mIU/mL with 6 months of missed periods is strongly suggestive of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Below are the key points, what it means, why it happens, and what to do next.\n\nWhat this result likely means\n- In POI, the ovaries are not making enough estrogen and inhibin, so the brain cranks up FSH very high to try to stimulate them. Your value is in the postmenopausal range.\n- Unlike natural menopause, POI can be intermittent. Ovarian function may flicker on and off.\n- Confirmation: typically requires 2 elevated FSH levels (often >25–40 mIU/mL) at least 4 weeks apart, with low estradiol, after pregnancy is excluded and off any hormones.\n\nWill your periods or fertility come back?\n- Some people with POI ovulate unpredictably. About 25–50% have occasional return of bleeding/ovulation; 5–10% may conceive spontaneously over time.\n- That said, an FSH as high as yours makes persistent ovarian failure more likely, but it does not make pregnancy impossible.\n- If you don’t want pregnancy, you still need contraception because ovulation can occur unexpectedly. If you do want pregnancy, early referral to a reproductive endocrinologist is helpful.\n\nPossible causes\n- Autoimmune: the immune system can attack the ovaries; often clusters with thyroid disease, Addison’s disease (adrenal), type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease.\n- Genetic: Turner syndrome mosaicism; FMR1 premutation (Fragile X carrier); other chromosomal variants. These are more often checked when POI occurs under 30.\n- Iatrogenic: past chemotherapy, pelvic radiation, or ovarian surgery.\n- Infections and toxins: less common (e.g., mumps oophoritis), smoking.\n- Idiopathic: in many cases, a specific cause isn’t found.\n- Your current meds and conditions: lamotrigine and vitamin deficiencies are not known to cause high-FSH amenorrhea. Obesity and PCOS typically do not cause very high FSH.\n\nThings to be concerned about\n- Bone health: low estrogen accelerates bone loss. You already have vitamin D deficiency; you’ll need optimization and likely a bone density scan (DEXA) at diagnosis and periodic follow-up.\n- Cardiovascular health: earlier estrogen loss increases long-term heart risk.\n- Urogenital symptoms: vaginal dryness, pain with sex, urinary symptoms; hot flashes, sleep/mood changes.\n- Autoimmune adrenal disease risk: watch for red flags like severe fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, salt craving, darkening of skin; these warrant urgent evaluation.\n\nRecommended next steps\n- Confirmatory testing in 4–6 weeks: repeat FSH and estradiol (and a pregnancy test). AMH and antral follicle count by pelvic ultrasound can give context but aren’t required to diagnose POI.\n- Broader evaluation:\n  - Thyroid: TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibodies.\n  - Prolactin (once) and basic metabolic labs.\n  - Autoimmunity: 21-hydroxylase adrenal antibodies; screen for celiac (tTG-IgA with total IgA).\n  - Genetics: karyotype and FMR1 premutation testing (especially at your age).\n- Imaging: pelvic ultrasound to assess ovaries/uterus.\n- Referrals: gynecology or reproductive endocrinology for diagnosis, fertility counseling, and treatment; genetics if tests are abnormal; endocrinology if autoimmune issues suspected.\n\nTreatment\n- Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended for most with POI until the average age of natural menopause (~50) unless contraindicated. It protects bones, heart, and urogenital health and improves symptoms.\n  - If you have a uterus, you need estrogen plus a progestogen to protect the uterine lining.\n  - Transdermal 17β-estradiol (patch/gel) with oral micronized progesterone is often preferred, especially with higher body weight, to lower clot risk.\n- Important with epilepsy/lamotrigine: estrogens can lower lamotrigine levels and potentially worsen seizure control. If you start HRT or a combined hormonal contraceptive, coordinate closely with your neurologist to monitor levels and adjust dosing. Transdermal estrogen may still affect levels.\n- Contraception if pregnancy is not desired: HRT is not birth control. Consider a copper or levonorgestrel IUD (the LNG-IUD can also provide endometrial protection alongside transdermal estrogen).\n- Bone health: ensure vitamin D level in target range, adequate calcium intake (diet plus supplements if needed), weight-bearing and resistance exercise, limit alcohol, don’t smoke.\n\nFertility\n- Spontaneous pregnancy can happen but is unpredictable. The most effective option for achieving pregnancy with POI is IVF using donor eggs. If there’s intermittent function, your specialist can discuss any role for timed intercourse or stimulation, but success rates are limited with very high FSH.\n\nA few questions that help tailor advice\n- Any family history of early menopause, Fragile X-related conditions, autoimmune disease, or infertility?\n- Any prior chemotherapy/radiation, major pelvic surgery, or mumps infection after puberty?\n- Are you having hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, or new urinary symptoms?\n- Do you smoke?\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you list the exact labs to request and how to coordinate HRT with your seizure medications.",

    "question": "A few years back while In the military I had a freak accident until it stopped being that and continued to occur day after day. After some months I was diagnosed with epilepsy.In the beginning I was having 1-3 seizures a day while 2-4 of those were grand mal seizures a month. Medications didn’t work and just seemed to make everything worse so my neurologist made the decision to not give me medications after having tried 5 of them.It’s been a few years now and nowadays I get anywhere from 2-5? Every 4months and about 2 or 3 of those are grand mal seizures. A significant decrease but still ongoing. We never found a cause for the seizures.Well I’m asking because a few months back I started noticing a few things that started worrying me. For example,    a few years back and at the beginning of this I used to be “smart” as in I could write any word no matter how big or small but in recent months I’ve noticed I have a really hard time writing, as in spelling out words. I used to full on turn on autocorrect on my phone but nowadays I find myself almost completely depending on my phones autocorrect and looking up word spellings when even my phone can’t tell what I’m trying to say.    with writing again, for some reason I find myself forgetting or I don’t know, not using simple words such as “the” “of” “to” “and” “from” etc. or sometimes mistaking one word for another when there’s no connection between the two    same thing as above but with speech. I never had any speed impediment or any speech disorder prior but now I find myself getting “stuck” while trying to say a word. It’s to the point where it’ll happen at least once with every full sentence I try to speak. It’s gotten to the point where I’ll see it happening and I’ll try to say the word again and I won’t be able to, I’ll need to dramatically slow down my speech and literally say it in segments    dramatic increase in repeatedly forgetting. I’ll forget my keys, go back and get them, get there and forget what I was going to get or sometimes I’ll forget I forgot. So I’ll go back, then head back out and be like “I went back for my keys and came back without my keys” Male 23 5’11 185lbs first diagnosed at 20. The last neurologist was in the military prior to he being discharged so around 20years of ageEdit: cluster seizures have been very common with me. There’s been about 5x since it started where I’ve stopped breathing, one time in particular it was a really long time.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. What you’re describing—trouble spelling and writing, leaving out small words, getting “stuck” on words when speaking, and a big increase in forgetfulness—sounds like language (aphasia) and memory problems involving the brain’s language/memory networks (often the dominant temporal and parietal lobes). In someone with ongoing epilepsy, this can be due to:\n\n- Ongoing focal seizures or frequent “spikes” on EEG (even without obvious convulsions) disrupting language/memory\n- Post‑ictal effects that never fully clear before the next event\n- Cumulative effects of repeated generalized seizures and episodes where breathing stopped (hypoxia)\n- An underlying structural, inflammatory/autoimmune, or metabolic cause that wasn’t previously detected\n\nThese symptoms are not “just normal after seizures” and deserve urgent re‑evaluation by an epilepsy specialist.\n\nWhat to do now\n- If you’re having a cluster of seizures, any seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, or any event where breathing stops or turns blue: call emergency services now.\n- Otherwise, arrange an urgent appointment (within 1–2 weeks) with a comprehensive epilepsy center/epileptologist. If you can’t get in quickly and the speech/memory issues are worsening, go to the ER.\n\nHow to find the right clinic\n- Look for an NAEC Level 3 or 4 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (in the U.S., naec-epilepsy.org has a locator).\n- Tell the scheduler: “I have treatment‑resistant epilepsy, new progressive language and memory problems, and a history of seizure clusters with apnea. I need urgent evaluation and video‑EEG monitoring.”\n\nTests that are typically needed\n- Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol on a 3T scanner (to look for subtle lesions like cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, scar tissue)\n- Prolonged video‑EEG monitoring (inpatient if possible) to capture events and check for subclinical seizures and where they start\n- Neuropsychological testing to objectively measure language and memory and help localize dysfunction\n- Blood tests: CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate, vitamin D; consider ESR/CRP; if indicated, ammonia; infectious screens based on history\n- Autoimmune/encephalitis evaluation if suggested by your neurologist (serum ± CSF panels such as NMDA‑R, LGI1, CASPR2, GAD65, etc.)\n- Sleep assessment if you snore or are very sleepy (sleep apnea can worsen seizures and cognition)\n\nTreatment options to discuss\n- Re‑trying therapy is important. Even if five meds didn’t help or caused side effects, there are newer choices and different combinations with better tolerability (examples: lacosamide, brivaracetam, cenobamate, clobazam, perampanel; choice depends on seizure type and your history). Uncontrolled generalized seizures carry risks (injury, cognitive harm, SUDEP), so the goal is seizure reduction.\n- A rescue medicine for clusters (e.g., intranasal midazolam or diazepam) so you and someone close to you can treat clusters at home and reduce ER visits.\n- If seizures start from one area, surgery may be an option; if not, neuromodulation can help: VNS (vagus nerve stimulation), RNS (responsive neurostimulation), or DBS.\n- Dietary therapy (modified Atkins or ketogenic) supervised by an epilepsy team can reduce seizures for some.\n- Speech‑language therapy and cognitive rehabilitation to address aphasia and memory strategies while medical causes are treated.\n\nSafety and SUDEP risk reduction\n- Don’t drive until cleared (laws vary, commonly require 6–12 months seizure‑free).\n- Avoid swimming alone, heights, bathtubs; use showers with a door that opens out.\n- Consistent sleep, no binge alcohol or recreational stimulants; avoid seizure‑provoking meds (e.g., bupropion, tramadol) unless cleared.\n- Nighttime supervision or a seizure‑alert device can help detect nocturnal events and apnea.\n- Make a seizure action plan and share it with family/friends/coworkers.\n\nBring to your appointment\n- A seizure and symptom diary: dates, time of day, triggers, duration, recovery, and whether language or memory problems worsen around events\n- List of all antiseizure meds tried and what happened (dose, side effects)\n- Any phone videos of your typical spells or the speech “getting stuck”\n- Past records/MRIs if you have them\n\nA few clarifying questions that help tailor evaluation\n- Are you right- or left‑handed? (helps infer language dominance)\n- Do the language problems fluctuate with seizures or sleep deprivation, or are they constant?\n- Any head injuries, infections, new exposures, or autoimmune symptoms?\n- Do you snore or stop breathing during sleep apart from seizures?\n\nBottom line: Your current symptoms are concerning but actionable. Re‑engaging with an epilepsy specialty center promptly is the best way to diagnose what’s driving the language and memory decline and to find a treatment plan that reduces seizures and protects brain function. If you want, share your city/region and I can help locate nearby comprehensive epilepsy centers.",

    "question": "Age/Sex: 20M Height: 5' 10\" Weight: 175 lbs About a month ago I swallowed roughly 42 grams of keppra. I eventually vomited, fell asleep, and woke up feeling pretty normal. I'm curious if there should be any hidden Long-term Health effects caused by my consumption of that much keppra that may not be obvious such as kidney, liver, or brain problems. Additionally, I am curious how likely it is I would have died from consuming that much Keppra and if a death from keppra would be painful.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you went through that. Thank you for sharing it here. I want to make sure you’re safe—are you having any thoughts about harming yourself now?\n\nAbout long-term effects from a one-time large levetiracetam (Keppra) overdose:\n- Kidneys: Levetiracetam is cleared mainly by the kidneys. In the absence of complications like severe dehydration, rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), or low blood pressure, lasting kidney damage from a single episode is unlikely. If you haven’t noticed reduced urination, leg swelling, or persistent fatigue since then, that’s reassuring.\n- Liver: Levetiracetam isn’t known to be hard on the liver, and clinically significant liver injury from it is rare. Lasting liver problems from a single overdose would be unusual.\n- Brain/neurologic: Acute effects are usually sleepiness, dizziness, agitation, or confusion. Permanent brain injury is not expected unless there were complications such as prolonged low oxygen, severe low blood pressure, or head injury. If you’ve felt mentally “back to normal” and haven’t had persistent changes in memory, concentration, mood, or new neurologic symptoms, that’s reassuring.\n\nWhat I’d recommend now (to be thorough):\n- See a clinician for a check-in and basic labs: kidney function (creatinine, BUN), liver panel (AST/ALT/bilirubin), electrolytes, and a urinalysis. A simple exam and these tests can confirm there’s no hidden injury.\n- Seek care promptly if you notice warning signs: very dark urine or muscle pain/weakness, marked fatigue, yellowing of eyes/skin, abdominal pain, confusion, fainting, new or worsening mood changes, or decreased urination.\n- If you’re prescribed levetiracetam for seizures, don’t stop it abruptly—sudden discontinuation can increase seizure risk. Talk with your prescriber about what happened and how you’re feeling.\n\nAbout “how likely it is you would have died” or whether a death from levetiracetam would be painful: I can’t help with details about lethality or what dying from an overdose is like. Overdoses are unpredictable and can be dangerous, and if these thoughts are on your mind, it could help to talk with someone who can support you right now.\n\nIf you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) anytime for confidential support. If you’re outside the U.S., please consider your local emergency number or visit findahelpline.com to find resources in your country. If you feel in immediate danger, call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency department.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, let me know where you are and whether you’re safe right now.

In the picture you see two on my left side, there can be another one on the left tip and the same can be mirrored on the right side. The most I had at the same time were 3 of these.

They start small, get bigger and then develop a white \"ring\" instead of the red (in the photo), after this state the tongue gets white and the whole mouth has an unpleasant taste. But I would actually say I have good oral hygiene. Could this be related to one of my diseases, or could it be a side effect or something completely unrelated? I've already asked one of my doctors but he had no idea what this could be (out of his field). Which doctor would you suggest visiting, a dermatologist? I'm hoping to find someone here to help me out. I would be thankful for any ideas about what this might be, how to reduce the pain (except for standard painkillers) or to prevent it completely. Compared to my diseases it's not really that bad of course, but another annoying thing that might trigger despair.",
    "answer": "Short answer: What you describe (red, burning patches on the tongue that move around and develop a thin white border, occurring in different spots and flaring 1–3×/month) is most consistent with “geographic tongue” (benign migratory glossitis). It’s harmless but can be painful. With your immunosuppression, a superimposed oral yeast infection (thrush) can sometimes follow a flare and cause a white coating and bad taste.\n\nWhy this fits and what else to consider:\n- Geographic tongue\n  - Typical features: smooth, red, tender patches with a thin, slightly raised white/cream border that change size/location over days to weeks; burning with spicy/acidic/salty foods.\n  - Often flares with stress, illness, hormonal changes; more common in people with autoimmune conditions. It’s not infectious or precancerous.\n- Things to rule out (because you’re on rituximab and steroids)\n  - Oral candidiasis (thrush): removable white coating, burning, bad taste; risk increased by steroids and PPI. Can overlay geographic tongue during/after flares.\n  - Aphthous ulcers (IBD-related): round/oval shallow ulcers with yellow-gray base and red halo that stay in one spot until they heal.\n  - Oral lichen planus or drug‑related lichenoid reactions: lacy white lines or persistent erosions.\n  - Viral ulcers (HSV/CMV) if lesions are deep, clustered, or you have fever.\n\nWho to see in Austria\n- Best first stop: a dentist with training in oral medicine/oral pathology (Universitätszahnklinik/Oralmedizin) or an oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic (Mund‑, Kiefer‑ und Gesichtschirurgie). An ENT or a dermatologist experienced in oral mucosa is also appropriate.\n- Bring clear photos of flares, a list of all meds, and note timing vs. rituximab infusions.\n\nUseful checks\n- Swab/culture if a white coating is present to confirm Candida.\n- Blood tests for contributors to burning tongue: CBC, ferritin/iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, HbA1c/fasting glucose.\n- Review for dry mouth (many meds can cause it), which worsens burning and thrush.\n\nSelf-care and pain reduction\n- Avoid common triggers during flares: spicy, acidic (citrus, tomato, pineapple), very hot foods/drinks, alcohol, mint/cinnamon flavorings, nuts; avoid strong mouthwashes and SLS-containing toothpaste. Choose SLS-free toothpaste and a bland alcohol-free rinse.\n- Rinses: warm saltwater or baking soda (1/2 tsp in a glass of warm water) 3–4×/day.\n- Topical anesthetic before meals: a tiny amount of 2% viscous lidocaine applied with a cotton swab to the sore areas, then avoid eating for 30 minutes. Do not exceed label dose; numbness increases bite risk.\n- Short course topical anti-inflammatory during painful flares: triamcinolone 0.1% dental paste (thin film to the border of the patch up to 3–4×/day for 3–5 days). Given your immunosuppression, keep courses short and stop if you notice a new white coating—then treat for thrush.\n- If thrush is suspected (removable white coating, sore/burning mouth, bad taste): ask for nystatin oral suspension or clotrimazole troches. Avoid starting fluconazole without prescriber input—azole antifungals can interact with perampanel and lacosamide.\n- Manage dry mouth: frequent sips of water, sugar-free xylitol gum/lozenges, saliva substitutes.\n- Consider checking and correcting deficiencies (iron, B12, folate, zinc) if low.\n\nMedication/disease links\n- Autoimmune background (SLE/Crohn’s) may predispose to geographic tongue and aphthous-type ulcers.\n- Immunosuppression (rituximab, steroids, PPI) raises yeast/viral infection risk.\n- Your current antiseizure meds rarely cause oral ulcers; true drug reactions usually look different and persist rather than “migrate.”\n\nWhen to seek prompt care\n- Lesions persisting >3 weeks in one spot, rapidly spreading ulcers, high fever, difficulty swallowing, inability to maintain hydration/nutrition, or severe white plaques that bleed when wiped.\n\nBottom line: This most likely is geographic tongue with possible intermittent thrush. An oral medicine clinic (or MKG/ENT/derm with oral expertise) can confirm quickly, rule out infections, and prescribe targeted topical therapy. In the meantime, use trigger avoidance, bland rinses, and topical anesthetic; consider short bursts of dental steroid paste for painful flares and antifungal treatment if a white coating appears.",

    "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy’s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year’s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it’s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:“ The episodes that she is having are not seizures.“ “It is probably from depression or some psychological problems.” (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona‘s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it’s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I’m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry Fiona and your whole family are going through this. I can’t diagnose her, but I can share what often explains a pattern like this, what tests/treatments are usually helpful, and what you can do at home while you push for answers.\n\nWhat stands out in Fiona’s story\n- Episodes are frequent and long (10–50 minutes, sometimes many times a day), with shaking/twitching, light sensitivity, feeling hot, trouble breathing, and sometimes at predictable times.\n- She had headaches first, took pain medicine frequently, then stopped, and the episodes continued.\n- Doctors have seen events and said they’re “not epileptic seizures.”\n\nWhy doctors might say “not epileptic seizures”\n- True epileptic seizures that last this long or happen this often typically show clear changes on EEG and usually come with a period of deep confusion/sleepiness afterward. Long, frequent events with fluctuating intensity and preserved breathing often turn out to be:\n  - Migraine-related phenomena (migraine with brainstem aura, hemiplegic migraine, vestibular migraine), sometimes with dramatic sensory/motor symptoms.\n  - Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), also called functional seizures. These are real, involuntary events caused by a brain network dysfunction (not “faking”), often triggered by pain, stress, lights, or hyperventilation. PNES can coexist with migraine and even with epilepsy, which is why careful testing matters.\n  - Syncope/orthostatic intolerance (like POTS) can cause fainting or near-fainting with shaking, numbness, breathing changes, and light sensitivity.\n  - Medication-overuse headache (from using pain relievers too often) can transform migraines into near-daily severe headaches and can trigger spiraling symptoms, even after stopping.\n\nConditions to consider and rule out\n- Primary: migraine variants; PNES/functional neurological disorder; orthostatic intolerance/POTS or vasovagal syncope.\n- Also to exclude: epileptic seizures (focal or generalized), sleep disorders, metabolic issues (low glucose, sodium, calcium, magnesium), cardiac rhythm problems.\n\nWhat to ask for next\n1) Pediatric comprehensive epilepsy center evaluation\n- Prolonged video-EEG monitoring (ideally 24–72 hours or until one of her typical events is captured). This is the gold standard to tell epileptic from nonepileptic events.\n- If not yet done, brain MRI to check structure.\n\n2) Pediatric headache clinic\n- Build a migraine plan:\n  - Avoid medication overuse: limit acetaminophen/ibuprofen to no more than 2–3 days per week.\n  - Age-appropriate acute meds (e.g., ibuprofen or naproxen; some triptans like rizatriptan are approved in kids). Antinausea meds if needed.\n  - Preventive options (chosen by her neurologist): cyproheptadine (often used in younger kids), amitriptyline, topiramate, propranolol, or non-drug options (biofeedback, CBT).\n  - Lifestyle: regular sleep, hydration, meals, exercise, reduced screen glare.\n\n3) Orthostatic intolerance/syncope workup\n- Orthostatic vitals (lying/sitting/standing), ECG. Consider referral to cardiology/autonomic clinic if she has dizziness, palpitations, or fainting spells.\n- In the meantime: good hydration, salt intake (if no contraindications), slow position changes, compression socks.\n\n4) Functional seizure/FND pathway if EEG shows events are nonepileptic\n- Important: functional seizures are real and treatable. A clinician experienced in pediatric FND can guide targeted therapy (often CBT plus physiotherapy/occupational therapy). Treating her migraines and reducing triggers is part of this.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Keep a detailed log and video:\n  - Time, trigger (lights, stress, pain, hunger), any warning/aura (numbness, visual spots), what movements happen (are eyes open/closed), color/breathing, responsiveness, duration, recovery.\n  - Good-quality phone videos that show her face and whole body help doctors tremendously.\n\n- Create a home plan for episodes:\n  - If she’s safe: dim lights, reduce noise, offer a cool cloth, encourage slow nasal breathing with longer exhales (e.g., 4 seconds in, 6–8 seconds out).\n  - Do not restrain limbs or put anything in her mouth.\n  - If she becomes unresponsive and not breathing or turns blue, call 911 immediately.\n\n- Headache hygiene:\n  - Sleep: consistent schedule; avoid weekend “catch-up” sleep.\n  - Hydration: aim for clear urine most of the day; consider an electrolyte drink during active days.\n  - Regular meals; don’t skip breakfast. Watch common triggers (dehydration, heat, bright/flickering light, strong smells).\n  - Screen adjustments: lower brightness, use night mode, take frequent breaks.\n\n- Be careful with acetaminophen dosing:\n  - At ~75 lb (34 kg), a typical dose is 10–15 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours as needed, maximum 75 mg/kg/day (up to 2.5 g/day for her weight). But try to keep total use to <=2–3 days per week to avoid medication-overuse headache.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New severe “worst-ever” headache; headache with fever, neck stiffness, rash, or head injury.\n- A spell with prolonged unresponsiveness and abnormal breathing or skin turning blue.\n- Repeated events without recovery, or any new persistent weakness, trouble speaking, or confusion that doesn’t resolve.\n\nHow to talk about “it’s psychological”\n- If PNES/FND is raised, it does not mean “made up” or “attention-seeking.” The brain can generate very real seizure-like events without epileptic discharges, especially in kids under high pain/stress loads. Framing it as a brain network problem that is treatable helps everyone align on care. Treatment targets the nervous system’s threat/pain circuits and often improves faster when migraine and sleep are also well managed.\n\nGood places to seek care in/near Philadelphia\n- Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Pediatric Epilepsy Center and Headache Program are excellent. Ask specifically for admission to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit for video-EEG and for a coordinated plan between neurology, headache, and (if needed) FND specialists.\n\nIf you share more details (what her episodes look like on video, whether she’s responsive, what the EEG/MRI showed, what meds were tried), I can help you craft a focused checklist for her next appointment. You’re doing the right things advocating for her—keep pushing for a comprehensive pediatric neurology evaluation with video-EEG and a migraine plan.",

    "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re both going through this—waiting a week can feel endless. The MRI wording can also be scary, so here’s what it likely means and what to expect.\n\nWhat the MRI terms mean\n- Encephalomalacia = loss/softening of brain tissue; gliosis = “scar tissue” (reactive glial change) from prior injury or surgery. After a lesionectomy, a small area of encephalomalacia and gliosis right next to the surgical site is common and expected. It’s part of healing, not a sign of an active process.\n- Important: gliosis is not glioma. Your report says “gliosis” (scar), not a tumor. The line “No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement” is reassuring.\n- Amygdala/hippocampi look symmetric and normal—also reassuring (no mesial temporal sclerosis).\n\nHow this relates to the seizure\n- Even after successful surgery, some people have a seizure when antiseizure medications are tapered or stopped. The risk of recurrence after withdrawal is not trivial.\n- The scarred area can be electrically irritable and capable of generating seizures in some people, but many remain seizure-free despite such MRI changes.\n- A single, late, nocturnal tonic-clonic seizure after med withdrawal usually leads to restarting/titrating medication and watchful follow-up—not straight to another surgery.\n\nWhat treatment paths typically look like\n- Most epileptologists first optimize medications (for example, lacosamide/Vimpat 200 mg twice daily is a common total dose of 400 mg/day; your team will tailor this).\n- Many patients who have a recurrence after stopping meds regain seizure freedom once medication is restarted or adjusted.\n- Further surgery is generally only considered if seizures continue despite adequate trials of two appropriate medications (drug-resistant epilepsy) and if testing shows a clear target. Your MRI does not show a new lesion to remove.\n\nWhat to ask at the upcoming visit\n- Are the encephalomalacia/gliosis changes expected post-op and stable compared with prior imaging?\n- What is the plan for medication dosing and monitoring? Any need for a second agent or slow titration?\n- Should we get an EEG (routine or ambulatory) to check for ongoing epileptiform activity?\n- Do we need repeat MRI in 6–12 months to confirm stability?\n- Can we have a rescue medication (e.g., nasal midazolam) and an action plan for prolonged seizures?\n- Driving and safety guidance specific to our state/country (many require a seizure-free interval, often 3–12 months).\n- Any evaluation for possible triggers (sleep deprivation, alcohol, illness, interacting meds) and whether to screen for sleep apnea if there’s snoring or witnessed pauses in breathing.\n\nSafety until you see the neurologist\n- Strict medication adherence; prioritize regular sleep; avoid alcohol/intoxicants; manage illness/fever promptly; stay well hydrated.\n- Shower instead of bath; don’t swim alone; avoid heights, open flames, or operating dangerous machinery.\n- Nighttime: consider a seizure-detection device/app if helpful; keep the bed area safe; place him on his side if a seizure occurs.\n- Seek emergency care if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, repeats without full recovery, involves injury or breathing problems, or if there’s a new neurological deficit afterward.\n\nBottom line\n- The MRI description (small encephalomalacia/gliosis at the resection margin, no mass, normal hippocampi) is a typical postoperative finding and not a tumor.\n- One breakthrough seizure after being off medication does not, by itself, mean another surgery is needed. The usual next step is optimizing antiseizure medication and monitoring. Many people regain seizure freedom with this approach.\n\nIf you can share any additional details (e.g., current exact lacosamide schedule, any potential triggers that night, how long the seizure lasted, recovery time), I can help you refine questions for your appointment.",

    "question": "42 F Lamictal, cymbalta, singulair, levothyroxine, Pepcid, ambien 200lbs (significant weight gain in 3 years after injury to cervical spine - unable to run like I used to so I’m confident that is the main reason why) 3-4 drinks per year, past prescription drug use (all prescribed but over used/abused) no addictive medications for almost 2 years besides ambien but now I’m very careful. Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I’m medicated and I haven’t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I’ve noticed I started to “feel things I see”. It’s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I’m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn’t think it’s a seizure but it’s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it’s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren’t “normal”. Thanks to all the doctors who visit this sub and offer help!",
    "answer": "Short answer: synesthesia is real, well-studied, and not pseudoscience. What you’re describing sounds most like a benign “vicarious sensation”/mirror-touch type of synesthesia and vivid cross-sensory imagery, which can show up or become more noticeable after brain changes (including epilepsy, head/neck injury, or medication changes). It does not by itself mean a mental disorder or that things will “take a downward turn,” especially since your experiences are pleasant, predictable, and don’t impair you.\n\nWhat synesthesia is\n- A stable, automatic cross-talk between senses (e.g., seeing something reliably evokes a tactile, temperature, or smell sensation). It’s been replicated in labs for decades with objective tests (e.g., consistency over time, Stroop-like effects) and imaging (cross-activation between sensory areas; increased structural connectivity). It often runs in families.\n- Variants include mirror-touch/vicarious pain (feeling a light touch or ache when you see someone touched or hurt) and visual-evoked temperature sensations. Many people also have vivid olfactory/temperature imagery (“I can smell/feel that place” when seeing it).\n\nWhy this might be happening now\n- Epilepsy and its treatment change brain networks. Some people develop or notice synesthesia-like experiences after seizures become controlled, after injury, or with certain meds. That doesn’t automatically mean a problem; it can be a “release” of cross-sensory processing that was always there or newly unmasked.\n- Your pattern—triggered by watching scenes, brief, pleasant, with clear external cues and intact awareness—fits synesthetic/vicarious responses much more than seizures or psychosis.\n\nWhen to tell your neurologist sooner\n- Episodes that occur out of the blue (not triggered by seeing something), especially:\n  - Sudden odd smells/tastes that aren’t there (burning rubber, metallic) with confusion or awareness changes\n  - Déjà vu/jamais vu spells, rising “stomach” sensation, time gaps, automatisms (lip smacking, fumbling)\n  - New anxiety surges or panic-like spells out of context\n  - Experiences becoming intrusive, distressing, or impairing\nThese can point toward temporal lobe seizure activity and would merit EEG review or med adjustment.\n\nMedication notes (just to be aware)\n- Zolpidem (Ambien) can cause vivid perceptual phenomena or hallucinations, especially with sleep deprivation or higher doses. If your experiences occur only when awake, focused, and are consistent over time, this is less likely the cause, but mention it to your prescriber.\n- Montelukast (Singulair) has rare neuropsychiatric side effects; report any mood, sleep, or perceptual changes that concern you.\n- Duloxetine and lamotrigine aren’t typical causes of this pattern, and lamotrigine is commonly used in epilepsy.\n\nWhat you can do\n- Keep a brief log for a few weeks: triggers (what you saw), what you felt/smelled, which body side/location, duration, and whether you stayed fully aware. Synesthesia tends to be automatic, specific, and very consistent across time (e.g., seeing touch to someone’s left cheek always maps to your right cheek).\n- Bring the log to your neurologist. If there are no red flags and your seizures remain controlled, reassurance is usually all that’s needed.\n- Optimize sleep and avoid missed doses/alcohol binges, as these can unmask seizures or intensify perceptual phenomena.\n\nBottom line: Your description fits a benign, well-documented cross-sensory phenomenon rather than a deteriorating mental condition. Keep an eye out for the seizure red flags above, but if what you’re experiencing remains pleasant, stimulus-bound, and non-impairing, it’s generally safe to regard it as synesthetic/vicarious sensation.",

    "question": " Hello! I am a 51M and have had left temporal lobe epilepsy my whole life. I weight 130 pounds and I am 5’6”. I recently had an MRI done as I have had increased migraines and headaches. Here are my medications:    Lamotrigine    Topomax    Propranolol    UbrelvyMy MRI report came back and I have noticed new impressions and findings in it. I was wondering if someone could alleviate some anxiety and explain what these things mean. Specifically, the “Brain” and “Impression” portions of the report.Thank you very much in advance. COMPARISON: MRI brain dated 12/05/2018   TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence images were obtained of the brain without administration of intravenous contrast.    FINDINGS:   HEMORRHAGE: No acute parenchymal, subarachnoid or extra-axial hemorrhage.    DWI: No evidence of acute or early subacute infarction.    BRAIN: No mass effect or edema. No significant atrophy or chronic microvascular ischemic changes. Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right.    VENTRICLES: Unremarkable. No hydrocephalus.    CALVARIUM: Unremarkable.    PARANASAL SINUSES: Unremarkable.    MASTOID AIR CELLS: Unremarkable.    OTHER FINDINGS: None.    IMPRESSION:   Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right which may be related to microvascular ischemic change with demyelinating disease not excluded.",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing the report. I’ll translate the key parts you asked about and put them in context for a 51-year-old with migraines and a history of left temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nWhat “Brain” means in your report:\n- “No mass effect or edema”: No tumor, large lesion, or swelling.\n- “No significant atrophy”: No notable shrinkage of brain tissue.\n- “No chronic microvascular ischemic changes”: No widespread small-vessel “wear-and-tear” changes.  \n- “Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right”: There are a few tiny bright spots in the white matter on the right side. “Punctate” means very small. These are common, nonspecific findings.\n\nWhat the “Impression” means:\n- “Few punctate foci … which may be related to microvascular ischemic change”: The most likely explanation is tiny changes from small blood vessels or from migraines. These are very common in people over 40 and in migraine sufferers, and usually do not cause symptoms or require treatment beyond managing risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, sleep apnea).\n- “With demyelinating disease not excluded”: This is a cautious, standard phrase meaning the MRI alone can’t 100% rule out conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS). However, your report does not describe features that are typical of MS (such as multiple ovoid lesions along the ventricles/corpus callosum, callosal “Dawson’s fingers,” juxtacortical or infratentorial lesions, or spinal cord lesions). In a 51-year-old with migraines, a few small spots are far more often benign/migraine- or small-vessel–related than demyelinating disease.\n\nBig-picture reassurance:\n- No stroke: “DWI: No evidence of acute or early subacute infarction.”\n- No bleeding.\n- No hydrocephalus, no mass, and no swelling.\n- The small white-matter spots are a very common finding at your age, especially with migraines, and they are usually clinically insignificant.\n- These spots are unlikely to explain seizures or represent a new epilepsy-related lesion. Nothing in the report points to a new structural cause for seizures.\n\nWhy the “microvascular” mention differs slightly between sections:\n- The “Brain” section says no significant chronic small-vessel disease (meaning no heavy or diffuse burden).\n- The “Impression” notes a few tiny spots that could represent very mild small-vessel changes. Those two statements are consistent.\n\nWhat to do next:\n- Ask your neurologist or the radiologist whether these spots were present on your 2018 MRI and if they’ve changed. Stability over time is very reassuring.\n- If you’ve had symptoms suggestive of demyelination (episodes lasting >24 hours of vision loss/pain in one eye, double vision, numbness/weakness on one side, balance problems, Lhermitte’s sign—an electric shock-like sensation down the back when bending the neck), tell your neurologist. If concern remains, an MRI with an MS protocol (and sometimes with contrast) can be considered.\n- Optimize vascular and migraine risk factors: blood pressure, lipids, glucose/A1c, exercise, sleep, treat sleep apnea if present, don’t smoke.\n- For migraines: these white-matter spots don’t mean damage is ongoing. If your headaches are increasing, review your prevention (topiramate, propranolol) and acute use (ubrogepant). Gepants have low medication-overuse risk, but frequent use still merits a prevention tune-up.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care:\n- Thunderclap headache (worst headache of life, peaks in seconds to minutes), new weakness/numbness on one side, new speech trouble, persistent vision loss, or a severe headache unlike your usual migraines.\n\nIf you can share whether the 2018 scan had similar findings or if your current migraines have changed character, I can help you think through whether more imaging or a different headache plan makes sense.",

    "question": "23M, 6’5 and wondering if liquid nytol is okay to use with a very mild form of epilepsy (no seizures) that is triggered by light.On no other medications but have ADHD and anxiety and can’t sleep anymore",
    "answer": "Short answer: I wouldn’t recommend Liquid Nytol for you without your neurologist/GP’s okay.\n\nWhy: Most “Nytol” sleep products (including the liquid in the UK) contain diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine and similar first‑generation antihistamines (like doxylamine) can lower the seizure threshold. They’ve been linked to provoking seizures, especially in people with a seizure disorder or photosensitivity. Your height doesn’t make it safer, and using more is not safer.\n\nSafer options to consider\n- Melatonin: 1–3 mg about 60–90 minutes before bed for sleep-onset problems. If your body clock is shifted late (common with ADHD), 0.5–1 mg 4–5 hours before your target bedtime can help shift it earlier. Melatonin is generally considered safe in epilepsy and sometimes used clinically, but still let your clinician know.\n- Non-drug strategies (often as effective as meds):\n  - Fixed wake time every day; avoid daytime naps.\n  - 30–60 minute wind‑down routine; keep lights dim and screens filtered or off.\n  - Morning bright light (outdoors 20–30 min soon after waking).\n  - Limit caffeine after late morning; avoid alcohol for sleep.\n  - CBT‑I (apps or brief therapy) if insomnia is frequent.\n- Address ADHD/anxiety contributors: If you’re ever on stimulants, take them early; therapy or SSRIs/SNRIs for anxiety may help sleep long‑term under a clinician’s guidance.\n\nPhotosensitive‑epilepsy tips for evenings\n- Keep rooms well lit when using screens to reduce contrast; lower screen brightness; use high‑refresh‑rate displays; avoid rapidly flashing content.\n- Consider blue‑blocking/tinted lenses known to help photosensitivity; avoid strobe environments; cover one eye if unexpectedly exposed to flashing lights.\n\nIf you still feel you need a short‑term sleep aid, speak with your GP/neurologist. There are prescription options they may consider that are safer in epilepsy than OTC antihistamines. Avoid combining any sedative with alcohol or other sedatives.\n\nUrgent reasons to seek care\n- Any seizure or pre‑seizure symptoms after taking a sleep aid.\n- Going 2–3 nights with almost no sleep plus worsening anxiety, confusion, or suicidal thoughts.\n\nQuick clarifications that would help me tailor advice:\n- Which country are you in and what exact “Liquid Nytol” product/ingredient do you have?\n- When was your last seizure (if any), and who diagnosed the photosensitive epilepsy?\n- How long has the insomnia been going on, and what does a typical night look like?\n- Any caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or energy drink use in the afternoon/evening?",

    "question": " 50F in Australia, on carbimazole and levetiracetam for Graves’ and epilepsy, respectively. FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It’s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn’t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I’ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I’m not convinced it’s that urgent. It’s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here’s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
    "answer": "Short answer: because your pain is at the base of the thumb after a FOOSH, a scaphoid or first metacarpal base fracture (or a scapholunate ligament injury) is possible. These can look mild but do better with prompt immobilization. If you can immobilize the wrist and thumb now and you have no red flags (below), it’s usually okay to wait until Monday for imaging. If you can’t immobilize it properly, or certain findings are present, go to ED today for X‑ray and a proper thumb‑spica splint.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Scaphoid fractures often don’t show dramatic swelling and may be missed on the first X‑ray. Early immobilization (thumb‑spica) reduces the risk of non‑union and chronic pain.\n- Base‑of‑thumb (Bennett) fractures and significant ligament injuries also benefit from urgent immobilization and assessment.\n\nRed flags — go to ED today if any apply:\n- Marked deformity, rapidly increasing swelling, or you can’t move your thumb/fingers.\n- Persistent numbness/tingling, cold/pale/blue fingers, or capillary refill >2 seconds.\n- Severe pain not controlled with simple painkillers.\n- Deep cuts or suspected open fracture.\n- Very focal bony tenderness in the “anatomical snuffbox” (the hollow at the base of the thumb) or pain when pressing down along the thumb (axial load) after a FOOSH — this strongly suggests a scaphoid injury and merits same‑day splinting and imaging.\n\nIf you choose to wait until Monday:\n- Immobilize now in a thumb‑spica:\n  - Ideal: buy a thumb‑spica wrist brace from a pharmacy.\n  - If not available: improvise with a rigid support (e.g., clean ruler/paint stirrer) along the thumb and forearm, wrap with an elastic bandage to keep the wrist neutral and the thumb immobilized. Not too tight.\n- Remove rings from that hand now (swelling can trap them).\n- RICE: rest, ice 15–20 min every 2–3 hours, compression (light), elevate above heart.\n- Pain relief: paracetamol (acetaminophen) as directed; you can add ibuprofen with food if you normally tolerate NSAIDs. Avoid tramadol (can lower seizure threshold).\n- Keep it immobilized continuously until you’re seen, even if pain eases.\n\nImaging and follow‑up\n- Ask for wrist X‑rays with a scaphoid series. If X‑rays are negative but you have classic scaphoid tenderness, you’ll usually be kept in a thumb‑spica and either re‑X‑rayed in 10–14 days or sent for MRI/CT.\n- If a fracture/major ligament injury is found, you’ll need ortho/hand follow‑up.\n\nWound (road rash) care on the palm\n- Rinse with running water and mild soap; gently remove debris.\n- Apply a thin layer of plain petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment; cover with a non‑adherent dressing; change daily.\n- Watch for infection (increasing redness, warmth, swelling, pus, fever). Given you’re on carbimazole (rare risk of low white cells), seek care promptly if you develop fever or feel unwell.\n- Tetanus: get a booster if it’s been >10 years (or >5 years for a dirty wound).\n\nBottom line: If you can get a proper thumb‑spica on now and have no red flags, waiting until Monday is reasonable. If you can’t immobilize it, or you have snuffbox tenderness/axial thumb pain or any neurovascular concerns, go to ED today for X‑ray and splinting.",

    "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",
    "answer": "Short answer: maternal “shaking” during labor does not cause a newborn to have seizures days later. That explanation is not physiologically plausible. Newborn shaking can be benign in some cases, but recurrent events in the first days of life always deserve a careful work‑up and close monitoring until the cause is clarified.\n\nWhat it could be instead\n- Benign neonatal jitteriness or tremor: common, looks like shivering, is brought on by stimulation/crying, and stops if you gently hold or flex the involved limb. No eye deviation, color change, or breathing pauses.\n- Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus: jerks only during sleep that cease immediately on awakening; baby otherwise well.\n- True neonatal seizures: typically do not stop when you hold the limb, can be focal (one arm/leg or one side), may have eye deviation, lip smacking, apnea, color change, or poor responsiveness. These usually start within the first 24–72 hours of life and are never “nothing” until proven otherwise.\n\nCommon causes doctors look for\n- Low blood sugar, calcium, magnesium, or sodium (hypoglycemia/hypocalcemia are frequent and treatable; hypocalcemia often appears days 3–7).\n- Infection (sepsis, meningitis; herpes simplex virus can present with seizures around days 5–14).\n- Perinatal stroke (not rare; often presents 12–72 hours after birth with focal seizures; ultrasound can be normal—MRI is better).\n- Intracranial hemorrhage, hypoxic‑ischemic injury.\n- Medication or substance exposure/withdrawal (opioids, benzodiazepines, SSRIs), though these more often cause jitteriness than true seizures.\n- Inborn errors of metabolism; rare but important (e.g., pyridoxine/B6‑dependent seizures).\n\nReasonable evaluation steps\n- Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring in hospital until events are clearly diagnosed and controlled.\n- Labs: bedside glucose; serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium; CBC, CRP; consider blood culture. If concern for infection, lumbar puncture for CSF and start empiric antibiotics ± acyclovir while awaiting results.\n- If events persist or exam suggests focality: brain MRI with diffusion (cranial ultrasound is a limited screen and can be normal in stroke).\n- EEG, ideally continuous video‑EEG, to capture an event. Routine short EEGs can miss intermittent seizures; “brain activity good” may mean an aEEG or EEG was normal between events.\n- If no cause found and seizures continue: ammonia, lactate, serum amino acids, acylcarnitine profile, urine organic acids; consider a trial of pyridoxine under monitoring.\n\nTreatment\n- Treat the cause (e.g., correct glucose, calcium, magnesium; treat infection).\n- If events are true seizures, many centers use phenobarbital or levetiracetam. If the spells prove to be benign jitteriness or sleep myoclonus, anti‑seizure meds are not needed.\n\nWhat you and the family can do right now\n- Ask the team to keep the baby inpatient with monitoring until there is a clear diagnosis and the baby has been event‑free for a period of time.\n- Ask specifically for continuous video‑EEG to capture an event, or at least to review a good-quality phone video of the spells.\n- Clarify what imaging was done (ultrasound vs MRI) and whether electrolytes/glucose were abnormal. Ask if infection (including HSV) has been reasonably ruled out.\n- If there’s disagreement among clinicians, request a pediatric neurology review or a second opinion, or transfer to a NICU if not already in one.\n\nWhen to treat as an emergency\n- Any event lasting more than 3–5 minutes, repeated back‑to‑back without recovery, color change (blue/gray), apnea, poor feeding, extreme sleepiness, fever, or decreased responsiveness warrants immediate medical attention.\n\nBottom line\n- Your skepticism about the “maternal shakiness” explanation is warranted.\n- However, some newborn movement disorders are benign; distinguishing them from seizures requires careful observation and often EEG.\n- Most common causes are identifiable and treatable, and outcomes depend on the underlying cause and prompt management.\n\nIf you can share a description of what the movements look like (or whether they stop when the limb is held, whether there’s eye deviation or color change, whether they happen only during sleep), I can help you think through whether they sound more like jitteriness versus seizures.",

    "question": "So I'm an 18 yr old Caucasian male (62kg,180cm). Since some months ago, I have constant depersonalization/dereaalization and periods of confusion that really bother me. I went to a neurologist and had an MRI scan(which turned out fine, except for some normal anatomical variants) and I was wondering if my confusion and dpdr can be the result of epilepsy ?(non-convulsive seizures). Thanks!",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—DP/DR can feel very unsettling, especially when it’s persistent.\n\nCould it be epilepsy?\n- It’s possible, but less likely if the depersonalization/derealization is constant for months. Epileptic symptoms are usually brief, sudden, and stereotyped episodes that last seconds to minutes, sometimes followed by minutes of confusion and fatigue.\n- Temporal lobe (focal) seizures can cause déjà vu/jamais vu, time distortion, a “dreamlike” feeling, sudden fear, odd smells/tastes, a rising stomach sensation, staring, lip smacking, or picking movements, often with impaired awareness and memory gaps. These come and go, not continuously.\n- Non‑convulsive status epilepticus causes continuous confusion for hours, but that’s an emergency and doesn’t typically persist for months without other changes.\n- A normal MRI does not rule out epilepsy. EEG (especially sleep‑deprived, ambulatory, or video EEG) is the key test.\n\nWhat’s more common with DP/DR:\n- Persistent or fluctuating detachment lasting weeks to months, intact orientation, ability to converse, and preserved insight (“I know this feels unreal but it isn’t”).\n- Often linked with anxiety/panic, stress, sleep deprivation, depression, trauma, migraine, or substances (especially cannabis or psychedelics). It can also follow illness or significant stress.\n- Medications or withdrawals (stimulants, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics) can contribute.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Neurology: Ask about an EEG. If your episodes are frequent, ambulatory 24–72 h or inpatient video‑EEG can be more revealing than a routine EEG.\n- Track episodes: When they start/stop, exact symptoms, triggers, awareness, memory, any automatisms, how long confusion lasts. If safe, have someone video an episode.\n- Basic labs (via your GP): CBC, electrolytes, glucose, thyroid (TSH), B12/folate; consider screening for sleep problems and migraine.\n- Mental health support: DP/DR often improves with treatment of anxiety/depression and with CBT. Grounding techniques and good sleep hygiene can help. Some people benefit from SSRIs/SNRIs; occasionally lamotrigine is used under specialist care.\n- Avoid triggers: Cannabis and psychedelics can precipitate or prolong DP/DR; limit caffeine; prioritize regular sleep, exercise, and stress reduction.\n\nSafety\n- If you’re having spells with impaired awareness, don’t drive, swim alone, or climb heights until cleared by your clinician.\n- Seek urgent care if you have a seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated events without full recovery, new weakness/speech trouble, severe headache, fever, head injury, or confusion that’s markedly worse.\n\nIf you want, tell me more about your episodes:\n- Are there sudden, repeating “spells” that are identical each time? How long?\n- Any staring, unresponsiveness, lip smacking, hand picking, or head turning?\n- Memory gaps around events?\n- Déjà vu/jamais vu, odd smells/tastes, rising stomach sensation, sudden fear?\n- Triggers like lack of sleep, stress, or hyperventilation?\n\nThose details can help your neurologist decide on the likelihood of seizures and the best testing plan.",

    "answer": "Short answer: the pattern you describe is most consistent with an autoimmune, vasculopathic, and hypercoagulable process—most notably antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), often occurring with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—with possible autoimmune kidney and tubular involvement causing potassium loss. Other important possibilities include thrombotic microangiopathy (e.g., TTP), ANCA‑associated vasculitis, mixed connective‑tissue disease, and less commonly hematologic or genetic thrombophilias. Normal complements do not rule out SLE.\n\nWhy APS/SLE are high on the list\n- Fits many features: seizures, suspected stroke with focal deficits, Raynaud’s, visual phenomena/scotomas, fluctuating kidney function, anemia, bruising, small clots, tachycardia/PVCs, positive ANA that’s rising, joint swelling (RF negative), aphasia/dysphagia.\n- APS can cause arterial and venous thrombosis, livedo-like skin changes, thrombocytopenia (bruising), migraines/visual auras, strokes/TIAs, seizures, and renal ischemic injury. It can exist alone (primary) or with SLE.\n- SLE can include seizures, strokes, cytopenias, renal disease, Raynaud’s, positive ANA; complements can be normal, especially outside of active nephritis.\n- Intermittent eGFR decline could reflect renal ischemia/microthrombi (APS nephropathy) or lupus nephritis; urinalysis is key.\n- Hypokalemia could be from autoimmune renal tubular acidosis (distal RTA), seen most in Sjögren’s but can occur in SLE; SSA/SSB negativity does not exclude Sjögren’s.\n\nOther conditions to consider\n- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): relapsing neurologic symptoms (seizures/strokes), renal dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bruising. Look for hemolysis (schistocytes, high LDH, low haptoglobin). Postpartum period can trigger. Urgent if suspected.\n- ANCA‑associated vasculitis: can cause renal injury, neuropathy, constitutional symptoms; test MPO/PR3.\n- Mixed connective tissue disease (anti‑U1‑RNP): Raynaud’s, joint swelling, dysphagia; CNS events less typical but possible.\n- Inherited/acquired thrombophilias: Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, protein C/S/antithrombin deficiency; plus PFO as an embolic source. These don’t explain ANA/Raynaud’s but can coexist.\n- Von Willebrand disease (given postpartum hemorrhage) could explain bleeding/bruising, but not clots; could coexist with a prothrombotic disorder.\n- B12/folate deficiency (macrocytosis/high MCH) can cause neurologic issues; easy to check.\n- Renal tubular disorders (Gitelman/Bartter) or hyperaldosteronism for hypokalemia; check acid–base status and urine electrolytes.\n- PNH (hemolysis + clots) less likely but consider if hemolysis present.\n\nRecommended next steps (prioritized)\n1) Seek prompt in‑person evaluation if any new/worsening neurologic symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, one‑sided vision loss, or if bruising/bleeding or kidney function worsens.\n\n2) Rheumatology and hematology referrals now; nephrology if urinalysis is abnormal or eGFR continues to fluctuate; neurology for seizure and prior stroke work‑up; ophthalmology for retinal exam.\n\n3) Laboratory workup\n- Autoimmune/vasculitis:\n  - ANA pattern and titer (already known), anti‑dsDNA, anti‑Sm, anti‑U1‑RNP, SSA/SSB (repeat), C3/C4 (repeat), ESR/CRP.\n  - Antiphospholipid panel: lupus anticoagulant (DRVVT/LA), anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, anti‑β2‑glycoprotein I IgG/IgM. Repeat at 12 weeks if positive to confirm APS.\n  - ANCA (MPO/PR3).\n- Kidney and electrolytes:\n  - CMP with potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate; venous/arterial blood gas if possible.\n  - Urinalysis with microscopy; urine protein/creatinine ratio; urine albumin/creatinine.\n  - Urine electrolytes (potassium, chloride) to determine renal potassium wasting; urine pH (persistent >5.5 with metabolic acidosis suggests distal RTA).\n- Hematology/coagulation:\n  - CBC with differential and peripheral smear; reticulocyte count; LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin (hemolysis screen).\n  - PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, D‑dimer.\n  - If thrombocytopenia/hemolysis: ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor (for TTP).\n  - Iron studies (ferritin, iron, TIBC), B12, folate, TSH.\n  - If bleeding history notable: von Willebrand panel (VWF antigen, activity/ristocetin, factor VIII).\n- Thrombophilia and embolic source (especially given young stroke):\n  - Genetic thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A) and protein C/S/antithrombin levels (ideally when not acutely ill and off anticoagulants).\n  - Echocardiogram with bubble study (evaluate for PFO) and cardiac rhythm monitoring as indicated.\n\n4) Imaging\n- Brain MRI with and without contrast and vascular imaging (MRA/CTA head/neck) if not done around the time of deficits; carotid/vertebral artery assessment.\n- Renal ultrasound; consider kidney biopsy if persistent proteinuria/active urine sediment or GFR declines.\n\n5) Management considerations to discuss with your doctors\n- If APS is confirmed with clinical events (stroke/TIA/clots) and persistent antibody positivity, long‑term anticoagulation is usually indicated.\n- If lupus or vasculitis is confirmed, immunosuppressive therapy tailored to organ involvement.\n- Treat correctable contributors: replenish magnesium (low Mg can sustain hypokalemia and cause arrhythmias), correct B12/folate/iron deficiencies, address any RTA.\n- Seizure management and safety; review meds/supplements for any that lower potassium or increase bleeding risk; avoid estrogen‑containing contraceptives until thrombosis risk is clarified.\n\nKey points\n- A rising ANA with Raynaud’s, neurologic events, renal fluctuations, cytopenias/bruising, and clotting strongly warrant repeat, targeted autoimmune and antiphospholipid testing; normal complements do not exclude SLE.\n- The combination of “clots plus bruising” suggests either APS with thrombocytopenia or a thrombotic microangiopathy—both need careful hematology input.\n- Chronic hypokalemia needs a renal vs non‑renal loss workup; autoimmune distal RTA is plausible in this context.\n\nIf you can share any prior lab trends (platelet counts, urinalysis findings, magnesium, bicarbonate, hemolysis markers) or imaging results, I can help narrow the differential and prioritize testing further.",

    "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry this has been so hard on your mum and family. The pattern you describe—frequent “staring” spells with lip smacking/chewing, confusion, injuries, and stress sensitivity—sounds more like focal impaired‑awareness (temporal‑lobe) seizures than classic absence seizures in adults. A few important possibilities can explain why things have worsened after years of relative control, and there are concrete next steps that can help.\n\nWhat could be driving the change\n- Seizure type and diagnosis\n  - Many adults with “absence-like” spells actually have focal temporal seizures. Getting the exact diagnosis right matters because it guides treatment.\n  - Some people with epilepsy also have psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES); stress can trigger these. PNES can co‑exist with true epileptic seizures, so teasing them apart is essential.\n- Medication-related issues\n  - Missed doses, time‑zone changes, switching manufacturers (different generics between countries), or drug interactions can reduce control.\n  - Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) commonly causes low sodium (hyponatremia), especially in women and when combined with certain blood‑pressure meds (thiazide diuretics) or SSRIs. Low sodium can cause confusion and trigger more seizures.\n  - Current doses: levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily (can go higher if tolerated), oxcarbazepine 750 mg twice daily (monitor sodium carefully if considering increases).\n- New medical contributors\n  - Sleep deprivation/jet lag, anxiety, depression.\n  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and can make seizures harder to control; snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness are clues.\n  - Metabolic/infectious issues (UTI, thyroid problems, glucose swings, vitamin deficiencies).\n  - Structural causes: if brain imaging/EEG hasn’t been updated, new or previously missed lesions can be relevant. Given recent travel, neurocysticercosis is a consideration in the right clinical context.\n  - Perimenopausal hormonal fluctuations can exacerbate seizures.\n\nWhat to do next (prioritized)\n1) See an epilepsy specialist (epileptologist) at a comprehensive epilepsy center\n   - Ask for inpatient video‑EEG monitoring to capture typical events. This is the gold standard to confirm whether events are epileptic, PNES, or both, and from where seizures start.\n   - If no recent imaging, request an epilepsy‑protocol 3T brain MRI. Depending on history/travel, the team may consider additional tests (e.g., for neurocysticercosis if appropriate).\n2) Get labs soon (can start with GP)\n   - Serum sodium and comprehensive metabolic panel (urgent given oxcarbazepine).\n   - CBC, kidney/liver function, TSH, B12/folate, fasting glucose/HbA1c, vitamin D.\n   - Urinalysis if urinary symptoms or confusion.\n   - Consider oxcarbazepine active metabolite level; levetiracetam levels are less commonly used but can help with adherence questions.\n3) Full medication review\n   - Bring all prescription/OTC/herbal meds. Flag any new medicines from India.\n   - Specifically check for: thiazide diuretics (can worsen low sodium), SSRIs/SNRIs (can lower sodium), tramadol, bupropion, antihistamines like diphenhydramine, and other agents that lower seizure threshold.\n   - Standardize to one manufacturer for each antiseizure med; use a pillbox and alarms to protect adherence.\n4) Optimize antiseizure therapy based on findings\n   - If events are epileptic focal seizures: options include dose adjustments or trying alternatives/adjuncts such as lamotrigine, lacosamide, clobazam, brivaracetam (often better tolerated for mood than levetiracetam), etc.\n   - If two appropriate medications at adequate doses have not controlled seizures, she meets criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy; referral for evaluation of device or surgical therapies (VNS, RNS, DBS, or resective surgery if a focus is found) is appropriate.\n   - Ask about a rescue plan for clusters/prolonged events (e.g., nasal midazolam or diazepam).\n5) If PNES is identified (alone or co‑existing)\n   - Treatment is psychological therapy (CBT with a clinician experienced in PNES), stress management, and addressing mood/anxiety. Antiseizure meds don’t treat PNES and may be reduced if appropriate once epileptic events are excluded.\n6) Address sleep and mental health\n   - Screen for OSA; a sleep study and CPAP can substantially reduce seizure frequency in those affected.\n   - Continue with a psychologist; consider a psychiatrist if mood/anxiety is significant (with attention to drug interactions and sodium).\n   - Regular sleep/wake schedule, daily physical activity, mindfulness/stress‑reduction.\n7) Safety and quality‑of‑life steps now\n   - Driving: follow local laws and doctor advice; typically no driving until seizures are controlled.\n   - Bathing: showers only, door unlocked, someone nearby; avoid swimming alone.\n   - Kitchen: use microwave/electric appliances instead of open flames, avoid carrying hot liquids, use cut‑resistant gloves if chopping triggers risk.\n   - Home: soften sharp furniture edges, non‑slip mats, avoid heights/ladders, consider a helmet if falls occur, keep floors clear.\n   - Nighttime: consider seizure detection wearables/alarms (e.g., Embrace, NightWatch) if events occur unobserved.\n   - Medical ID bracelet and a written seizure action plan for family/coworkers, including first‑aid steps and when to call emergency services.\n   - Keep a seizure diary (time, trigger, features, recovery, missed meds, stress/sleep).\n\nSupport and resources (Australia)\n- Epilepsy Action Australia and Epilepsy Foundation: education, safety planning, carer support, community links.\n- Comprehensive Epilepsy Centers (major tertiary hospitals) for epileptologist and video‑EEG.\n- Consider an occupational therapist for home safety assessment; a dietitian if exploring modified Atkins/ketogenic approaches.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Any seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, new severe headache/fever/neck stiffness, head injury, or marked confusion or drowsiness that’s new. If she seems much more confused than usual, get a same‑day sodium check.\n\nA few questions that would help tailor next steps\n- Any new or changed medicines in the past 6–12 months (including BP, cholesterol, antidepressants, sleep aids, pain meds, OTC, or herbal remedies)?\n- Any lab results showing low sodium in the past?\n- Does she snore, stop breathing at night, or feel unrefreshed on waking?\n- When was her last EEG and brain MRI?\n- Are these events clustering around menstrual cycles?\n\nIf you can, start with a GP visit this week for labs and med review, and request expedited referral to an epileptologist for video‑EEG. That combination—confirming the event type, checking sodium and interactions, and optimizing therapy—offers the best chance of regaining control and improving her quality of life.",

    "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I’d still want more. I’ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can’t pinpoint any specific triggers.I’m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I’ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing. Could that be something that is going on? I was just curious! This doesn’t really negatively impact my life, it just causes me to get some weird looks sometimes.Details: 23F, 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs, Caucasian, acid cravings, existing medical issues (Migraines, IST, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation), medications (verapamil and singulair), no drugs, sparingly drink, no smoking.",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—cravings like yours can sometimes be a clue. The pattern you describe (intense urges for vinegar, lemons, tomatoes, pickled/acidic foods) is classically reported in some people with iron deficiency–related pica, even before anemia shows up. There’s also a specific form called tomatophagia (craving/eating lots of tomatoes) linked to iron deficiency. It’s not diagnostic by itself, but it’s common enough that it’s worth checking.\n\nWhat to consider checking\n- Iron studies: ferritin (most important), serum iron, transferrin/TIBC, transferrin saturation\n- CBC with differential (you mentioned low WBC; iron deficiency can exist even with a normal hemoglobin early on)\n- If iron is low, think about causes: heavy periods, low iron intake, recent blood donation, GI blood loss, celiac disease, H. pylori\n\nOther possibilities\n- Pregnancy or cyclic hormonal shifts (sour cravings are common)—take a pregnancy test if there’s any chance.\n- Zinc deficiency can alter taste and drive strong flavor cravings (less common).\n- After drinking alcohol, sour/salty cravings can increase transiently due to dehydration and taste shifts.\n\nSafety tips if you keep indulging\n- Avoid drinking vinegar straight. Use it on foods or dilute (e.g., 1–2 tablespoons in a large glass of water) and limit how often.\n- Rinse your mouth with water after acidic foods; wait 30 minutes before brushing to protect enamel.\n- Watch for reflux, throat irritation, stomach pain. Very high chronic intake has, in rare cases, caused low potassium and bone issues.\n- See a dentist if you notice sensitivity or enamel wear.\n\nMedications/conditions\n- No known meaningful interaction between vinegar and verapamil or montelukast.\n- Your low WBC isn’t typically related to sour/vinegar cravings; if it’s persistent or you get frequent infections, discuss with your clinician.\n\nWhen to see your clinician\n- Ask for iron studies (including ferritin) even if your hemoglobin has been normal.\n- Go sooner if you have fatigue, shortness of breath, paleness, hair loss, brittle nails, restless legs, heavy periods, pica for non-food items, or black/tarry stools.\n\nIf iron is low, correcting it (dietary iron and/or iron supplements, and addressing the cause) often makes these specific cravings fade within weeks.",

An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn’t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn’t feel normal, I’ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don’t feel quite normal at the moment and I’m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it’s my first ever post on Reddit and I’m just very confused about what’s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing all of that — I know it’s scary and confusing. What you describe could be due to several things, but it’s important not to ignore it. Some of your symptoms sound like they could be focal seizures (for example, sudden intense fear/panic, feeling “detached,” staring, not feeling right for a while afterward). They could also be panic attacks, or (given the nose piercing/heat) episodes of fainting that can sometimes include brief jerks. Cannabis can trigger panic and, in some people, may lower the seizure threshold. From what you’ve written, it’s not possible to tell which it is — you need a proper assessment.\n\nWhat to do now\n- If you have another episode, or if you develop a severe headache, weakness on one side, trouble speaking, repeated vomiting, or the episode lasts more than 5 minutes, call 999.\n- Otherwise, tonight: rest, hydrate, avoid alcohol/cannabis, try not to be alone, and avoid baths, heights, cooking over open flame, or anything risky until you’ve been seen.\n\nGet medical help soon\n- In the UK, you should arrange an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 for advice tonight. Ask for an urgent “first seizure/suspected seizure” referral to neurology. NICE guidance aims for assessment within 2 weeks.\n- Likely tests: blood tests, an EEG (brain-wave test), and a brain MRI. These help distinguish epilepsy from other causes like panic, fainting, or non‑epileptic (dissociative) events.\n\nDriving and safety\n- If you think you may have had a seizure, stop driving for now. Your GP/neurologist will advise about DVLA rules and whether you need to notify them.\n- Until you’re assessed: no swimming alone, no baths (use showers), avoid heights, heavy machinery, and sleeping on top bunks.\n\nIf it happens again, things to note (or have someone observe/video safely)\n- Sudden vs gradual onset; how long it lasts.\n- Whether you can respond/talk or if speech stops.\n- Staring, lip-smacking/other repetitive movements, head turning.\n- Tongue biting (especially on the side), incontinence.\n- Skin color change (very pale vs flushed), sweating, nausea beforehand.\n- How long until you feel back to normal.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Focal seizures (especially from the temporal lobe) can present exactly as sudden fear, déjà vu/jamais vu, odd smells/tastes, or a “detached” feeling, sometimes with staring and inability to respond, and a tired/“off” period afterward.\n- Panic attacks can feel similar but often build over minutes, feature hyperventilation, and you can usually recall the whole event; they often last longer without a sharp “switch on/off.”\n- Fainting (vasovagal) from pain/needles/heat can cause brief jerks; people are often sweaty, pale, nauseous, and recover quickly once lying down.\n- Non‑epileptic (dissociative) seizures can also happen, especially with stress/anxiety, and need specialist assessment and treatment too.\n\nMental health\n- Your anxiety and depression can cause panic/dissociation-like episodes. Cannabis can worsen anxiety and carries a higher risk of psychosis, particularly in young people. It’s a good idea to avoid it completely.\n- If you’re having intrusive worries about schizophrenia, bring this up with your GP as well — they can screen and support you.\n\nSeizure first aid for others around you\n- Protect your head, move hazards, time the event.\n- Don’t restrain, don’t put anything in your mouth.\n- Roll onto your side once movements stop or if vomiting.\n- Call 999 if it lasts >5 minutes, repeats without recovery, there’s an injury, breathing problems, it happens in water, or if it’s a first-ever convulsive seizure.\n\nPlease set up a GP appointment as soon as you can or call NHS 111 for same-day advice. If you’d like, I can help you think through what to say to your GP and what to ask for.",

    "question": "Age 33 Sex M Height 5’ 9” Weight 170 Race Caucasian Duration of complaint 3 Weeks Location Distal Tibia/Ankle Any existing relevant medical issues Epilepsy Current medications KeppraI’m about 3 weeks post skateboarding injury and I have this lump on my distal tibia. Seems like it’s off the bone on the medial side. As a skateboarder it’s common to take repetitive shots to the ankle, so I’m not overly concerned. The lump happened to appear after the injury. It wasn’t super painful so I kept on skating after a few more incidents to the same area I decided to take a break. I’m about a week removed from skating and haven’t seen a noticeable improvement. No pain. Just sensitive to the touch. Thanks in advance",
    "answer": "Likely causes (based on your description)\n- Most likely: a post‑traumatic soft‑tissue hematoma/contusion or seroma sitting over the distal tibia (can feel “off the bone,” tender to touch, and can persist for weeks).\n- Other possibilities: periosteal (bone) bruise with a small reactive lump, or a tendon-sheath/ganglion cyst triggered by trauma.\n- Less likely but worth ruling out if symptoms change: stress fracture of the distal tibia/medial malleolus, or a calcifying hematoma (myositis ossificans).\n\nWhat to do now\n- Rest and protect: Give it another 1–2 weeks off from skating and avoid direct knocks to the area.\n- Compression and elevation: Wear a snug elastic wrap/compression sleeve during the day; elevate after activity.\n- Warmth now (not ice): Warm compresses 10–15 minutes, 2–3 times/day can help a lingering hematoma resorb. Avoid aggressive deep massage.\n- Pain control: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen/naproxen as needed. These are generally fine with Keppra; avoid tramadol (can lower seizure threshold).\n- Gentle mobility/strength: \n  - Ankle range of motion (ankle “ABCs,” circles) 1–2x/day.\n  - Calf raises (both legs progressing to single‑leg), 2–3 sets of 10–15.\n  - Light band work in all directions and single‑leg balance.\n\nWhen to get checked\n- If it’s not clearly shrinking by 4–6 weeks from injury, or it’s getting bigger, red, warm, very firm, or starts to hurt more.\n- If you develop numbness/tingling, increasing calf/leg swelling, trouble bearing weight, or pain with hopping on that leg.\n- A clinician can do an ultrasound (best to distinguish hematoma/seroma/cyst) and an X‑ray if there’s concern for a stress fracture or periosteal reaction.\n\nReturn‑to‑skating checklist\n- No tenderness with firm pressure over the lump.\n- Pain‑free single‑leg hop and 20 single‑leg heel raises.\n- First sessions should be short and low‑impact; use padding/shin guard over the spot and a compression sleeve to reduce recurrent trauma.\n\nQuick questions that help narrow it down\n- About how big is the lump, and is it soft/fluctuant or firm/hard?\n- Any redness or warmth over it, or color changes in the foot?\n- Does it move with the skin or feel fixed to the bone?\n- Any pain with hopping or jogging?\n\nIf you can share a clear photo from a couple angles, that would help refine advice.",

    "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female",
    "answer": "I’m sorry she’s going through this. The pattern you describe could be from seizures, fainting (syncope), both, or another condition. Multiple MRIs and a brief steroid trial don’t establish MS, and MS typically does not cause sudden loss of consciousness. The key now is to clearly identify what these events are.\n\nWhat these episodes could be\n- Epileptic seizures (including focal impaired-awareness “autopilot” spells; catamenial epilepsy where seizures worsen around menses)\n- Syncope: vasovagal, orthostatic intolerance/POTS (common in young women, often worse around periods), or a heart rhythm problem; syncope can include brief convulsive movements\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)\n- Less common: hypoglycemia, anemia, medication/substance effects, sleep disorders\n\nImmediate safety\n- No driving, swimming alone, heights, or baths; use showers, door unlocked, someone nearby.\n- Avoid operating machinery, ladders, or working at unprotected heights.\n- If a spell lasts >5 minutes, repeats without full recovery, results in injury, or occurs with chest pain/palpitations, go to the ER.\n\nWhat to do next (parallel tracks)\n1) Epilepsy evaluation\n- Ask for referral to a Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (epileptologist). If possible, arrange inpatient video-EEG monitoring to capture a typical event. This is the single best test to distinguish epileptic seizures from PNES and convulsive syncope.\n- If inpatient is not available soon: prolonged ambulatory EEG and an MRI with an “epilepsy protocol.”\n- Bring a witness who can describe events; try to get a phone video of an episode.\n\n2) Cardiac/autonomic evaluation (because fainting is still on the table)\n- 12‑lead ECG and orthostatic vitals.\n- Ambulatory heart monitor (2–4 weeks; longer if spells are infrequent).\n- Consider tilt-table test for vasovagal syncope/POTS; autonomic clinic if available.\n- Echocardiogram if any abnormal ECG, new murmur, or red flags (fainting with exertion or while lying down, family history of sudden death).\n\n3) Basic labs and contributors\n- CBC and ferritin (iron deficiency is common with heavy periods and can worsen fainting), CMP, fasting glucose or A1c, TSH, pregnancy test if applicable.\n- Review all medications/supplements, caffeine, alcohol, and recreational drugs.\n\nIf seizures are confirmed\n- Track cycle and events: date, time, triggers, details, recovery. This helps identify catamenial pattern.\n- Discuss with the epileptologist:\n  - Optimizing medication (common options: levetiracetam, lamotrigine, lacosamide; avoid valproate if possible in women of childbearing age).\n  - Catamenial strategies if events cluster around menses: short perimenstrual add-on (e.g., clobazam), temporary dose adjustments, or progesterone-based therapy; avoid high‑estrogen contraceptives (estrogen can worsen seizures and lower lamotrigine levels).\n  - Rescue med for prolonged seizures (intranasal midazolam or diazepam).\n- Consider folic acid 1 mg daily if on antiseizure meds and of childbearing potential.\n\nIf syncope/orthostatic intolerance is confirmed\n- Non‑drug measures: 2–3 L fluids/day, higher salt intake if safe (e.g., 8–12 g/day per clinician guidance), compression stockings, avoid heat/prolonged standing, physical counter‑maneuvers, graded exercise (recumbent bike/rowing).\n- Medications if needed (cardiology-guided): fludrocortisone, midodrine, beta‑blocker or ivabradine, etc.\n- Treat anemia or heavy menstrual bleeding if present (gynecology input).\n\nIf PNES is diagnosed\n- Clear, compassionate explanation plus referral for psychotherapy (CBT or trauma‑informed therapy). Antiseizure drugs don’t treat PNES.\n\nMS\n- Based on what you’ve shared, MS is unlikely to explain these brief losses of consciousness. If there are persistent neurological deficits (vision loss, numbness/weakness lasting days), see an MS specialist, but don’t let this distract from clarifying the spells.\n\nPlease answer a few questions to narrow this:\n- Before an event: does she feel lightheaded, hot, sweaty, nauseated, or have tunnel vision? Or does it occur without warning?\n- Triggers: prolonged standing, heat, pain, dehydration, exertion, or emotion? Any relation to sleep deprivation or alcohol?\n- During: eyes open or closed? Color change (pale/blue)? Stiffening first or collapse first? Rhythmic jerks? Tongue biting (tip vs side)? Urinary incontinence?\n- How long unconscious? How long confused after?\n- The “autopilot” spells: how long, any odd smell/taste, rising stomach feeling, déjà vu, or fear beforehand?\n- Any palpitations or chest pain?\n- Menstrual pattern: do events cluster in the few days before or during menses? Are periods heavy?\n- Which medicines has she tried, at what doses, and what happened?\n- Any family history of seizures, fainting, heart rhythm problems, or sudden death?\n\nIf you can share those details, I can help you refine the next steps and what to ask her doctors. In the meantime, try to get referrals to both an epileptologist (preferably at a Level 3/4 epilepsy center) and a cardiologist/electrophysiologist or autonomic clinic, and start a detailed event and menstrual diary.",

    "question": "25F white JME keppra 1gMy epilepsy seems very well controlled with keppra. No complaints.Lately I've been feeling really tired, but I'm getting good sleep. I don't have any signs of seizures when I wake up. It's always been hard to wake up in the mornings, but lately it's been awful. It feels like I didn't sleep at all.I was working today. I closed my eyes to blink, and everything was kinda dizzy, but it went away quick. It's hard to describe, it's kinda like dizziness, but also like everything's... dropping? Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",
    "answer": "Short answer: levetiracetam (Keppra) doesn’t usually “wear off” with time. True tolerance is uncommon. But levels can dip or seizures can re‑emerge if something in your life or body has changed, or if the dose/timing isn’t ideal for you.\n\nWhat your symptoms could be\n- Brief “blip” spells with eye closure: In JME, very brief lapses or myoclonic phenomena can be triggered by eye closure or bright/flickering light. People describe them as a quick “drop/melt” or momentary dizziness without a visible jerk. These may be subtle absence/myoclonic events.\n- Triggers: sleep schedule changes, stress, illness, alcohol, menstruation, more screen time/bright light, or missed/late doses can bring back brief events even when on Keppra.\n- Medication factors: taking immediate‑release Keppra once daily can leave you with low trough levels; most adults take it twice daily (or XR once daily). Weight change, pregnancy, kidney function changes, or a switch in generic manufacturer can alter levels. Other meds (e.g., bupropion, tramadol, some antihistamines) can lower seizure threshold.\n- Non‑seizure causes of fatigue: anemia, thyroid issues, low iron/B12, depression, sleep disorders (sleep apnea, hypersomnia), or sedating meds can add to morning “wrecked” feeling.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Call your neurologist soon (this week if possible). Ask about:\n  - Whether your current dose and schedule are right for you (e.g., 500 mg twice daily, 1000 mg twice daily, or XR once daily). Clarify exactly how you take it now.\n  - Checking a levetiracetam level and basic labs (CBC, ferritin/iron, TSH, B12, CMP). If there’s any chance of pregnancy, do a test—pregnancy can lower Keppra levels and needs closer monitoring.\n  - An EEG with eye‑closure and photic stimulation, or ambulatory EEG, to capture these brief spells.\n- Keep a brief diary for the next 1–2 weeks:\n  - Time of day, what you were doing, lighting/screen exposure, duration and description of the “melt/dizzy” spells, any missed/late doses, sleep duration, alcohol/caffeine, cycle day.\n- Safety:\n  - If you’re having brief lapses of awareness, avoid driving and high‑risk activities until you’ve been evaluated.\n  - Minimize flicker exposure: reduce screen brightness, use blue‑light filter/night mode, avoid bright strobing lights and sun‑through‑trees while driving, consider polarized/blue‑blocking sunglasses outside.\n- Lifestyle tune‑ups that help JME:\n  - Keep sleep and wake times consistent; avoid sleep deprivation.\n  - No binge drinking; hydrate and don’t skip meals.\n  - Manage stress; take breaks from screens.\n\nAbout the fatigue\n- Keppra can cause fatigue, but a new/worse fatigue after years on a stable dose warrants checking other causes and your dosing schedule. Some people feel better on XR once daily or split dosing at different times—discuss with your neurologist.\n- If mood/irritability is an issue, mention it. Some clinicians try vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50–100 mg/day for Keppra‑related mood/fatigue, but do this only after discussing with your provider.\n\nRed flags that should prompt urgent care\n- A generalized convulsive seizure, clusters of spells, confusion that lasts minutes, any injury or falls, or spells increasing rapidly in frequency.\n- New neurological symptoms (weakness, trouble speaking, severe persistent vertigo), severe headache, or if pregnant with worsening seizures.\n\nA few quick questions to help narrow this down:\n1) Exactly how are you taking Keppra now (dose, immediate‑release vs XR, times of day, any missed/late doses recently)?\n2) Any recent illness, weight change, new meds or supplements, alcohol changes, more screen/bright light exposure, or pharmacy/manufacturer switch?\n3) Could you be pregnant?\n4) Do the “melt” spells happen more in the morning, with bright light, or right as you close your eyes?\n5) Any history of absence spells before, and are you still having any myoclonic jerks on awakening?",

    "answer": "I’m really sorry she’s going through this. The combination of fainting, a single convulsive event, “autopilot” spells, and a possible menstrual pattern is complex—but there is a clear path to sort it out. The key is to capture a typical event on the right tests, and to consider both neurologic and cardiac/autonomic causes.\n\nWhat could be going on\n- Epileptic seizures, possibly catamenial (hormone-related) epilepsy: seizures can cluster around ovulation or just before periods due to progesterone/estrogen changes. Brief “autopilot” spells can be focal impaired-awareness seizures.\n- Convulsive syncope (fainting with brief jerks): common and often misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Triggers include standing, heat, dehydration, pain, stress; usually a brief loss of consciousness with quick recovery.\n- Autonomic/cardiac causes: vasovagal syncope, POTS, arrhythmias. These often worsen around menses and can cause frequent fainting.\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic events (PNES): can mimic seizures; requires video-EEG to diagnose. Note that someone can have both epileptic and nonepileptic events.\n- MS is unlikely to explain recurrent loss of consciousness. If MRI suggested MS, that should be clarified separately with an MS specialist, but it doesn’t account for fainting spells.\n\nMost useful next steps (prioritized)\n1) Epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission at a comprehensive epilepsy center\n- Goal: capture her typical events with continuous video-EEG to determine if they are epileptic, nonepileptic, syncope-related, or mixed.\n- Ask for an admission timed to when she most often has events (e.g., just before her period).\n- If not feasible, consider an ambulatory EEG with video for several days at home.\n\n2) Cardiac and autonomic evaluation in parallel\n- 12‑lead ECG; orthostatic vitals (lying/sitting/standing BP and heart rate); labs (CBC/ferritin, electrolytes, glucose/A1C, TSH).\n- 14–30 day patch/event monitor to look for arrhythmias. If events are frequent but not captured, consider a longer-term loop recorder.\n- Tilt-table test if POTS/vasovagal syncope is suspected.\n\n3) Menstrual–event diary for 2–3 cycles\n- Track day-by-day: menses, ovulation if known, sleep, stress, hydration, medications, and every spell (time, what happened, duration, recovery).\n- This can reveal catamenial patterns and guide treatment.\n\n4) Medication review with a neurologist experienced in women’s epilepsy\n- List every antiseizure med tried, doses, side effects, and whether events improved or worsened.\n- If she uses estrogen-containing birth control, know it can lower lamotrigine levels and sometimes affect seizure control.\n- For suspected catamenial seizures, options to discuss: perimenstrual dose adjustments of her current antiseizure med, short “pulse” therapy around high‑risk days (e.g., clobazam or acetazolamide), or cyclic natural progesterone. Do not start these without her neurologist.\n\n5) Clarify the MS question separately\n- MS typically does not cause fainting or brief impaired-awareness spells.\n- If MRI was “suggestive,” ask for review by an MS specialist; consider CSF oligoclonal bands and repeat MRI with MS protocol if clinically indicated.\n\nSafety now\n- No driving until cleared.\n- Shower instead of bath; don’t swim alone; avoid heights, open flames, or operating heavy machinery.\n- Use a soft headboard/padding at home if falls are frequent; sit or lie down at the first warning.\n- Teach family/friends seizure first aid: turn her on her side, don’t put anything in the mouth, time the event, call emergency services if a convulsive seizure lasts >5 minutes, repeats without recovery, or if she has a serious head injury.\n\nSigns that point one way or another (helpful details to observe)\n- Syncope more likely: triggers like prolonged standing/heat/pain; warning of lightheadedness, tunnel vision, nausea, sweating; pale color; brief LOC (<20–30 sec); quick recovery with minimal confusion. Jerks can happen after the faint starts.\n- Epilepsy more likely: sudden onset without typical faint prodrome; tongue bite on the side; blue/purplish color; prolonged post-event confusion or muscle soreness; repeated stereotyped “autopilot” behaviors (lip smacking, picking, staring) lasting 30–120 sec.\n- Catamenial pattern: clear clustering just before period or mid-cycle.\n- PNES: variable, prolonged events with eyes closed, side-to-side head movements, preserved awareness of surroundings; but diagnosis requires video-EEG.\n\nPlease share more details if you can\n- Exact description of a typical event from a witness: what she was doing, position (standing/sitting/lying), any warning symptoms, color change, eye position, movements, sounds, duration, tongue biting (tip vs side), incontinence, injuries, and how long confusion lasts.\n- How often and when relative to the menstrual cycle; any mid-cycle vs premenstrual clustering.\n- Current and past meds with doses; any hormonal contraception; any changes in meds around the time these started.\n- Any palpitations, chest pain, or very fast/slow heart rates on a wearable during events.\n- Results of prior EEGs (routine, sleep-deprived, ambulatory?), MRIs (what did the reports actually say?), and any labs.\n- Family history of seizures, fainting, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death.\n\nIf you’re in the U.S., ask her primary care or neurologist for referral to a Level 3 or 4 epilepsy center (Epilepsy Foundation/NAEC “Find an Epilepsy Center”). If elsewhere, ask for an “epilepsy monitoring unit” or “video-EEG monitoring” referral and a cardiology/autonomic clinic for syncope/POTS workup.\n\nYou’re not alone in this—people with similar stories often turn out to have one of: catamenial epilepsy, vasovagal syncope/POTS, convulsive syncope, or a mix. Capturing an event on video‑EEG and getting a basic cardiac/autonomic workup usually makes the path forward much clearer.",

    "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. I can’t diagnose you, but I can help frame what your team is considering and what questions to ask.\n\nWhat your episode sounds like\n- The “electric shock” in one hand followed by loss of consciousness, witnessed convulsions, and not breathing is very consistent with a focal seizure that spread to a generalized tonic–clonic seizure. \n- The nightly, brief, stereotyped “pit of the stomach” feeling is a classic temporal lobe seizure aura (an epigastric rising sensation). Anxiety or reflux can feel similar, but when the sensation is brief, stereotyped, and recurring, seizures are more likely.\n\nCould this be vascular instead of seizures?\n- Vascular problems can trigger seizures, especially when the cortex is irritated by ischemia or bleeding.\n- Carotid artery dissection can cause strokes/TIAs and can also present with seizures, though that’s less common. Typical TIA symptoms are negative deficits (weakness, numbness, vision/language loss), not loss of consciousness or whole‑body convulsions. “Limb-shaking TIAs” exist but usually don’t cause complete loss of consciousness or post‑event confusion.\n- If your 8 mm lesion is a vascular malformation (e.g., cavernous malformation/AVM/DVA) near cortex, that can be a chronic seizure focus. The angiogram should help clarify what the lesion is and whether a dissection is present.\n\nDid you develop epilepsy at 35?\n- Epilepsy is generally diagnosed after 2 unprovoked seizures, or after 1 unprovoked seizure if there’s a high risk of recurrence due to an enduring brain lesion.\n- If your initial event was “acute symptomatic” (directly due to an acute dissection/stroke within about 7 days), that alone doesn’t confirm chronic epilepsy. However, your recurrent nightly auras suggest ongoing focal seizures, which would support a diagnosis of epilepsy unless another cause is proven.\n\nDo you need to stay on seizure meds forever?\n- Not necessarily. Many people taper after about 2 years seizure‑free with a reassuring EEG and no high‑risk brain lesion.\n- If a structural lesion remains that raises recurrence risk, longer‑term treatment is more likely.\n- Because you’re having nightly possible auras, this is not the time to taper. Capturing an event on EEG (ambulatory or inpatient video‑EEG) would help confirm they are seizures and guide therapy.\n\nAbout your current medications\n- Keppra causing rage is common; switching made sense.\n- Lacosamide (Vimpat) can cause brain fog/dizziness. If side effects are significant, ask about alternatives that are often well‑tolerated:\n  - Lamotrigine (good mood profile, weight‑neutral; slow titration)\n  - Brivaracetam (similar to Keppra with fewer behavioral effects)\n  - Oxcarbazepine (effective; monitor sodium)\n  - Zonisamide or topiramate (can aid weight loss but more cognitive side effects)\n- Sometimes adjusting dose timing (more at night), slow uptitration, or combination therapy at lower doses reduces side effects.\n\nKey tests and next steps to discuss with your team\n- Diagnostic cerebral angiogram: best test to confirm carotid dissection and characterize vascular lesions. Small stroke risk exists but is low; your team will review this.\n- EEG: If not already done or if it was normal, consider prolonged ambulatory EEG or inpatient video‑EEG to capture the nightly episodes.\n- Clarify the MRI lesion: Is it a cavernous malformation, DVA, AVM, capillary telangiectasia, or small prior hemorrhage? Location relative to cortex matters for seizure risk and whether surgery is ever considered.\n- If carotid dissection is confirmed: discuss antithrombotic therapy (usually antiplatelet; sometimes anticoagulation) and duration.\n- Driving/safety: Most regions require a seizure‑free interval (often 6–12 months). Ask your neurologist about your state’s rules. Take seizure precautions (no heights/swimming alone, avoid bathing alone, use back burners, etc.).\n- Risk‑factor control: With obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, optimize BP, glucose, lipids, and consider sleep apnea screening—OSA can worsen seizures and vascular risk.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Any seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, a new focal deficit (weakness, speech or vision loss), a severe new headache/neck pain (especially with dissection), or after your angiogram if you have sudden neurologic changes.\n\nBottom line\n- Your initial event and nightly sensations strongly suggest focal seizures; a vascular problem may have triggered them or could be the ongoing source.\n- TIAs alone rarely cause convulsive loss of consciousness, but dissection‑related cortical ischemia can provoke seizures.\n- Whether this is chronic epilepsy depends on whether seizures continue once the acute vascular issue is addressed. Right now, with recurring nightly episodes, staying on antiseizure medication is appropriate; you don’t necessarily need it forever.\n- Ask about prolonged EEG, the exact nature of the MRI lesion, and medication options better tolerated for you.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft concise questions for your appointment tomorrow or review your report language (without personal identifiers) to interpret terms.",

    "question": "Why does my head feel like it’s slightly shaking when I put my hands on my forehead and press them down into my pillow ? I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5’9 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I’m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don’t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it’s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don’t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it’s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I’m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it’s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it’s the fasciculation of muscle from stress. They booked me in with a neurologist but it might take 3 week. What’s wrong with me ?",
    "answer": "Short answer: what you’re describing most often turns out to be benign muscle activity (fasciculations) and/or a mild tremor, which stress, poor sleep, caffeine, and some medicines (including valproate/Epilim) can make more noticeable. Pressing your forehead into a pillow tenses small neck/forehead muscles and lets you feel tiny movements and even your heartbeat transmitted through the pillow, which can feel like “shaking.” This does not sound like an epileptic seizure.\n\nWhy this is likely benign\n- Fasciculations: brief, small twitches you can see under the skin, usually not felt as a strong jerk and do not cause loss of awareness or move the limb. Common with stress, fatigue, exercise, caffeine, dehydration, and anxiety. Often come and go for weeks to months and then settle.\n- Tremor from valproate (Epilim): a common side effect, usually a fine postural/action tremor of hands or head; can be dose-related. You may notice it more when muscles are engaged (like pressing your head into a pillow).\n- Hypnic jerks or brief “body shakes” at night are common and benign.\n- Absence seizures typically cause brief staring/awareness lapses, not focal limb twitching.\n\nThings that make this less concerning:\n- You’re alert with no loss of awareness.\n- Twitches are small, intermittent, and in a few spots.\n- No progressive weakness, numbness, slurred speech, or coordination problems.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care (now or same day)\n- New seizure or any event with loss of awareness; a convulsion lasting 5 minutes or more; repeated seizures without recovery.\n- New or rapidly worsening weakness, trouble speaking, walking, vision changes, severe headache, fever/stiff neck, confusion, or severe vomiting.\n- Severe muscle pain with dark urine.\n\nWhat you can do while waiting for neurology (3 weeks)\n- Don’t change your Epilim dose on your own. Ask your GP about:\n  - Checking a valproate level (trough), liver tests, platelets, and ammonia if you ever feel unusually drowsy/confused.\n  - Basic labs that can worsen twitching: electrolytes (Na/K), calcium, magnesium, thyroid (TSH), B12, vitamin D, ferritin.\n  - Whether your symptoms could be a valproate-related tremor and if dose adjustment is appropriate.\n- Cut common triggers: caffeine/energy drinks, decongestants, nicotine (you don’t smoke), excessive pre-workout supplements.\n- Prioritize sleep, hydration, and regular meals. Gentle daily activity helps.\n- Consider magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg at night if your GP agrees (generally safe with valproate; avoid if kidney disease).\n- Record short videos of the twitching and the “head shaking” sensation to show the neurologist. Note:\n  - Time of day, triggers, caffeine/sleep, and whether it stops with full relaxation.\n- Try a simple check: relax your neck and stop pressing your head into the pillow—if the sensation goes away, it’s likely mechanical/pulse/mild tremor rather than a neurological emergency.\n\nWhy you feel “head shaking” with pressure on the pillow\n- Pressing your head engages small neck/scalp muscles that can have a fine tremor.\n- The pillow transmits and amplifies tiny vibrations, including your heartbeat, making them feel like shaking.\n\nIf anything changes (new neurological symptoms, true weakness, confusion, or a definite new seizure), seek urgent medical attention or call NHS 111 for advice.\n\nIf you can, please share:\n- Your exact Epilim dose (mg per tablet and total per day) and any recent dose changes.\n- Sleep, caffeine/energy drink intake, and whether the twitches worsen with anxiety or exercise.\n- Any other meds or supplements.",

    "question": "About a month ago i smoked a little weed with my friends at a pool and when i got out i started feeling extremely light headed so i went to go sit down on a lounge chair next thing i knew i was on the ground everything was completely black and i couldn't see or hear anything all i could feel was my body flopping around uncontrollably and i couldn't stop it. The whole experience only lasted about 15 seconds but it felt like 15 minutes then out of nowhere i was able to stand up and my vision cleared and i was fine if anyone has any experience with or knows why this happened please help me im scared there could be underlying health issues i never knew about (i smoke fairly frequently and it never happened prior to this incident or after any help would be greatly appreciated)Edit: mods removed my first post for not adding this so age and gender 16m weight 132lbs height 6'3 no medical issues aside from psychological and im on no medications",
    "answer": "Short answer: This sounds most like a brief faint (vasovagal/orthostatic syncope) with a few “convulsive” jerks, triggered by heat, getting out of warm water, likely dehydration, and cannabis. That combination can drop your blood pressure fast, your vision/hearing can go black, you pass out for a few seconds, have some brief uncontrolled movements, then recover quickly without confusion. Still, because you lost consciousness and had shaking, you should be checked by a clinician to make sure it wasn’t a seizure or a heart rhythm issue.\n\nWhy this likely happened:\n- Common trigger stack: warm pool/hot weather + standing up + probable dehydration + cannabis (which can cause vasodilation and lower blood pressure) = sudden drop in brain blood flow.\n- Convulsive syncope is common: during a faint, brief jerks or “flopping” can happen. People typically recover within seconds and feel more or less normal soon after.\n- Your profile (16 years old, very tall and underweight) makes orthostatic intolerance more likely.\n\nSigns pointing more to a faint than a seizure:\n- Clear trigger (standing after warm water; cannabis)\n- “Blackout” with hearing/vision fading, very brief episode (~15 seconds)\n- Rapid full recovery without prolonged confusion\n\nRed flags that would need urgent care if they occur now or in the future:\n- Fainting during exercise or in the water, no warning\n- Chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath before the event\n- Confusion lasting >10–15 minutes after\n- Tongue biting on the sides, significant injury, or urinary incontinence\n- Family history of sudden cardiac death or arrhythmias before age 50\n- Recurrent episodes\n\nWhat to do next:\n- Make a routine appointment with your primary care clinician soon. Tell a parent/guardian. Ask for:\n  - Orthostatic vitals (lying/sitting/standing blood pressure and heart rate)\n  - ECG\n  - Basic labs: CBC (anemia), electrolytes, glucose; consider iron studies if you’re often tired or look pale\n  - Further testing (echo, monitor, or neuro eval) only if exam/ECG/history suggests it\n- Until you’re seen:\n  - Avoid cannabis and any substance use, especially around water or heat.\n  - Hydrate well; add some salt with meals if you don’t have high blood pressure.\n  - Don’t skip meals; your BMI suggests you’re underweight—adequate nutrition helps prevent fainting.\n  - Get up slowly from sitting/lying and after being in warm water.\n  - If you feel lightheaded, lie down immediately and elevate your legs; or do counterpressure maneuvers (leg crossing, tensing calves/thighs, handgrip) until it passes.\n  - Don’t swim alone, climb heights, or drive until evaluated.\n\nHelpful details to tell your clinician:\n- Any warning symptoms (nausea, warmth, tunnel vision, muffled hearing)\n- Whether anyone saw the event and how long you were out\n- Tongue bite (especially on the side), incontinence, head injury\n- How quickly you felt normal afterward\n- Recent sleep, food/fluid intake, heat exposure, alcohol/other substances\n- Family history of heart problems or sudden death\n\nIf this was a one-off with clear triggers and your evaluation is reassuring, the prognosis is generally good. Prevention (hydration, nutrition, avoiding cannabis/heat stacking, slow position changes) usually stops it from happening again. If anything like this recurs, seek urgent care.",

    "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
    "answer": "What you describe sounds most consistent with a focal-onset seizure that spread to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, followed by a post‑ictal period and a significant head injury from the fall.\n\nWhy this fits:\n- Brief “freeze”/behavioral arrest, then asymmetric facial movement on the right and forced head turning to the right suggest a focal seizure starting in the left hemisphere (often temporal or frontal lobe).\n- The burst of inappropriate laughter can occur as an ictal symptom (gelastic seizure), more often from temporal or frontal lobe seizures in adults.\n- Stiffening, fall, foaming at the mouth, and 5–7 minutes of unresponsiveness are typical of a generalized tonic‑clonic seizure with a post‑ictal phase.\n- Bleeding from the left ear after striking the head could be from a temporal/basilar skull fracture due to the fall; that is an emergency, which the medics rightly treated as such.\n\nCould this be a stroke? Stroke can sometimes precipitate a seizure, especially in older adults, and emergency teams will (and should) check for that. But the sequence of focal motor signs, ictal laughter, generalized convulsion, and post‑ictal confusion is more typical of a seizure than a primary stroke presentation. Still, in someone around 60 with a first seizure, stroke and other structural causes must be ruled out.\n\nWhat doctors usually do next:\n- Immediate CT head (already likely done) to assess for hemorrhage and fractures.\n- MRI brain with epilepsy protocol once stable, to look for underlying causes (prior small stroke, tumor, scarring, cortical lesion).\n- EEG to characterize seizure tendency.\n- Blood tests (glucose, electrolytes, sodium, kidney/liver function, toxicology if indicated).\n- Depending on findings, they may consider less common causes (e.g., autoimmune encephalitis) if the story evolves.\n\nImportant points to share with his clinicians:\n- The exact sequence and durations you observed (behavioral arrest → right facial “smile” → head turning right → brief unnatural laughter → stiffening/fall → unresponsiveness 5–7 min).\n- That there was foaming and bleeding from the left ear after hitting a metal board rim.\n- Any prior similar spells, new medications, sleep deprivation, alcohol use, recent illness—if anyone knows.\n\nIf you ever witness a similar event again:\n- Call emergency services.\n- Protect him from injury, ease him to the floor, pad the head, and roll him onto his side once the jerking allows.\n- Do not put anything in the mouth; don’t restrain limbs.\n- Time the event and note features (side of head/eye turning, speech changes, duration).\n\nBottom line: The pattern strongly suggests a focal seizure (likely left temporal/frontal) with secondary generalization, plus a serious head injury from the fall. Stroke as a trigger or mimic is possible and will be evaluated in the hospital.",

    "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it’s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn’t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
    "answer": "Short answer: this is pretty normal, but you shouldn’t be left at risk of running out. Many neurology clinics require follow‑ups every 3–12 months to renew anti‑seizure meds. Reasons include checking seizure control, side effects, interactions, and making sure the lamotrigine dose is still right. With lamotrigine specifically, interruptions can be risky because if you miss several days you may need to re‑titrate to avoid a serious rash.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Call the office today, ask the triage nurse or refill line for a “bridge” refill until tomorrow’s appointment (even 7–30 days). Most clinicians will do this once you’re on the schedule.\n- Ask your pharmacist about an emergency supply. In many U.S. states, pharmacists can dispense a short emergency refill of non‑controlled meds (often 72 hours or sometimes more) when the prescriber can’t be reached.\n- If you have a primary care clinician, they can often provide a short refill while you wait to see neurology.\n- If you do run out and can’t get a refill, don’t just stop. Missing doses increases seizure risk. If you miss several days, call your doctor before restarting—lamotrigine may need to be restarted at a lower dose and re‑titrated. If you have a seizure or withdrawal symptoms, seek urgent care/ER.\n\nWhy they want follow‑ups\n- Seizure control, side effects, mood changes\n- Interactions with new meds or substances\n- Dose adjustments (weight change, sleep, stress, adherence)\n- Safety counseling (driving laws, seizure precautions)\n\nHow to avoid this next time\n- Before leaving your appointment, book the next follow‑up and request enough refills to last until then.\n- Set refill reminders when you have 1 refill/month left.\n- Ask if, once stable, the clinic will allow 12‑month refills managed by your PCP, with neurology follow‑up annually.\n\nIt’s reasonable to feel frustrated, but it’s not uncommon policy. It’s also reasonable to ask the clinic to ensure continuity of care with a short bridge refill so you’re not forced into a dangerous gap. If you want, tell me your location and how many tablets you have left—I can suggest the likely emergency refill options where you live.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you’re describing—burning/tightness sensations, trouble concentrating, and short‑term memory problems—can happen with focal (partial) epilepsy, especially if the temporal lobes/hippocampus are involved. It’s very unlikely that you’re developing Alzheimer’s in your 30s. Early‑onset Alzheimer’s is rare, and epilepsy does not mean you are destined to get it. Memory problems in epilepsy are common and often improve once seizures are controlled and sleep, mood, and medications are optimized.\n\nKey points for you right now\n- A week and a half on carbamazepine (Zeptol) at 200 mg once daily then 200 mg twice daily is still very early and a relatively low dose. It can take several weeks to reach a steady, therapeutic dose and to see benefits. Some people notice temporary “slowed thinking” or fatigue at the start that improves as the brain adapts.\n- Memory can improve. If your memory issues are driven by frequent seizures, poor sleep, anxiety/depression, or medication side effects, they are often at least partly reversible with good seizure control and supportive treatments. If there is structural injury (for example, hippocampal sclerosis), there may be a persistent baseline weakness in new memory, but the brain can compensate and cognitive rehab helps.\n- Having focal epilepsy does increase long‑term dementia risk somewhat on a population level, but most people with epilepsy do not develop dementia, and good seizure control lowers that risk.\n\nWhat to ask your neurologist/do next\n1) Confirm the workup and diagnosis\n- Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol (to look at the hippocampi/temporal lobes).\n- EEG (ideally with sleep, and longer monitoring if needed) to confirm seizure focus and frequency.\n- Baseline and follow‑up labs for carbamazepine: drug level, sodium, liver function, blood count. Also check reversible causes of cognitive issues: B12, TSH (thyroid), vitamin D, folate; consider sleep apnea screening if you snore or are sleepy.\n- A formal neuropsychological evaluation. This provides an objective baseline of memory/attention and guides targeted therapy and workplace accommodations.\n\n2) Review all your medications\n- Please share the names of the “memory/concentration” and other meds you were given. Some drugs interact with carbamazepine or can worsen seizures or cognition. Carbamazepine also interacts with many medicines (including birth‑control pills) and can lower sodium.\n- If memory doesn’t improve after you reach a therapeutic dose and your seizures are controlled, ask about alternatives with a more “cognition‑neutral” profile (for many, lamotrigine or lacosamide; levetiracetam can affect mood in some). This is very individual—your neurologist will tailor it.\n\n3) Optimize seizure control and brain health\n- Keep a seizure/symptom diary (including “burning/tight” sensations, confusion spells, triggers, missed sleep, stress, and meds).\n- Prioritize 7–9 hours of consistent sleep; treat sleep apnea if present.\n- Limit alcohol and recreational drugs; manage stress; regular aerobic exercise; Mediterranean‑style diet.\n- Treat depression/anxiety—both are common in epilepsy and strongly affect memory and concentration.\n\n4) Cognitive rehabilitation and practical supports\n- Ask for referral to speech‑language pathology or neuropsychology for cognitive rehab.\n- Use external memory aids: calendar/to‑do apps with alerts, take written notes, record (with permission) meetings, summarize action items to a colleague at the end.\n- At work, consider temporary accommodations instead of quitting: quieter workspace, shorter meetings, written agendas, flexible schedule, brief medical leave if needed.\n\nSafety and side effects to watch\n- Seek urgent care if you develop a widespread rash, mouth/eye sores, fever, or severe skin peeling (rare but serious reactions to carbamazepine), severe confusion, repeated vomiting, or very drowsy spells.\n- Call your doctor promptly if you have new/worse mood changes or suicidal thoughts; severe dizziness/imbalance; or symptoms of low sodium (headache, nausea, confusion).\n- If you have Asian ancestry, ask whether HLA‑B*1502 testing was done before starting carbamazepine due to rare severe skin reaction risk.\n- Follow your local driving/safety laws for seizures until you meet seizure‑free requirements.\n\nWhat to expect\n- It’s reasonable that you don’t feel better yet at 1.5 weeks. Many people need 4–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose to judge benefit. Some cognitive fog early on can be from the medication itself and often settles.\n- If after a fair trial (adequate dose and time) your seizures are controlled but memory remains poor, push for the MRI/EEG review, neuropsych testing, sleep/mood evaluation, and a medication rethink. If things remain unclear, a second opinion at an epilepsy center is appropriate.\n\nIf you can, please list the other medications you were prescribed and what testing you’ve already had (MRI/EEG/labs). I can help you prepare specific questions for your next appointment and suggest workplace accommodations tailored to your role. You don’t have to face this alone, and there are many paths to improvement.",

    "question": " Yet another EDIT: I fainted today on my way to the store and was brought into the hospital. They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder. Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.",
    "answer": "You don’t sound insane at all. What you’re describing fits with what the hospital found, and you’ve already taken the right steps by getting evaluated.\n\nAbout the “silent” seizures\n- These are often brief absence or focal impaired-awareness seizures—people can seem “zoned out,” lose awareness for a few seconds, and sometimes stay standing. Sleep deprivation and anxiety can trigger more of them.\n- Next steps: keep close follow-up with neurology, start any meds they recommend, and keep a simple seizure diary (time, what happened, triggers, meds, sleep).\n- Safety right now:\n  - Don’t drive until your neurologist clears you (laws vary by location).\n  - Showers instead of baths; no swimming alone; avoid heights, ladders, open flames, and power tools when alone.\n  - Prioritize regular sleep, steady meals/fluids, and avoid alcohol/recreational drugs.\n- Seizure first aid for others: time it, keep you safe on your side, don’t put anything in your mouth, call emergency services if it lasts >5 minutes, clusters without full recovery, or there’s injury/breathing trouble.\n\nAbout possible gastroparesis\n- Fits with early fullness, nausea/vomiting, and weight loss. Causes include idiopathic (common), post-viral, diabetes, or meds that slow the gut (opioids, anticholinergics, some GLP‑1s).\n- Gastric emptying study: usually you eat a small radiolabeled meal with scans over ~4 hours. You’ll typically fast beforehand and may need to hold meds that affect motility (prokinetics like metoclopramide/erythromycin, opioids, anticholinergics, some diabetes meds, nicotine). Follow your lab’s instructions exactly.\n- Eating until your test/appointments:\n  - 5–6 small meals; chew well; favor soft/puréed and liquid calories.\n  - Low-fat, low-fiber (especially avoid tough meats, raw fibrous veggies, skins, seeds, nuts); blended soups, yogurt, oatmeal, eggs, smoothies (strained), and oral nutrition drinks are often easier.\n  - Sip fluids through the day; consider oral rehydration solutions if vomiting.\n  - Gentle walking 10–20 minutes after meals; avoid carbonated drinks.\n  - Ask your GI about short-term meds for nausea (e.g., ondansetron) or prokinetics if appropriate.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- You can’t keep liquids down for 24 hours, signs of dehydration (very dark urine, dizziness), blood or coffee‑ground vomit, black stools, severe belly pain/bloating with no gas/stool, or rapid ongoing weight loss.\n- Seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, head injury, or trouble breathing afterward.\n\nAlso helpful\n- Review your current meds with your doctors: some lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, tramadol, some antipsychotics/stimulants) or slow the gut (opioids, anticholinergics, some GLP‑1s).\n- Consider a medical alert bracelet and share a seizure action plan with someone you trust.\n\nIf you want, I can give you:\n- A short printable seizure first-aid sheet for friends/family.\n- A simple gastroparesis-friendly starter grocery list and 2–3 meal ideas.",

I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn’t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can’t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure. I have had no history of seizures before. I am so scared to sleep right now fearing that something might happen. It’s probably about a year that this situation while i am trying to sleep happens. Wold really love to have an EEG bit when i went to the neurologist a year ago he only diagnosed me with anxiety combined with elements of OCD. He did some reflex/eyesight tests and all came back with no neurological deficit. I’d get an EEG but i am literally such a hypochondriac that my parents are concerned and i just went through blood tests and i don’t want to worry them again! If anyone has any idea i’d be so glad :)",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—what you’re describing is very scary when you’re trying to sleep. The good news is that most of what you’ve listed is common in anxiety and around the sleep–wake transition, and it doesn’t sound like a brain tumor or an impending “grand mal” seizure.\n\nWhat your symptoms could fit\n- Anxiety/panic and health anxiety/OCD: can cause racing heart, ear/head buzzing, depersonalization, intrusive/nonsense thoughts, sleep-onset insomnia, and more attention to normal body sensations.\n- Sleep-transition phenomena (benign):\n  - Hypnic jerks and “vibrations” as you’re falling asleep.\n  - Hypnagogic thoughts/imagery (odd, fragmented thoughts) at sleep onset.\n  - “Exploding head syndrome” (a sudden internal buzzing/boom/zap as you’re dozing off) and tinnitus flares—harmless but startling; worse with stress and poor sleep.\n- Deja vu: very common in healthy people, especially when stressed or sleep-deprived. In epilepsy it’s usually very stereotyped and paired with other clear features (below).\n- Palpitations on waking: common with anxiety, adrenaline surges, or poor sleep.\n\nSigns that would make seizures more likely\nSee a doctor promptly or go to urgent care/ER if you develop any of the following:\n- Spells that are brief (30–90 sec), very stereotyped, and include loss of awareness, blank staring, repeated movements (lip smacking/hand fumbling), an intense rising feeling in the stomach, strong odors/tastes, and confusion afterward.\n- Convulsions, tongue biting, incontinence, or injuries during spells.\n- New, progressive neurological symptoms (weakness, speech trouble, vision loss), persistent morning vomiting, or worsening headaches that are new and different—especially with abnormal neuro exam.\n\nWhy this is unlikely to be a brain tumor\n- Your neuro exam was normal, and your symptoms have been fluctuating for a year without progressive neurological deficits—both are reassuring.\n- Tumors at your age are rare and usually cause persistent, progressive focal symptoms or clear seizure events.\n\nAbout an EEG\n- EEGs are useful when there are recurrent, stereotyped spells suggestive of seizures. Routine EEGs can be normal even in epilepsy and can also show nonspecific changes that raise anxiety.\n- If you begin having the red-flag features above, talk to your doctor about a repeat evaluation and possibly an ambulatory EEG (longer recording) or a sleep study if sleep events are the main issue.\n\nWhat you can do tonight\n- Breathing to stop the adrenaline surge: try 4-7-8 or box breathing for 3–5 minutes.\n- Grounding if you feel depersonalized: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.\n- Reduce sensory quiet if the buzzing is loud: gentle fan/white noise, soft music.\n- Avoid stimulants this evening (caffeine/energy drinks/nicotine/THC) and bright screens for 1 hour before bed.\n- If your mind races, do a 10-minute “worry write-out” outside the bedroom, then return to bed.\n- If you don’t fall asleep in ~20 minutes, get up and do something calming in dim light, then return to bed sleepy.\n\nShort-term plan\n- Keep a simple symptom diary (time, what you felt, how long, any loss of awareness, triggers). Video from a phone during an episode can be very helpful for a clinician.\n- If palpitations are frequent or prolonged, ask your primary care doctor about checking thyroid, iron, and possibly a short heart monitor—these are common, treatable contributors to anxiety-like symptoms.\n- For tinnitus: protect from loud noise, limit caffeine, stay hydrated. See a clinician if it’s one-sided, pulsatile (beats with your pulse), or associated with hearing loss.\n\nAnxiety/OCD care\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy (especially ERP for OCD/health anxiety) is very effective.\n- If therapy alone isn’t enough, discuss medication options (e.g., SSRIs) with your clinician.\n- Share your fears with your parents and your doctor; you can ask for a balanced plan that addresses your anxiety while avoiding unnecessary testing.\n\nIf you’re willing, a few clarifying questions can help:\n- During these episodes, do you ever lose time or awareness, or has anyone noticed you staring and not responding?\n- Any odd smells/tastes or a rising “rollercoaster” stomach feeling before an episode?\n- Any tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or prolonged confusion afterward?\n- Do loud sounds in your head or vibrations happen exactly as you’re falling asleep or waking?\n\nIf any red-flag features start appearing, seek medical care promptly. Otherwise, what you’ve described most strongly fits anxiety plus normal sleep-transition phenomena, which are very treatable. You’re not alone in this, and it doesn’t sound like you’re on the brink of a seizure.",

    "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3’s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I’m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I’m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I’ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven’t been tested). I’m currently having pain way worse than usual and I’m convinced it’s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had “multiple follicles” (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn’t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3’s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn’t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn’t let me speak, and said “I guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients”. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I’m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I’ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I’m in excruciating pain and I don’t want to be chewing on codeine. I’m just so frustrated. I’m an active 23 year old grad student, I’m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I’m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I’m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you were treated that way. Your concerns are valid, and the symptoms you’re describing (severe unilateral pelvic pain radiating to the back/abdomen, PCOS with enlarged/multifollicular ovaries) absolutely warrant ruling out ovarian torsion or a ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst—both can be surgical.\n\nKey points about torsion (for you to advocate with):\n- Vomiting is common but NOT required. If you’re taking ondansetron, nausea/vomiting can be masked.\n- Ultrasound can miss torsion; normal or even “some flow” on Doppler does not exclude it.\n- CT is poor at ruling out torsion. It’s useful for appendicitis/diverticulitis but should not be used to “rule out torsion.”\n- Intermittent torsion can cause waxing/waning pain. Persistent severe pain is an emergency.\n\nWhat to do now\n- If your pain is still severe, worsening, or different from your usual endo pain, go back to the ED today (or a different ED where gynecology is on call, if possible). Bring someone to advocate if you can.\n- Use clear language: “I’m concerned about ovarian torsion given PCOS and severe unilateral pelvic pain. Nausea may be masked by ondansetron. CT won’t rule out torsion. I need urgent gynecology involvement and a repeat transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler by an experienced sonographer. If inconclusive but suspicion remains, please consider diagnostic laparoscopy.”\n- Ask them to document your seizure disorder and the risk of increased seizures with uncontrolled pain, sleep loss, and dehydration. Request seizure-safe analgesia.\n\nRed flags that should trigger immediate ED return:\n- Pain that is severe/persistent or suddenly worse\n- Fainting/lightheadedness, shoulder-tip pain, or new heavy vaginal bleeding (possible internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst)\n- Fever, persistent vomiting despite ondansetron, or inability to keep fluids down\n- Increasing seizure auras or any seizure\n\nPain control and seizure safety at home (while you seek care)\n- Hydration, heat to the lower abdomen/back, and rest. Avoid alcohol.\n- If you were prescribed oral ketorolac (Toradol): do not combine with any other NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen). Use the lowest effective dose, and do not exceed 5 days total due to kidney/GI risk. Take with food; consider a PPI if you have gastritis/ulcer risk.\n- If you were not taking ketorolac: ibuprofen 600–800 mg every 6–8 hours or naproxen 500 mg then 250–500 mg every 12 hours, plus acetaminophen 650–1000 mg every 6–8 hours (do not exceed 3,000 mg acetaminophen/day total). Watch the acetaminophen content in Tylenol 3 (each T3 has 300 mg).\n- Opioids: short-term use as prescribed is unlikely to cause dependence. In epilepsy, avoid tramadol and meperidine (higher seizure risk). Codeine and morphine are generally safer with your meds, but can cause sedation/constipation—don’t drive, and start a bowel regimen (PEG 17 g daily or docusate/senna; hydrate).\n- Keep taking your antiepileptics on schedule. If you have a prescribed rescue med for seizures (e.g., clonazepam or intranasal midazolam), keep it accessible.\n\nCoordination and follow-up\n- Call your excision surgeon’s office first thing in the morning, explain your current symptoms and ER visits, and ask for urgent triage or for them to coordinate evaluation for torsion/ruptured cyst. Ask if there’s a gyne on-call they can liaise with.\n- If you return to the ED, ask explicitly for gynecology to be involved early. A repeat high-quality transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler is reasonable; if still inconclusive but torsion remains on the table clinically, diagnostic laparoscopy is the standard.\n- If constipation from codeine worsens your pain, ask for a different pain plan (e.g., NSAID + acetaminophen ± a small amount of morphine) and a bowel regimen.\n\nMedication interactions/notes specific to you\n- Keppra and lamotrigine have minimal interactions with codeine, morphine, ketorolac, or ondansetron. Monitor for sedation/dizziness when combining lamotrigine with opioids.\n- Avoid exceeding acetaminophen limits with Tylenol 3.\n- Ondansetron is generally seizure-safe; watch for constipation.\n- Do not use tramadol.\n\nBottom line: with excruciating unilateral pelvic pain and PCOS, torsion and ruptured cyst are real concerns. If your pain remains severe, go back to the ED now and ask for gynecology involvement; don’t let a normal CT or “some flow” on Doppler falsely reassure them. In the meantime, use seizure-safe pain control, stay hydrated, and protect your sleep as much as possible.",

    "question": "Here’s my info: 21F, 160lbs, 5’2”, White; preexisting conditions include Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and Asthma; non drinker, but I do vape and smoke weed Current medications: Zoloft 100mg 1x/day AM, Adderall 10mg as needed for school/work, Fluticasone inhaler (Advair) 2x/day, Singulair 10mg 1x/day PM, Xyzal 5mg 1x/day PM, Ventolin inhaler as needed, Keppra 500mg 2x/day I made a post about this a few months ago. I went through a few details about these weird “episodes” I’d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I’ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started. I’m really just making a post to gather more insight and experiences from doctors and other people as well. If anyone has any insight as to what could be causing this, it would be much appreciated. This diagnosis has kinda knocked me on my ass, as I can’t drive for 6 months after my last seizure. While I’m glad my scans/tests were unremarkable, I wish I had gotten some sort of answer.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. New-onset seizures with normal CT/MRI/EEG is frustratingly common, and it doesn’t mean “nothing’s wrong”—just that the cause isn’t obvious on basic tests. Many people with epilepsy have a normal MRI and a routine EEG.\n\nWhat could be going on\n- Idiopathic epilepsy: No clear structural cause; often starts in teens/20s. Routine EEG can miss seizures (single EEG sensitivity is only ~50%).\n- Subtle structural causes: Small cortical malformations can be missed on standard MRI. A 3T MRI with an epilepsy protocol at a center experienced in epilepsy increases pickup.\n- Triggers/lowered seizure threshold layered on top of epilepsy:\n  - Sleep deprivation, stress, illness, hormonal fluctuations (catamenial epilepsy around menses), flashing lights/screens.\n  - Substances: nicotine/vaping and high-THC cannabis can lower seizure threshold; stimulants (including amphetamines) can as well. Alcohol withdrawal is a classic trigger (you don’t drink).\n  - Medications/side effects: SSRIs are generally safe but can rarely lower sodium (hyponatremia) and provoke seizures; albuterol in large doses can cause electrolyte shifts. Adderall can lower seizure threshold in some people with epilepsy; careful use or switching to methylphenidate may be safer.\n- Less common causes to consider if the course is atypical: autoimmune epilepsy (often comes with rapidly changing behavior, memory issues, movement/autonomic symptoms), prior head injury, or sleep apnea.\n\nWhy your tests may be “normal”\n- MRI: Standard MRIs can miss subtle lesions. Ask for a 3T “epilepsy protocol” MRI read by an epileptologist/neuro-radiologist.\n- EEG: A routine 20–30 minute EEG often misses intermittent epileptiform activity. Yield improves with sleep deprivation, prolonged/ambulatory EEG, or inpatient video EEG monitoring.\n\nAbout your current treatment\n- Keppra 500 mg twice daily is a common starting dose, but many adults need more for full control. Typical effective daily doses are 1000–3000 mg. Ongoing focal seizures suggest you may need a dose increase, a different/add-on antiseizure med, and/or confirmation of the diagnosis with longer EEG.\n- Keppra can worsen mood/irritability. Given MDD/GAD, let your clinician know about any mood changes. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50–100 mg/day can help some with Keppra-related irritability. If mood issues are significant or seizures persist, alternatives like lamotrigine, lacosamide, or oxcarbazepine are commonly used for focal seizures.\n- ADHD meds in epilepsy: can be used, but best under your neurologist/psychiatrist’s guidance. Consider avoiding PRN amphetamine “spikes,” using the lowest effective dose, earlier in the day, or switching to methylphenidate if needed.\n- Women’s health: If you could become pregnant, start folic acid 0.4–1 mg daily now. Keppra is among the safer options in pregnancy. Keppra does not reduce birth control effectiveness.\n\nPractical steps you can take now\n- See an epileptologist (neurologist specializing in seizures), ideally at a comprehensive epilepsy center.\n- Ask about:\n  - 3T MRI with epilepsy protocol.\n  - Prolonged/ambulatory or inpatient video-EEG to capture events and refine the diagnosis.\n  - Keppra dose optimization or med adjustment; rescue medication (e.g., intranasal midazolam/diazepam) for any future prolonged convulsive seizure or clusters.\n  - Checking basic labs (sodium, glucose, calcium, magnesium; Keppra level if adherence is uncertain).\n  - Screening for catamenial patterns; consider a diary that logs seizure timing, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, missed doses, cannabis/vape use, Adderall timing, illness.\n- Lifestyle/trigger control:\n  - Prioritize 7–9 hours of consistent sleep.\n  - Avoid or reduce vaping and THC; if you choose to use cannabis, avoid high-THC products. Don’t self-treat with over-the-counter CBD—products are unreliable.\n  - Limit caffeine and energy drinks.\n  - Manage stress; regular meals; hydrate.\n  - Avoid swimming alone, climbing heights, baths (take showers), and operating heavy machinery. Share a seizure first-aid plan with people around you.\n- Mental health: Watch for worsening mood/anxiety on Keppra or with montelukast (known neuropsychiatric side effects). If mood worsens, tell your clinicians—this can guide med selection.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- A seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, a serious injury/head strike, fever/stiff neck, or new focal weakness/confusion.\n- Dramatic new psychiatric symptoms (agitation/psychosis), severe memory problems, or abnormal movements—discuss promptly; these can point to autoimmune causes that need different workup.\n\nDriving\n- Follow your state’s law (often 6 months seizure-free). Ask your neurologist to document the plan; sometimes medication optimization shortens time to control.\n\nA few questions that can help your team\n- What do your focal episodes feel like (deja vu, rising stomach, fear, smell/taste, speech arrest), how long do they last, and is there a pattern with your menstrual cycle?\n- Any recent head injury, infections (including COVID), new supplements/energy drinks?\n- Do episodes cluster with poor sleep, days you use Adderall, or after vaping/weed?\n\nI know the lack of a clear cause is unsettling, but with the right testing (longer EEG, epilepsy-protocol MRI) and med adjustments, most people achieve good control. If you want, share more detail about what your “partial seizures” feel like and any patterns you’ve noticed, and I can help you think through triggers and next steps to discuss with your neurologist.",

    "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5’7” Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re both going through this. A few key points that may help:\n\n1) About Xifaxan (rifaximin), “bathroom every hour,” and hepatic encephalopathy (HE)\n- Rifaximin itself usually does not cause frequent bowel movements. The “going to the bathroom every hour” side effect is almost always from lactulose, not rifaximin.\n- Standard care for recurrent HE is lactulose titrated to 2–3 soft stools per day plus rifaximin. If someone is having hourly stools, the lactulose dose is too high and should be adjusted, not stopped entirely. Overuse can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances (low sodium), which can worsen confusion and can trigger seizures.\n- If he truly cannot tolerate lactulose despite dose adjustment, rifaximin alone is better than nothing, but the combination is most effective at preventing HE recurrences and hospitalizations.\n\n2) Could stopping rifaximin cause seizures?\n- Stopping rifaximin increases the risk of HE recurrence. Seizures are not a classic feature of HE, but they can occur, particularly when HE is severe or when there are metabolic triggers.\n- Much more commonly, seizures in cirrhosis are triggered by:\n  - Low sodium (hyponatremia) or other electrolyte problems (low magnesium, low glucose)\n  - Alcohol withdrawal or intoxication\n  - Infections, GI bleeding, constipation\n  - Certain medications that lower seizure threshold\n- Given he was taking salt tablets for low sodium and was told to stop, hyponatremia is a real concern and is a well-known seizure trigger in cirrhosis.\n\n3) Keppra (levetiracetam)\n- Often a good choice for people with liver disease because it’s mostly cleared by the kidneys and has few interactions. It helps prevent further seizures while the underlying cause is addressed.\n\n4) What to check and discuss with his doctors soon\n- Clarify exactly which meds he’s on for HE. Is he on lactulose? Did he stop rifaximin? If bowel frequency is the main issue, ask to retitrate lactulose to the goal of 2–3 soft stools/day, not hourly. Do not use anti-diarrheals with lactulose.\n- Labs: sodium, potassium, creatinine, bicarbonate, liver panel, INR, magnesium, phosphate, glucose, CBC, ammonia (can help but doesn’t always correlate with symptoms), and an infection screen (urinalysis, chest X-ray if symptomatic).\n- Review all meds and avoid sedatives like benzodiazepines and zolpidem; minimize opioids; be cautious with PPIs unless clearly needed (they can increase HE risk).\n- Nutrition: in cirrhosis with HE, adequate protein is important (generally 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day if tolerated). A late-evening protein snack helps. Thiamine supplementation (e.g., 100 mg/day) is reasonable if any ongoing alcohol use or poor intake.\n- Hyponatremia: no salt tablets unless specifically advised by his liver team. Management is usually careful fluid/salt strategy and diuretic adjustments. Over-diuresis can worsen sodium.\n- MRI brain and possibly EEG are appropriate to look for other seizure causes.\n- Safety: no driving, swimming alone, ladders/power tools until seizure-free per local rules. Fall precautions at home.\n\n5) Alcohol\n- Even “a few beers nightly” can worsen HE, sodium balance, and seizure risk, and it increases bleeding and infection risks. Stopping completely is the single most impactful step he can take. If he’s open to it, his team can offer medications or support to help.\n\n6) Will seizures lead to coma or death?\n- Brief, controlled seizures typically don’t cause coma by themselves. The danger is the underlying trigger (e.g., severe HE, very low sodium, infection, GI bleeding) and the possibility of a prolonged seizure (status epilepticus). That’s why prompt evaluation and prevention of triggers is critical.\n\n7) If lactulose is a deal-breaker for him\n- Make sure he understands the bowel goal is 2–3 soft stools/day, not hourly. Dose can be reduced and spaced, and skin care (barrier creams) can improve comfort.\n- If he cannot tolerate lactulose despite careful titration, discuss rifaximin monotherapy rather than stopping HE therapy entirely.\n- In some settings, alternatives like lactitol (where available) or short courses of PEG are used under specialist guidance.\n\nRed flags that should prompt urgent care now:\n- Confusion, sleepiness, agitation, or personality change beyond his baseline\n- Another seizure, persistent vomiting, black/tarry stools, vomiting blood, fever, severe abdominal pain\n- Worsening jaundice, inability to keep fluids down, very poor oral intake, or falls/head injury\n\nBottom line\n- Seizures are more likely due to low sodium or other precipitating factors than rifaximin itself. Stopping rifaximin increases HE risk. The frequent bathroom trips are almost certainly from lactulose and can usually be fixed by adjusting the dose rather than abandoning treatment.\n- Ask his liver team to: retitrate lactulose to the stool goal, restart or continue rifaximin, check labs (especially sodium and magnesium), review meds and alcohol, and complete the MRI/EEG workup. Keppra is appropriate in the meantime.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a concise message to his doctor summarizing these concerns and asking about a lactulose plan, rifaximin, and electrolyte monitoring.",

    "question": "19F 167cm 59kg chinese in UK // \"passing out\" under certain conditions, suspected focal epilepsy?? duration: 3+ years?? (no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",
    "answer": "I can’t diagnose you, but what you describe is very concerning for reflex (photosensitive) seizures rather than simple fainting. The pattern—bright/flickering lights in a dim setting (concert strobes, projector in a dark room, night driving), a brief prodrome (dizzy/nauseous/slow), eyes rolling with loss of awareness, clusters of repeated episodes, and confusion after—fits photosensitive epilepsy or an occipital-lobe focal seizure triggered by visual stimuli. Simple fainting (vasovagal syncope) is less likely given the specific light triggers, repeated events in succession, and post-event confusion.\n\nWhat to do now (safety first)\n- Stop driving until you’ve been assessed by a doctor. In the UK, seizures must be reported to the DVLA; driving is paused until cleared. Even outside the UK, the same safety principle applies.\n- Avoid triggers: concerts with strobes, dark rooms with bright screens, night driving, VR/headsets, video games with flashing patterns, and rapidly flickering LEDs.\n- If exposure is unavoidable:\n  - Keep the room well-lit (avoid high contrast).\n  - Look away immediately or cover one eye with the palm (reduces the trigger effect).\n  - Sit farther from screens; lower screen brightness and contrast; avoid full-screen high-contrast patterns; use higher refresh rate screens if possible; avoid VR.\n  - Consider tinted lenses designed for photosensitivity (some blue/rose tints reduce photic-induced responses); wraparound or polarized lenses can help with glare. This is supportive, not a substitute for medical care.\n- General seizure precautions: shower instead of bath, don’t swim alone, avoid heights/open flames/operating machinery, let friends/housemates know how to help.\n\nSeek medical care as soon as you can (locally if possible—don’t wait months)\nAsk for:\n- Neurology evaluation.\n- EEG with intermittent photic and pattern stimulation (ideally video-EEG). A sleep-deprived EEG can increase yield.\n- Brain MRI (to rule out a structural focal cause, especially with visual/occipital features).\n- Basic labs: glucose, electrolytes, CBC and ferritin, pregnancy test if relevant.\n- ECG to screen for arrhythmic causes of loss of consciousness.\n\nUntil you’re seen, keep a seizure diary:\n- Date/time, trigger (type of light/pattern, how long exposed), what you felt before, how long unconscious, any limb jerking, tongue biting (especially on the side), incontinence, skin color changes, how long until you felt normal again, relation to sleep deprivation, alcohol, stress, illness, or your menstrual cycle. Ask a witness to record a discreet video if it’s safe.\n\nWhy this matters\n- If this is epilepsy, treatment can greatly reduce or stop events and lower risk of injury. Certain medications (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine; valproate is effective but generally avoided in women of childbearing age) are commonly used; sometimes short-term clobazam is used before predictable triggers. Your neurologist will tailor this.\n- If it’s syncope, the management is very different—so getting the right diagnosis is key.\n\nGo to urgent care/emergency now if\n- Any event lasts more than 5 minutes, or repeated events occur without full recovery in between.\n- You sustain a head injury, have severe headache, persistent confusion >30 minutes, new weakness/numbness, fever/stiff neck, or you’re pregnant.\n- You have chest pain, palpitations, or faint during exertion.\n\nPractical tips for screens and lights\n- Keep ambient lighting on; avoid watching bright content in a dark room.\n- Reduce screen brightness/contrast; sit back; avoid rapidly flashing content.\n- Avoid strobe effects (10–20 Hz flashes are particularly provocative).\n- If you feel the warning signs, look away immediately, cover one eye, and leave the environment.\n\nIf you share your location, I can suggest how to access neurology/EEG locally. In the meantime, please treat this as potentially epileptic and prioritize safety and prompt evaluation.",

Based on your description, a few possibilities are on the table, and the EEG plus a careful history/video will help sort them out.\n\nThings that can look similar:\n- Parasomnia (night terror/confusional arousal): common with sudden screaming, inconsolability, appearing “awake” but not responsive, and then settling; usually no rhythmic jerking, and kids return to baseline once fully awake.\n- Seizure: can present as staring/unresponsiveness with or without rhythmic jerking or stiffening, eye deviation, color change, or drooling, followed by sleepiness.\n- Infantile spasms (important to flag at 3–12 months): brief, often clustered jerks (head bob/arms/torso flexing or extending), commonly after waking, with brief pauses between jerks. Catching these early matters—if you see clusters, seek urgent care.\n- Benign sleep myoclonus: quick jerks during drowsiness/sleep that stop when fully awakened, without altered responsiveness.\n\nWhat you can do now:\n- If it happens again, try to record a clear video from the side. Note: time of day, how long it lasts, whether there’s eye deviation, rhythmic movements, skin color change (pale/blue), breathing changes, vomiting, loss of urine/stool, and how long it takes to return to normal.\n- Ask yourself: any fever or illness? Any recent head bump, new exposures/medicines, or family history of seizures? Any changes in milestones or new loss of skills.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care/ER:\n- The episode lasts 5 minutes or more, or there are repeated episodes without full recovery in between.\n- Color turns blue/gray, breathing seems impaired, or there is choking/vomiting you can’t clear.\n- There is significant injury, persistent unresponsiveness, or you suspect infantile spasms (repeated brief jerks in a cluster, especially around waking).\n- First seizure with fever or if he appears very ill.\n\nIf it happens again (seizure first aid):\n- Lay him on his side on a flat, safe surface; don’t put anything in his mouth; don’t restrain.\n- Loosen tight clothing, note the time, and watch breathing and color.\n- Call 911 if it goes past 5 minutes or any of the red flags above occur.\n\nAbout the EEG:\n- A normal EEG doesn’t completely rule out seizures, but it’s very helpful.\n- If events recur or the EEG is abnormal, ask about a pediatric neurology referral.\n- Mention specifically any brief, repeated “head bobs” or clusters of jerks around sleep transitions, and any developmental regression—these would prompt faster evaluation.\n\nSince he’s back to baseline and you’ve already seen his doctor, it’s reasonable to monitor closely while you await the EEG. Bring any videos and notes to the visit. If you notice fever, illness, or any of the red flags, seek care sooner.",

    "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. Based on what you’ve described, you need a fresh, thorough re‑evaluation with an epilepsy specialist (epileptologist). You’ve clearly lost reliable control, diet alone isn’t enough anymore, and you’re limiting your life because of it. That’s a sign to change strategy rather than wait it out.\n\nWhat might be going on\n- Relapse of an underlying epilepsy after stopping medication. Antibiotics/illness can lower seizure threshold and “unmask” it again.\n- The current medicine (oxcarbazepine) may no longer be the best fit. In some generalized/myoclonic epilepsies, sodium‑channel drugs (carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine) can actually worsen myoclonus.\n- Potential contributors since the H. pylori episode:\n  - Certain antibiotics (especially fluoroquinolones, imipenem, and sometimes metronidazole) can provoke seizures while taking them.\n  - PPIs like omeprazole can cause low magnesium, which can trigger myoclonus/seizures; they can also cause B12 deficiency over time.\n  - Oxcarbazepine itself can cause low sodium, which can worsen seizures, dizziness, or gait instability.\n  - Sleep loss, stress, sudden high‑carb meals/rapid glucose swings, dehydration, and electrolyte shifts (from fasting/keto) all lower seizure threshold.\n- It’s possible your seizure type is myoclonic (the violent arm jerks, “drop” sensation) and needs a broad‑spectrum antiseizure medication rather than oxcarbazepine.\n\nWhat I’d do next (priority steps)\n1) See an epileptologist ASAP (or your neurologist with a low threshold for a second opinion). Given your current impairment walking and fear of public situations, ask for an urgent slot. If episodes escalate to loss of awareness, falls, or clustering, go to urgent care/ER.\n\n2) Update diagnostics:\n- EEG with sleep deprivation or prolonged ambulatory/video EEG to characterize seizure type.\n- Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol if not done or not recent.\n- Labs now: sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, kidney/liver function, fasting glucose or A1c, vitamin B12, TSH. If you’re still on/just took a PPI, magnesium is especially important.\n\n3) Medication strategy discussion (don’t wait months on diet alone):\n- Consider switching to or adding a broad‑spectrum antiseizure medication effective for myoclonic/generalized seizures (examples your doctor may consider: levetiracetam, valproate, topiramate, zonisamide). Lamotrigine can help but may worsen myoclonus in some.\n- Oxcarbazepine may not be ideal if this is a generalized/myoclonic syndrome. Also, check your sodium if you’re on it now.\n- The right drug at the right dose often restores normal life. Many people regain full control after relapse.\n\n4) GERD/H. pylori aftermath:\n- If you need acid suppression, consider discussing switching from a PPI to an H2 blocker (e.g., famotidine) and check magnesium if you remain on a PPI.\n- Confirm H. pylori eradication (stool antigen or breath test off PPI for 2 weeks).\n- Non‑drug GERD measures: early dinners, head‑of‑bed elevation, avoid late caffeine/alcohol, high‑fat late meals, mint.\n\n5) Diet and lifestyle (useful, but as adjuncts now):\n- If keto helps, do it in a structured, medically supervised way (Modified Atkins or low‑glycemic index treatment can be easier to sustain). Ensure:\n  - Fluids and electrolytes (sodium 3–5 g/day if no contraindication, plus potassium and magnesium intake).\n  - Regular meals; avoid long fasts and big carb spikes.\n  - Adequate sleep; avoid alcohol, energy drinks, and sleep deprivation.\n- Keep a seizure/trigger diary (sleep, stress, meals, reflux flares, meds/supplements).\n\n6) Safety until controlled:\n- Don’t drive; know your state’s seizure‑free rules.\n- Avoid heights, swimming alone, hot tubs, operating heavy machinery, and bathing in a tub (showers are safer).\n- If you feel an episode coming: sit or lie down, focus on slow breathing, and wait it out.\n\nWill this go away?\n- Many people regain excellent control after relapse once the correct medication regimen is chosen and triggers are managed. It’s unlikely to resolve reliably with diet alone given your current limitation. The goal is to get you back to normal life; that’s very feasible with appropriate treatment.\n\nHelpful details to share with your neurologist (and with me, if you want me to help you prepare):\n- Your original diagnosis details: EEG/MRI findings, exact seizure types, age at onset, any family history.\n- Exact antibiotics you took for H. pylori (names and dates), and how long you were on omeprazole.\n- Current meds and supplements, and any recent lab results (especially sodium and magnesium).\n- Pattern of episodes now: time of day (morning?), relation to sleep, alcohol/caffeine, exercise, meals, reflux symptoms, and whether awareness is preserved.\n- Any complete loss of consciousness, tongue biting, injuries, or incontinence.\n\nIf you can’t get in with your neurologist quickly, ask your primary care to:\n- Order the basic labs above urgently.\n- Start the referral to an epileptologist.\n- Consider interim management or an alternative ASM in consultation with neurology.\n\nIf at any point you develop prolonged confusion, clusters of jerks that don’t stop, a generalized convulsion, head injury, or new focal weakness, go to the ER.\n\nIf you share the antibiotic names, recent labs, and any prior EEG/MRI results, I can help you think through next steps and questions for your visit.",

    "question": "I took my epilepsy meds about 1.5h ago, Divalproex Sodium 250mg. I want to take a regular Gravol (not nighttime) so I can get to sleep earlier. I know it's not the best sleep aid but I don't have anything else at home currently and I want to fix my awful schedule.I read something about diphenhydramine triggering seizures but I'm not sure how similar it is to dimenhydrinate which is in Gravol so I'm a little worried as I haven't had one in years.",
    "answer": "Short answer: Gravol (dimenhydrinate) is essentially diphenhydramine in a different form. It carries the same “lowers the seizure threshold” concern as diphenhydramine, especially at higher doses or in overdose.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n- Interaction with divalproex: No dangerous drug–drug interaction is known, but you can get additive drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired coordination. Avoid alcohol and other sedatives.\n- Seizure risk: In people with epilepsy, first‑generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, doxylamine) are generally discouraged for sleep because they can provoke seizures. The absolute risk from a single standard dose is likely low, but it isn’t zero.\n\nIf you decide to use it anyway tonight:\n- Use the minimum effective dose (e.g., 25 mg; do not exceed 50 mg).\n- Do not repeat doses or stack with any other sedating meds/alcohol.\n- Make your sleep environment safe (don’t drive, avoid risky activities).\n- If you notice any unusual jerks/twitches, confusion, or aura symptoms, don’t take more and seek help if needed.\n\nSafer options for sleep in epilepsy:\n- Non‑drug steps tonight: dim lights/screens 1–2 hours before bed, cool/dark room, a brief warm shower, relaxation/slow breathing, and a consistent wake time tomorrow. Avoid naps and caffeine late day.\n- For future nights: consider melatonin 1–3 mg 1–2 hours before bed; generally considered safer in epilepsy. Talk to your neurologist or pharmacist about better long‑term options if sleep is a recurring issue.\n\nIf you want, tell me your age and any other meds or conditions, and I can be more specific. A quick call to a pharmacist can also give you personalized, same‑day guidance.",

    "question": "Background info: Hi I’m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I’m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I’ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor’s appointment. Thank you in advance",
    "answer": "Short answer: this most often sounds like a localized skin reaction at old IV sites (irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from the antiseptic wipe or adhesive) rather than infection or a blood clot, especially since it’s small, itchy, and right where the IVs were. It usually settles in a few days to a week.\n\nCommon causes:\n- Adhesive or dressing reaction (e.g., Tegaderm/tape)\n- Antiseptic prep reaction (chlorhexidine is a frequent culprit)\n- Mild local irritation from the IV itself\n- Less likely: cellulitis or superficial thrombophlebitis (these are typically more painful than itchy, and spread)\n\nWhat you can try at home now:\n- Cool compresses 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times/day.\n- Hydrocortisone 1% cream: thin layer to the itchy red area up to 2–3 times/day for 7–10 days.\n- Moisturize with plain petroleum jelly or a fragrance‑free lotion to reduce itch.\n- Avoid scratching; keep nails short.\n- Avoid topical antibiotic ointments like neomycin/bacitracin (they can cause allergic rashes).\n- If you want an oral antihistamine for itch: a non‑drowsy option like cetirizine 10 mg once daily or loratadine 10 mg once daily is generally preferred. Because you have epilepsy and you’re on gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine (both sedating), avoid diphenhydramine or other “PM” antihistamines, and be aware even cetirizine can add some drowsiness—take it in the evening first and don’t drive if sleepy.\n\nMonitor and seek care urgently if any of the following occur:\n- Rapidly spreading redness, warmth, increasing pain, or swelling\n- Pus, open sores, or red streaks moving up the arm\n- Fever or chills\n- The vein feels like a tender, firm cord or the whole hand/forearm swells\n- Shortness of breath or chest pain (rare but urgent)\n\nIf none of the red flags appear, it’s reasonable to treat at home and watch for 48–72 hours. If it isn’t clearly improving by then, or if it’s getting worse at any time, contact your surgeon or primary care team; a quick photo via your patient portal can help them assess.\n\nPrevention next time:\n- Let staff know you may have reacted to adhesive or chlorhexidine; they can use hypoallergenic dressings or switch to povidone‑iodine prep.\n- Ask for paper tape or silicone‑based dressings if adhesives tend to bother your skin.\n\nGiven your recent surgery and medications, if you’re unsure about taking an antihistamine, call your pharmacist or doctor for a quick check. Otherwise, the measures above are safe to try and usually help within a couple of days.",

    "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
    "answer": "Short answer first:\n- You cannot reliably “type” a dementia without imaging or labs, but you can narrow the differential clinically by mapping which cognitive domains are affected, the tempo of change, and the impact on daily function.\n- MMSE and the clock-drawing test can screen for cognitive impairment, but they are not very sensitive for mild or non-Alzheimer patterns (language/executive problems). The MoCA plus an informant questionnaire (e.g., AD8) generally outperforms MMSE for early disease.\n\nHow clinicians approach the differential clinically\n1) Establish severity and trajectory\n- Time course: insidious and steadily progressive (neurodegenerative) vs stepwise or fluctuating (vascular/Lewy body/medical).\n- Function: basic ADLs (bathing, dressing) and instrumental ADLs (meds, finances, shopping). Independent IADLs usually argues for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) rather than dementia.\n\n2) Identify the dominant cognitive domain(s)\n- Memory: difficulty learning and recalling new information; cueing helps or not?\n- Language: word-finding, fluency, grammar, repetition, naming, writing; is comprehension preserved?\n- Executive/attention: multitasking, planning, mental flexibility, processing speed.\n- Visuospatial: getting lost, judging distances, copying figures.\n- Behavior/affect: apathy, disinhibition, loss of empathy, compulsions.\n- Motor/sleep: parkinsonism, gait change, falls, REM sleep behavior disorder, myoclonus, seizures.\n\n3) Map domain patterns to common syndromes (clinical clues)\n- Alzheimer disease (amnestic presentation):\n  - Early episodic memory loss; poor delayed recall not fixed by cues; navigation difficulty.\n  - Language/executive issues come later. Usually older, but early-onset exists.\n- Primary progressive aphasia (PPA; frontotemporal spectrum; often <65):\n  - Nonfluent/agrammatic: effortful, halting speech, grammar errors; comprehension of simple sentences relatively preserved; executive deficits common.\n  - Logopenic: word-finding pauses and impaired repetition with otherwise relatively preserved grammar and single-word comprehension; often AD pathology.\n  - Semantic: loss of word meaning and single-word comprehension (less consistent with your description).\n- Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia:\n  - Early personality/behavior change, apathy/disinhibition, empathy loss; executive dysfunction; memory relatively spared early.\n- Lewy body disease:\n  - Prominent fluctuations in attention, detailed visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, parkinsonism; visuospatial deficits early; antipsychotic sensitivity.\n- Vascular cognitive impairment:\n  - Executive/processing speed deficits > memory; gait imbalance; focal neuro signs; stepwise decline or after strokes; vascular risk factors.\n- Depression-related cognitive impairment (“pseudodementia”):\n  - Prominent subjective complaints, slowed processing, impaired concentration and task-switching; “I don’t know” responses, inconsistent effort; tends to improve with mood treatment and cueing; not usually steadily progressive if mood stabilizes.\n- Other potentially reversible contributors:\n  - Sleep apnea/insomnia, pain, medications with anticholinergic burden, benzodiazepines/opioids, alcohol, thyroid/B12 deficiency, hearing/vision loss.\n\nYour description, mapped to patterns\n- Preserved comprehension with growing difficulty “transmitting information,” plus getting overwhelmed by multiple tasks, and independence in daily activities:\n  - Points toward a language-predominant and executive pattern. Consider PPA (nonfluent or logopenic variants) or an executive MCI (frontotemporal or vascular). Depression can also magnify word-finding and multitasking problems.\n  - Early-onset and language prominence make frontotemporal-spectrum disorders worth considering; logopenic PPA can be due to Alzheimer pathology.\n\nScreening tools: what they can and cannot do\n- MMSE:\n  - Quick, familiar, but relatively insensitive to MCI, executive dysfunction, and language-led syndromes; strong education/culture effects; ceiling effects in younger or highly educated people. A normal MMSE does not rule out clinically meaningful impairment.\n- Clock-drawing:\n  - Adds assessment of visuospatial and executive skills; useful but not diagnostic; education/culture can affect results.\n- Preferred brief screen in clinic:\n  - MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment): better sensitivity for MCI, executive and language deficits; cutoff ~26/30 (add 1 point for ≤12 years education).\n  - Combine with an informant tool (AD8 or IQCODE) to capture functional change.\n- If screening is positive or concern remains despite normal screening:\n  - Formal neuropsychological testing can define the cognitive profile (e.g., language vs memory vs executive), which greatly sharpens the clinical differential even before imaging.\n\nPractical next steps you can consider suggesting to her clinicians\n- Collateral history focusing on:\n  - Specific language symptoms (word-finding, grammar, repetition, writing), executive issues (planning, multitasking), day-to-day function (meds/finances/driving/safety).\n- Brief screens:\n  - MoCA + AD8 (or IQCODE), PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety.\n- Medication, sleep, sensory review:\n  - Remove anticholinergics/benzos if possible; screen for OSA; check hearing/vision.\n- Labs (reversible causes):\n  - TSH, B12 ± MMA, CBC, CMP; +/- HIV/syphilis based on risk.\n- Referrals:\n  - Neuropsychological evaluation to characterize domains.\n  - Speech-language pathology for detailed language assessment (especially if PPA is suspected).\n  - Neurology/memory clinic for comprehensive workup.\n- Imaging:\n  - Even if you aim to reason clinically, a brain MRI is very helpful to support the syndrome (e.g., focal frontal/temporal or parietal atrophy) and rule out structural causes.\n\nRed flags needing prompt evaluation\n- Rapid progression over weeks–months, new focal neurologic deficits, new gait disturbance/falls, new visual hallucinations, new seizures, severe personality/behavioral change, or headaches/systemic symptoms.\n\nBottom line\n- Clinically, a language-led and executive pattern with preserved ADLs suggests MCI with a possible PPA/frontotemporal or logopenic phenotype, versus depression-related cognitive inefficiency. MMSE + clock alone may miss this; MoCA plus informant input and neuropsych testing are better. Given her age and symptom pattern, a memory clinic/neurology referral and SLP assessment would be appropriate next steps.",

    "question": "Hi I recently had blood work done (a week ago) and my levels were high. 36yr female, I take 300mg daily of lamictal for epilepsy.Hemoglobin: 16.4 H Red blood cell count: 5.22 H Hematocrit: 47.8 H Some things I've noticed in the last 2-3 months, not sure if they are symptoms, but they have been happening enough and are different enough that I've noticed them. - night sweats, sometimes the shirt I sleep in will be wet, and it wakes me up - itchiness after hot baths or showers - fatigue (I had low vitamin D, so not sure if it's necessarily related to red blood cell count, vitamin D, or just general tiredness, i haven't been sleeping well for the past few months)",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing your results and symptoms. For a 36-year-old woman, your hemoglobin (16.4 g/dL), hematocrit (47.8%), and RBC count (5.22) are mildly elevated. One abnormal result can be from dehydration or lab variation, but the combination with night sweats and itch after hot showers (aquagenic pruritus) does warrant a proper workup.\n\nMain possibilities\n- Relative/temporary causes: dehydration, recent illness, diuretics, high altitude, smoking/vaping, carbon monoxide exposure.\n- Secondary erythrocytosis from low oxygen: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic lung/heart disease.\n- Primary bone marrow cause: polycythemia vera (PV). Aquagenic pruritus and night sweats are classic PV symptoms, though PV at your age is less common. PV often also shows high white cells or platelets (do you have those values?).\n- Lamotrigine is not known to raise red cell counts.\n\nWhat I’d ask you\n- Do you live at or recently visit high altitude?\n- Do you smoke/vape or have potential CO exposure (gas appliances, garages)?\n- Any loud snoring, witnessed apneas, morning headaches, or unrefreshing sleep (OSA signs)?\n- Any testosterone/androgen use, SGLT2 inhibitors, or diuretics?\n- Any chronic lung/heart disease?\n- Any new headaches, vision changes, dizziness, redness/flushing of face, tingling in hands/feet, abdominal fullness (left upper side), or clot history?\n- Full CBC values (white blood cells, platelets), and iron studies if available.\n\nRecommended next steps\n1) Repeat the CBC in 1–2 weeks:\n   - Go well hydrated, avoid heavy exercise and alcohol the day before.\n   - If hemoglobin ≥16.0 or hematocrit ≥48% persists, proceed with further testing.\n\n2) If still elevated, ask your clinician for:\n   - Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level.\n   - JAK2 V617F mutation test (and exon 12 if V617F negative and suspicion remains).\n   - Pulse oximetry (including overnight if OSA is suspected).\n   - Consider carboxyhemoglobin if you smoke or there’s CO exposure.\n   - Basic metabolic panel, liver panel, ferritin/iron studies; abdominal exam for spleen enlargement.\n\n3) Depending on results, your PCP may refer you to a hematologist. If PV is diagnosed, common first-line treatments are low-dose aspirin and periodic phlebotomy to lower hematocrit, with other options based on risk.\n\nSymptom relief meanwhile\n- Itch: take lukewarm (not hot) showers, pat dry, moisturize; menthol or pramoxine lotions can help; a non-drowsy antihistamine during the day may reduce itching.\n- Night sweats: keep the bedroom cool, breathable bedding, hydrate well.\n- Avoid starting iron supplements unless your clinician advises (can worsen PV-related erythrocytosis).\n- If you smoke, consider stopping.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Sudden severe headache, vision changes, weakness/numbness on one side, chest pain, shortness of breath, painful calf swelling, or confusion—these can be signs of a blood clot or other emergency.\n\nIf you can share the rest of your CBC (WBC, platelets) and any other labs, I can help interpret them and tailor next steps.",

It feels more neurological, if that makes sense.My body will feel like it's shaking on the inside, almost like it's vibrating.

Must admit, I think it's getting better as it's not as frequently happening as it was.My left nostril will drip or run snot sometimes without me even realizing it (newer symptom) My primary doctor said it's probably just post nasal drip and prescribed me nasal spray twice a day. It does help dry it out but if I miss even one time, my husband will point out it running down.Recently switched neurologist and had a EEG done which I had an episode though it showed on the test and the nurse helped me through it, it registered as not a seizure or he said it didn't convince him that it was though the nurse clearly saw it.  At times when I'm feeling off I'm rushed with rapid heart beat, shakiness, and I can't read (everything looks to be in another language). At this point I feel confused, scared, angry, and rushed. Happens a lot when I have decisions to make. Restaurants, retail store, airport, etc.I get brain fog a lot but as long as I take my nuvigil I do a lot better.Here's why I'm posting... I can hear everything while having an episode, though sometimes when I repeat back what was happening while I have a seizure it's not all the way correct. I can't talk during it. My eyes roll back. The last one I shook some, which doesn't usually happens. I've had times where my hands cripple up (rarely). I usually feel a \"drooping\" or pulling in my bottom lip when things start and a complete lack of ability to use my muscles. They feel really heavy. I tend to stare right beforehand. The second to last episode I felt a pulling sensation, like someone was turning my head towards the left. When it ended, I head was facing left.My neurologist is putting me on Vimpat.

    "answer": "Thank you for laying all of that out. You have several overlapping neurologic and autonomic issues, and some of your “episodes” could be coming from more than one process. Here’s how I’d think about it and what to do next.\n\nWhat your description suggests\n- Seizures are still possible:\n  - Head/eye pulling to the left, loss of speech during events, staring beforehand, occasional shaking, post-event inaccuracy when recalling details, and not always being able to move suggest focal seizures (often temporal or frontal). Scalp EEG can be normal if the focus is deep or brief.\n- Cataplexy can mimic seizures:\n  - Sudden loss of muscle tone with preserved awareness, often triggered by emotion, not usually followed by confusion. Your inability to talk and “heavy muscles” could be cataplexy at times.\n- Panic/overstimulation and/or dysautonomia:\n  - Episodes in stores/airports with rapid heartbeat, shakiness, fear, and “can’t read” can be panic or autonomic surges; dysautonomia can also cause the internal “vibration” feeling and tachycardia.\n- Hyperventilation-related tetany:\n  - Perioral tingling and finger/lip “stiffening” during workouts/sex are classic for hyperventilation (temporary drop in ionized calcium) and can cause carpopedal spasm.\n- Small fiber neuropathy/autonomic involvement:\n  - Fits with Raynaud’s/erythromelalgia, pins-and-needles, internal tremor, and bladder urgency.\n- Less likely but worth ruling out given urinary urgency and sensory symptoms:\n  - A central nervous system demyelinating process (e.g., MS) or cervical cord involvement, especially with sensory spells and urinary symptoms.\n\nMost useful next steps to pin this down\n- Characterize the spells definitively:\n  - Ask your neurologist for inpatient video-EEG monitoring (epilepsy monitoring unit). This is often needed when routine EEG is not convincing, especially with mixed features.\n  - If you haven’t had one recently, get a brain MRI with epilepsy protocol (and consider cervical spine MRI if there’s concern for demyelination or cord issues).\n  - Have your partner record events on a phone (start to end) and note: trigger, duration, awareness, ability to follow commands, eye/head deviation, speech, movements, incontinence, injuries, tongue biting, and how you feel afterward.\n- Screen for autonomic dysfunction/POTS:\n  - Orthostatic vitals (lying/sitting/standing HR and BP) and consider tilt-table testing if symptoms fit.\n- Check common reversible contributors to paresthesias/tremor:\n  - Labs: CBC, CMP, fasting glucose/A1c, TSH, vitamin B12 (and MMA), ferritin/iron, vitamin D, magnesium, calcium. Consider ANA and Sjögren’s antibodies if dry eyes/mouth or neuropathy features.\n- Sleep and breathing:\n  - Because snoring worsened and you stopped Xyrem: get a sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Untreated OSA can worsen seizures, cognition, daytime sleepiness, and arrhythmias.\n- Bladder:\n  - If urge incontinence persists despite constipation management, consider urology referral for urodynamics; pelvic floor therapy can help.\n\nAbout Vimpat (lacosamide)\n- Typical start is 50 mg twice daily and titrate; verify your titration plan. Common side effects: dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, imbalance. It can slow heart conduction (PR prolongation), so a baseline ECG is reasonable, especially if you’ve ever had fainting or known heart conduction issues.\n- Interactions:\n  - Armodafinil (Nuvigil) can alter some liver enzymes; a clinically important interaction with lacosamide is uncommon but watch for excess dizziness or heart symptoms.\n  - Lacosamide is not an enzyme inducer, so it should not affect your IUD. Armodafinil can reduce effectiveness of oral contraceptives, but your IUD is reliable.\n- Safety: avoid alcohol excess, keep sleep regular, don’t miss doses. Ask about a rescue med (e.g., intranasal midazolam) if you have clusters or events >3–5 minutes.\n\nNarcolepsy/cataplexy and sleep\n- If cataplexy is active, treatments include sodium oxybate/low-sodium oxybate (Xyrem/Xywav), pitolisant, or solriamfetol, plus stimulants/wake-promoting agents. Many people with OSA can still use oxybate if OSA is treated (e.g., CPAP), so the sleep study is key.\n- Keep using Nuvigil if it’s helping, but address OSA if present—this can improve daytime function and may reduce seizure risk.\n\nSymptoms that may be from dysautonomia/small-fiber neuropathy\n- Internal shaking, temperature-triggered symptoms, and blood flow issues fit. Management can include:\n  - Hydration (2–3 L/day), salt liberalization if BP allows, compression stockings, and paced, recumbent aerobic exercise.\n  - Neuropathy testing (QSART, skin biopsy) if symptoms are significant.\n- During episodes with hand/lip stiffening:\n  - Slow, diaphragmatic breathing (e.g., 4–6 breaths/min), avoid breath-holding and rapid over-breathing, and consider checking magnesium/calcium.\n\nUnilateral runny nostril\n- Most often nonallergic/vasomotor rhinitis. Ipratropium nasal spray is particularly good for watery rhinorrhea.\n- Red flags for CSF leak: persistent clear, watery drainage from one side, salty/metallic taste, worse when bending forward, new positional headaches. If those fit, ask ENT for beta-2 transferrin testing.\n\nBladder/bowel\n- Aggressive constipation management (daily osmotic laxative like polyethylene glycol, fiber, fluids) to reduce urge symptoms.\n- Pelvic floor physical therapy and bladder training often help; rule out UTI if symptoms fluctuate.\n\nLifestyle and safety\n- Avoid overheating; pre-cool before workouts, hydrate, take breaks. Consider that over-breathing may be triggering the spasms—focus on nasal, slow breathing during exertion and sex.\n- Do not drive or operate dangerous equipment if you’re having events with impaired awareness; follow your state’s seizure-free driving laws.\n- Call EMS if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, if you have repeated seizures without recovery, bad injury, new focal weakness, or a severe worst-ever headache.\n\nQuestions to discuss with your neurologist/sleep doctor\n- Can we arrange inpatient video-EEG monitoring to capture events?\n- Do I need a brain MRI (epilepsy protocol) and possibly cervical spine MRI?\n- Baseline ECG before/after starting lacosamide?\n- Rescue medication for prolonged clusters?\n- Sleep study for OSA, and if positive, can we revisit low-sodium oxybate or alternatives for cataplexy?\n- Should we evaluate for dysautonomia/POTS and small-fiber neuropathy?\n- Which labs to run for neuropathy and metabolic contributors?\n\nA few clarifying questions for you\n- Are some attacks clearly triggered by laughter, surprise, or strong emotions (suggesting cataplexy)? Do those episodes have no confusion afterward?\n- During the episodes your husband witnesses, how long do they last, and do you bite your tongue or lose bladder control? How long is the recovery?\n- When was your last brain MRI? Any history of optic symptoms or electric-shock sensations with neck movement?\n- Is the unilateral nasal drainage clear and salty, and worse when you bend forward? Any new positional headaches?\n- Have you ever had orthostatic vitals checked (HR jump ≥30 bpm when standing)?\n\nIf you share those details, I can help fine-tune the next steps.",

    "question": "An MRI with Neuroquant showed these normative percentiles: Hippocampal Occupancy Score – 32 Hippocampi – 72 Superior Lateral Ventricles – 94 Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74 The hippocampal volume seems normal but the hippocampal occupancy score is very low. What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward. My information: 24F, 110 pounds, conditions: epilepsy, history of COVID, history of vaccine reaction, medications: Trileptal, location of problem: brain, duration: 9 months",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- Your hippocampal volume (72nd percentile) is normal for age.\n- Your ventricles are on the larger side of normal (superior lateral 94th, inferior/temporal horns 74th).\n- The low Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOC 32nd percentile) usually means there is relatively more cerebrospinal fluid space around the hippocampus (prominent temporal horns) compared with hippocampal tissue. In young adults this often reflects normal variation or measurement factors, not disease—especially when the hippocampal volume itself is normal.\n- Prognosis for post‑COVID “brain fog,” memory issues, and depersonalization is generally favorable over months to a couple of years, especially with targeted treatment and when MRI does not show clear injury. Your epilepsy and medications can also contribute to cognitive symptoms and are important to optimize.\n\nWhat HOC means in context\n- NeuroQuant HOC is a ratio: hippocampus volume relative to the adjacent inferior lateral ventricle (temporal horn). A lower score can be seen with:\n  - Enlarged temporal horns (more CSF space) even if the hippocampus volume is normal.\n  - Normal anatomic variation, small head size, or segmentation/motion artifacts.\n  - True mesial temporal/hippocampal atrophy (which typically also shows reduced hippocampal volume and/or signal changes).\n- In your case, hippocampi = 72 (normal-high) and inferior lateral ventricles = 74 (slightly large) → the ratio can look lower (HOC 32) because the ventricle is relatively prominent. That does not by itself prove hippocampal injury.\n- These metrics are most validated for older adults (e.g., Alzheimer’s screening). In a 24‑year‑old, they are less specific and must be interpreted with the images and clinical exam.\n\nOther factors that can explain your symptoms\n- Post‑acute sequelae of COVID (“long COVID”) commonly causes memory, attention, dissociation/depersonalization, anxiety/depression, sleep disturbance, and autonomic symptoms; structural MRI is often normal.\n- Epilepsy itself (and subclinical seizures) can impair memory. Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) can cause cognitive slowing and mood changes; hyponatremia from oxcarbazepine can cause confusion and “brain fog.”\n- Depression and anxiety can produce significant, reversible memory problems (“pseudodementia”).\n- Poor sleep, nutritional deficits (B12, folate, iron), thyroid issues, and medications/substances also contribute.\n- Prior CBD oil is unlikely to cause lasting structural change; the depersonalization it triggered is usually functional and reversible.\n\nPrognosis\n- With normal hippocampal volume and no clear MRI evidence of limbic injury, the outlook is generally good. Many people improve substantially over 6–18 months with management of seizures, mood, sleep, and rehabilitation strategies.\n- If cognitive problems are driven by depression/anxiety, sleep, medication side effects, or long‑COVID dysautonomia, improvement is very likely with targeted care.\n- If there were ongoing seizures or true mesial temporal sclerosis, prognosis depends on seizure control; your current volumes do not suggest clear hippocampal atrophy.\n\nWhat I would do next\n- Ask a neurologist (ideally an epilepsy specialist) to:\n  - Review the actual MRI images (not just the NeuroQuant numbers) for hippocampal signal changes, asymmetry, and temporal horn morphology; consider a dedicated 3T epilepsy protocol if not already done.\n  - Check for unilateral differences; NeuroQuant can report left/right hippocampal volumes and HOC per side.\n  - Consider EEG (including sleep or prolonged/ambulatory) to rule out subclinical seizures contributing to memory issues.\n- Labs: CMP (especially sodium), CBC, TSH, B12, folate, vitamin D, iron studies; consider inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP). If symptoms were abrupt/severe or progressive with psychiatric features and movement/autonomic changes, discuss an autoimmune encephalitis workup.\n- Medication review: Evaluate oxcarbazepine dose, side effects, and serum sodium; consider alternatives if cognitive/mood effects are prominent.\n- Neuropsychological testing to map your memory/attention profile and guide cognitive rehab.\n- Address long‑COVID contributors: sleep optimization, graded activity/pacing, hydration, treatment of anxiety/depression and depersonalization (CBT/trauma‑informed therapy; medications as appropriate and seizure‑safe). A long‑COVID clinic can help if available.\n\nRed flags needing urgent care\n- New or worsening seizures, severe headache, fever/neck stiffness, rapidly progressive confusion, new neurologic deficits, psychosis, or suicidal thoughts.\n\nBottom line\nYour NeuroQuant profile mainly shows relatively prominent ventricles with normal hippocampal size, which often reflects normal variation in someone your age. It does not, by itself, indicate hippocampal damage. Given your symptoms and epilepsy, the priority is careful neurologic review of the images, seizure assessment, lab screening (including sodium), and comprehensive management of mood/sleep/long‑COVID factors. The chance of improvement is good.",

    "question": "I have epilepsy(taking Keppra/Lamictal)Age: 39M Height: 6’0 Weight: 235 Non smoker/drinker I have epilepsy(controlled by meds) and have typically avoided flu vaccines due to GBS(albeit rare). Has anyone heard of any data related to the Covid vaccine and GBS and/or is there a better choice when choosing between brands.",
    "answer": "Short answer: If you’re concerned about Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), the safest choice among COVID-19 vaccines is an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna). Large safety systems have not found an increased GBS risk with mRNA vaccines. An increased GBS risk signal was seen with the adenoviral-vector vaccines (J&J/Janssen and AstraZeneca), which are no longer used in the U.S. Novavax (protein subunit) has not shown a consistent GBS signal, but the safety database is smaller than for mRNA, so mRNA remains the preferred option.\n\nDetails and context:\n- GBS and COVID vaccines:\n  - mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna): No increased risk of GBS detected across multiple large studies and CDC/ACIP monitoring.\n  - Adenoviral-vector vaccines (J&J/Janssen, AstraZeneca): A clear increased GBS signal was observed; J&J is no longer available in the U.S.\n  - Novavax: No clear GBS signal to date, but less real-world data than mRNA.\n  - COVID-19 infection itself is associated with a higher risk of GBS than mRNA vaccination.\n\n- If you’ve previously had GBS:\n  - Especially if it occurred within 6 weeks of a vaccination, most guidelines prefer an mRNA COVID vaccine and advise avoiding adenoviral-vector vaccines. Shared decision-making with your clinician is recommended.\n  - If you’ve never had GBS and simply worry about it, mRNA vaccines are still the top choice.\n\n- Epilepsy (on Keppra and Lamictal):\n  - These medications do not interact with COVID vaccines.\n  - Vaccination is considered safe for people with epilepsy. The main issue is that fever or poor sleep after any vaccine can transiently lower seizure threshold.\n  - Practical tips: stay well rested and hydrated, consider acetaminophen/ibuprofen if you develop fever or significant aches, and keep your seizure meds on schedule.\n\n- Brand choice between mRNA vaccines:\n  - For a 39-year-old male, either Pfizer or Moderna is appropriate. Myocarditis risk after mRNA vaccines is very low at your age; if you want to minimize it further, some prefer Pfizer (slightly lower myocarditis signal in younger males), but the difference at 39 is small.\n\n- Your overall risk-benefit:\n  - At 6'0\" and 235 lb (BMI ~32), you have a higher baseline risk for severe COVID. The protection from vaccination strongly outweighs the very small risks noted above.\n\nIf you’re open to it, two quick clarifiers can fine-tune advice:\n1) Have you ever been diagnosed with GBS, particularly within 6 weeks of any vaccine or infection?\n2) When was your last COVID vaccine or infection?\n\nI’m happy to tailor specific brand and timing recommendations based on that.",

    "question": "About June of 22 I suffered an event which felt like a lightning bolt across my chest not soon after starting experiencing numbness in arms and legs, constant bouts of extreme fatigue and muscle spasms/ cramps…neurology ruled out epilepsy and PNES, they are still stumped on ms or lyme possibly…the only confusing part is reoccurring rhabdomyolysis and extreme heat intolerance…the numbness has turned into more of a burning feeling down arms and legs and seems to be spreading used to only start in finger tips and toes…the muscle spasms in legs seems to be getting worse…neuro could only find. Low testosterone symptoms, was referred to endocrinologist and put on test replacement…exercise and diet seem to help temporarily but then I hit the reoccurring course of over heating and then my CK levels spike was at 16000 recently but after aggresive flushing they went back down, we’re kind of at a cross road was wondering if anyone had insight on what to do next? Neurology only wants to repeat an mri once per year to rule out ms",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’ve been dealing with all of this. The combination of recurrent rhabdomyolysis (CK up to 16,000), heat intolerance, worsening muscle cramps/spasms, and burning/numbness in the limbs is not well explained by MS or Lyme alone. MS does not cause rhabdomyolysis, and Lyme rarely does. Your story warrants a focused evaluation for muscle (myopathic) and autonomic/small fiber nerve causes, not just repeat brain MRIs.\n\nConditions to consider (to discuss with your clinicians)\n- Exertional/heat-related rhabdomyolysis with an underlying muscle susceptibility:\n  - RYR1-related malignant hyperthermia susceptibility/exertional rhabdo (often provoked by heat/exertion; important anesthesia implications).\n  - Fatty acid oxidation defects (e.g., CPT2 deficiency) – episodes triggered by prolonged exercise, fasting, illness, sometimes heat.\n  - Glycogen storage myopathies (e.g., McArdle disease/PYGM) – exercise intolerance, cramps; ask yourself if you get a “second wind” after 8–10 minutes of gentle activity.\n  - Mitochondrial myopathies.\n  - Sickle cell trait can predispose to exertional rhabdo.\n- Inflammatory/immune myopathies (e.g., anti-HMGCR if there’s statin exposure, anti-SRP) – can cause high CK, cramps/weakness.\n- Endocrine/metabolic contributors: thyroid (hyper or hypo), parathyroid/calcium/phosphate, adrenal issues, electrolytes (K, Mg), vitamin D deficiency. Low testosterone alone wouldn’t explain recurrent rhabdo.\n- Small fiber neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction (can cause burning pain and heat intolerance). These can coexist with a myopathy.\n\nWhat to ask for next\nAsk your primary care clinician to refer you to:\n- A neuromuscular specialist (neurology with a myopathy focus) or a metabolic myopathy clinic at a tertiary center.\n- Consider autonomic testing (for heat intolerance) and small fiber neuropathy evaluation.\n\nTesting that’s reasonable to discuss\nBaseline (between episodes):\n- CK (to see if persistently elevated), aldolase, AST/ALT, LDH, CMP (renal, electrolytes), magnesium, phosphate; urinalysis for myoglobin.\n- Thyroid panel (TSH, free T4), calcium, PTH, fasting glucose/A1c, morning cortisol; vitamin D, B12/folate.\n- ESR/CRP, ANA.\n- Medication/supplement review (statins, fibrates, antipsychotics, stimulants, alcohol, cocaine, herbal products).\n- Hemoglobin electrophoresis (sickle cell trait).\n\nMyopathy-focused:\n- Myositis antibody panel including anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP.\n- Acylcarnitine profile and total/free carnitine (fatty acid oxidation defects).\n- Non-ischemic forearm exercise test (for McArdle).\n- EMG/NCS and MRI of thigh/calf muscles to look for myopathic pattern or inflammation.\n- If suggested by results, genetic panel for exertional rhabdo/metabolic myopathy (e.g., RYR1, CPT2, PYGM, PFKM, TANGO2, LPIN1, mitochondrial genes).\n- Muscle biopsy guided by imaging, if needed.\n\nAutonomic/small fiber evaluation:\n- Autonomic reflex screen (tilt table for POTS/heat intolerance), QSART/sweat testing.\n- Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density if burning pain persists.\n\nSafety and day-to-day steps now\n- Prevent rhabdo: keep well hydrated, avoid heat and saunas/hot tubs, schedule activity in cool environments, use cooling vests/ice towels, and take frequent rest/cooling breaks.\n- Avoid fasting; consider a carb-containing snack before activity; avoid sudden high-intensity or eccentric exercise; favor gentle, graded aerobic activity. Stop immediately if severe cramps, weakness, or dark urine.\n- During an episode: aggressive oral fluids; seek urgent care/ER for dark cola-colored urine, severe muscle pain/swelling, reduced urination, chest pain, confusion, or if CK is >5,000 and rising.\n- Medication cautions: avoid alcohol/binge drinking and stimulants; review any statin/fibrate use with your doctor.\n- Anesthesia warning: until RYR1-related susceptibility is ruled out, tell any anesthesiologist to avoid volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine; consider a medical alert bracelet.\n- Monitor testosterone therapy: ensure hematocrit/hemoglobin are checked regularly; TRT is unlikely to be the cause of rhabdo but discuss dosing/targets.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Recurrent heat/exertion-triggered rhabdomyolysis strongly suggests an underlying, potentially diagnosable muscle/metabolic condition. These are often missed unless a neuromuscular specialist looks specifically for them.\n- The burning pain and heat intolerance point toward small fiber/autonomic involvement, which can be evaluated and sometimes treated.\n\nUseful questions to bring to your next visit\n- Could this be an exertional/metabolic myopathy (RYR1, CPT2, McArdle)? Can we order an acylcarnitine profile and a genetic panel?\n- Should we do EMG, muscle MRI, and a myositis antibody panel (including anti-HMGCR, anti-SRP)?\n- Can I be referred for autonomic testing and a small fiber skin biopsy?\n- Is there any reason to suspect sickle cell trait, and can we check for it?\n- What is my baseline CK between episodes, and does that change our differential?\n\nIf you share your age, medications/supplements, any statin use, family history of anesthesia problems or rhabdomyolysis, whether you notice a “second wind,” and whether episodes follow fasting/illness, I can help tailor this further.",

    "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I ‘woke up’ I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you describe is frightening and disorienting, and the shame you feel is a very common reaction after a first seizure. None of this is your fault.\n\nIs it epilepsy or fainting (vasovagal syncope)?\n- Several details you shared fit epileptic generalized tonic–clonic seizures:\n  - Sudden collapse with full-body jerking reported by a witness.\n  - Post‑ictal agitation/confusion and amnesia (not remembering what happened, “brain lag” for 20–30 seconds or longer).\n  - A seizure during sleep (vasovagal syncope basically never happens while asleep).\n- Vasovagal syncope usually has a warning (nausea, lightheadedness, tunnel vision), occurs when standing, and recovery is quick with clear memory afterward. It can cause brief jerks, but prolonged confusion and events out of sleep are uncommon.\n- Two unprovoked events separated in time meet the standard medical definition of epilepsy. That’s why treatment was started.\n\nPlease don’t stop lamotrigine on your own\n- Stopping suddenly raises your risk of more and worse seizures, injury, and (rarely) SUDEP. If you and your neurologist later decide to come off medication, it must be a slow, supervised taper.\n- Many people stay on medicine until they’ve been seizure‑free for a period (often 2+ years) and have reassuring EEG/MRI results, but this is individualized.\n\nAbout lamotrigine and memory\n- Lamotrigine is one of the more “cognitively friendly” anti‑seizure medicines, but some people feel brain fog or memory issues during titration. These often improve after a few weeks at a stable dose.\n- Practical tips:\n  - Prioritize good sleep; sleep loss strongly worsens both seizures and memory.\n  - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.\n  - Stay hydrated, eat regularly.\n  - Track side effects in a diary for your doctor.\n- If memory problems remain bothersome after a few weeks at your current dose, ask your neurologist about:\n  - Slowing the titration or adjusting timing (e.g., more at night).\n  - Checking for other contributors (low mood/anxiety, sleep quality, thyroid/B12/iron).\n  - Considering an alternative medication if needed. There are several options; each has its own side‑effect profile.\n\nRecommended evaluation (if not already done)\n- EEG (ideally with sleep deprivation or ambulatory EEG if standard EEG is normal).\n- Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol.\n- Basic labs (glucose, electrolytes) and an ECG (to screen for cardiac causes if any doubt).\n- Keep a seizure diary noting date/time, sleep, stress, illness, alcohol, missed doses, and what witnesses observed.\n\nSafety steps now\n- Driving: most places require a seizure‑free period before driving. Check Hong Kong’s rules and follow your doctor’s advice.\n- Water/heights: no swimming alone or bathing in a tub; take showers with the door unlocked. Avoid climbing heights, open flames, and operating heavy machinery.\n- Share a simple seizure first‑aid plan with at least one trusted person (even if you prefer privacy).\n- Set reliable medication reminders; missed doses are a common cause of breakthrough seizures.\n- Consider a medical ID bracelet or phone Medical ID.\n\nSeizure first aid (for friends/family to know)\n- Time the seizure. Protect your head, turn you on your side, don’t put anything in your mouth, don’t restrain.\n- Call emergency services if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, there are repeated seizures without full recovery, there’s injury, breathing problems, it happens in water, or it’s a first seizure.\n\nHow to move forward\n- Book follow‑up with a neurologist/epilepsy clinic to:\n  - Review your EEG/MRI results and the specific seizure type.\n  - Discuss your memory symptoms and options to manage them.\n  - Clarify activity/driving restrictions and a plan for how long to stay on medication.\n- It might help to tell one trusted friend or family member so you have support and someone who knows seizure first aid.\n- Local support can be valuable; ask your hospital’s Patient Resource Centre about epilepsy support groups in Hong Kong.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- What tests (EEG/MRI) you’ve had and the results.\n- Any side effects besides memory issues.\n- Whether anyone noticed tongue biting (especially on the side), incontinence, or how long the confusion lasted—these details can further support the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n\nYou’re doing the right thing by seeking help and information. With the right plan, most people with epilepsy lead full, independent lives.",

    "question": "24 F USA Asthma, epilepsy, hypothyroidismI have laryngeal candidiasis (unknown cause but thought to be from Breo and prednisone?) and it isn't responding much to fluconazole. The next step is amphotericin b and I'm kinda nervous. What should I expect realistically?",
    "answer": "Short answer: amphotericin B can work when fluconazole doesn’t, but what you’ll experience depends a lot on the route (inhaled/topical vs IV). Be sure to ask your clinician which form they plan to use.\n\nWhy fluconazole may not have worked\n- Wrong species or resistance: Candida glabrata or krusei are often less responsive to fluconazole.\n- Ongoing triggers: inhaled steroids (Breo), recent prednisone, reflux, recent antibiotics, diabetes, or suboptimal inhaler technique.\n- Incomplete penetration to the larynx or insufficient dose/duration.\n\nBefore stepping up, it’s reasonable to confirm:\n- Laryngeal swab/biopsy for speciation and susceptibility testing.\n- Review inhaler technique and consider changes to asthma meds to reduce steroid deposition on the larynx.\n- Screen for contributing factors (reflux control, blood glucose if risks, etc.).\n\nWhat amphotericin B could look like\n\n1) Nebulized/inhaled amphotericin B (often used for airway/laryngeal disease)\n- What to expect: bitter taste, throat irritation, cough; sometimes bronchospasm/wheezing.\n- How they minimize issues: pretreatment with an albuterol inhaler, slow nebulization, possibly a lower starting dose.\n- Systemic side effects: usually minimal because absorption is low.\n- Monitoring: usually fewer blood tests; report new/worsening wheeze, chest tightness, or shortness of breath.\n\n2) IV amphotericin B (often liposomal “AmBisome” to reduce toxicity)\n- Why chosen: severe or refractory disease, resistant species, or when azoles/echinocandins aren’t suitable.\n- What the infusion is like: typically daily infusions over ~1–2 hours at an infusion center for about 7–14 days (varies).\n- Common infusion reactions (especially first doses): fever, chills/rigors, headache, nausea, back/chest pain. Premedication (acetaminophen, diphenhydramine; sometimes meperidine for rigors) helps.\n- Kidney and electrolyte effects: can raise creatinine and waste potassium and magnesium. You may get saline before/after infusions and oral/IV K/Mg supplements.\n- Monitoring: baseline and at least twice-weekly labs (kidney function, potassium, magnesium). Call if you notice low urine output, severe muscle cramps/weakness, palpitations, or lightheadedness.\n- Other: anemia can develop with longer courses; IV site irritation can occur.\n- Liposomal formulations are much kinder to kidneys than conventional amphotericin B.\n\nOther options you can ask about\n- Azoles with better activity in some resistant cases: itraconazole solution, posaconazole, or voriconazole (but these can interact with some anti-seizure meds).\n- Echinocandins (micafungin, caspofungin, anidulafungin) given IV—often well tolerated with minimal kidney toxicity; sometimes used for refractory mucosal candidiasis.\n\nAsthma/steroid steps to reduce recurrence\n- Rinse, gargle, and spit after each Breo dose; brush teeth/tongue.\n- Consider switching from a dry-powder inhaler to an MDI inhaler with a spacer, or to ciclesonide (less oropharyngeal deposition), if your asthma team agrees.\n- Use the lowest effective inhaled steroid dose; minimize courses of prednisone when possible.\n- Treat reflux aggressively if present; avoid smoking/vaping; good oral hygiene.\n\nGood questions to ask your team\n- Which amphotericin B route and formulation are you planning (nebulized vs IV, liposomal vs conventional)? For how long?\n- Do we have culture/speciation and susceptibility results yet?\n- What is the monitoring plan (labs, frequency)? Will I receive premeds and hydration?\n- Given my epilepsy meds, are azoles or echinocandins viable alternatives?\n- What changes can we make to my inhaler choice/technique to prevent recurrence?\n\nIf you tell me which route they’re proposing and what anti-seizure medication you’re on, I can outline a more specific “what to expect” plan and interaction considerations.",

It does help, but it doesn't cure my state.I'm smoking tobacco on a daily basis, drink alcohol sometimes, smoking cannabis on weekends, and very rarely I take LSD in moderate dosages.As of yet I didn't get a real Diagnose, so I wanted to ask the reddit community, because why not giving it a shot right?I really hope someone can help me, mostly because I don't want to cause any more trouble and anxiety to my girlfriend.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you and your partner are dealing with this—nighttime events can be scary, and it’s frustrating not to have a clear diagnosis yet. What you describe sounds very consistent with nocturnal seizures, but there are a few different possibilities that can look similar at night. The good news is there are tests that can usually sort this out, and there are ways to reduce risk and improve control.\n\nWhat this could be\n- Nocturnal epileptic seizures (for example, focal seizures that spread, sleep-related hypermotor/frontal lobe seizures, or generalized tonic–clonic seizures during sleep). Features that fit: no memory of the event, abnormal sounds, breathing changes, and that your partner is the only witness.\n- Parasomnias (like REM sleep behavior disorder or night terrors). These often include complex movements and sounds too, but people often have dream recall with REM behavior disorder, and the pattern and movements are different on sleep testing.\n- Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with gasping/choking and jerks can mimic events; OSA also increases seizure risk and makes seizures harder to control.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Uncontrolled nocturnal generalized seizures are a risk factor for SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). Don’t panic—the absolute risk is low—but it’s a reason to push for a firm diagnosis and good control, and to use sensible night-time safety measures.\n\nWhat to do next (diagnostics)\n- Ask your neurologist for an inpatient or ambulatory video-EEG capture. Best is overnight video-EEG monitoring in an epilepsy unit—ideally combined with a full polysomnogram (sleep study) with an expanded EEG montage. This can distinguish seizures from parasomnias and check for sleep apnea at the same time.\n- Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol (if you haven’t had one) to look for structural causes.\n- Basic labs (electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium) if not recently checked.\n- If snoring, witnessed apneas, or daytime sleepiness: formal sleep study even if your EEG is still pending.\n\nMedication points\n- Levetiracetam is a standard antiseizure medication. Many people need twice-daily dosing unless you’re on an extended-release version; confirm with your neurologist that your dosing and timing are optimal for nocturnal events.\n- If events continue, your neurologist may consider switching or adding a different antiseizure medicine. Some sleep-related hypermotor/frontal lobe seizures respond well to carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine, for example. This is individualized—work with an epileptologist if you can.\n- Keep a strict medication schedule; missing doses is a common reason for breakthrough seizures.\n\nSubstances and triggers\n- Alcohol (especially evening or heavy use) and sleep deprivation lower seizure threshold and worsen nighttime events. Try to avoid or minimize alcohol until this is controlled.\n- Cannabis can also disrupt sleep architecture and, in some, worsen seizures. If you choose to continue, keep doses low and avoid strong THC before bed.\n- LSD and other psychedelics are unpredictable in this context and can disturb sleep; best to avoid until you have a firm diagnosis and good control.\n- Tobacco: quitting is good for overall health and sleep quality. If you try medication aids, avoid bupropion (it can lower seizure threshold); varenicline or nicotine replacement may be safer—discuss with your doctor.\n\nSafety and first aid at night\n- Your partner should know seizure first aid: turn you on your side, cushion the head, do not put anything in the mouth, time the event, call emergency services if it lasts >5 minutes, if there are repeated seizures without full recovery, or if you’re injured or have trouble breathing after the event.\n- Make the sleep environment safer: low bed or floor mattress, remove sharp edges nearby, don’t sleep alone if possible while uncontrolled, consider side-sleeping, and avoid locking the bedroom door.\n- Consider a seizure-detection device (wearable or bed sensor) to alert your partner.\n- If your girlfriend notices loud snoring, long breathing pauses, or severe gasping, that increases the likelihood of sleep apnea—treating OSA can significantly reduce seizures.\n\nTracking and clues that help your doctors\n- Ask your partner to record an event on video (if safe) and note:\n  - Time of night, duration, body position (on back/side), stiffening vs rhythmic jerks, head/eye deviation, skin color changes, breathing pattern, sounds, tongue biting (especially the sides of the tongue), incontinence, and how you are after (confused, sleepy, sore muscles, headache).\n- Keep a log of triggers: missed meds, alcohol, cannabis, stress, sleep loss.\n\nDriving/work and legal\n- Depending on your location, nocturnal seizures can still affect driving clearance. Ask your neurologist about local rules and safety for work at heights, with machinery, or in water.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, significant injury, or new neurologic symptoms (weakness, bad headache, fever, confusion).\n\nQuestions to discuss with your neurologist\n- Can we arrange overnight video-EEG with polysomnography?\n- Have I had an epilepsy-protocol MRI?\n- Is my levetiracetam dose/formulation optimal for nocturnal events? If not fully controlled, what’s the next medication step?\n- Should I be screened/treated for sleep apnea?\n- Do I need a rescue medication plan (e.g., intranasal midazolam) for prolonged events?\n\nIf you share a bit more detail—how often this happens, typical duration, any tongue biting/incontinence, snoring or witnessed apneas, and your current levetiracetam dose/formulation—I can help you think through the next steps more specifically.",

    "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",
    "answer": "What you describe is very consistent with vasovagal syncope with convulsive movements (“convulsive syncope”) triggered by blood/needle procedures and high anxiety. It can look very seizure‑like: tunnel vision/“light going away,” roaring/hammering sound, brief loss of consciousness, and short, irregular jerks or kicking. Skin can appear pale or even bluish/purplish briefly because blood pressure drops and breathing may pause. That said, it’s important to keep ruling out other causes (true epileptic seizures, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, or cardiac syncope).\n\nWhat to check with his clinicians\n- Ask for a clear working diagnosis. Given the trigger pattern since adolescence and normal epilepsy work‑ups, vasovagal syncope is likely. If doubt remains, a neurologist can consider video‑EEG monitoring to rule out epilepsy; a tilt‑table test can confirm vasovagal syncope; an ECG +/- ambulatory monitor screens for rhythm problems.\n- Red flags needing cardiology input: fainting during exercise, while lying down, with palpitations or chest pain, a family history of sudden cardiac death, or prolonged confusion after events.\n\nPractical first aid during an episode\n- At the first warning (dizziness, tunnel vision, nausea, “sound fading”): have him lie flat immediately and elevate his legs; loosen tight clothing.\n- Do not restrain movements or put anything in his mouth. Protect his head from injury.\n- Check breathing. If he isn’t breathing or you can’t find a pulse, call emergency services and start CPR. Call if loss of consciousness lasts longer than about 1–2 minutes, if he’s injured, or if color doesn’t return promptly.\n- Expect quick orientation on waking; allow him to rest, hydrate, and have a salty snack if advised by his clinician.\n\nHow to reduce or prevent events (especially around needles/procedures)\n- Tell staff in advance: “I have vasovagal syncope with jerking when I get needles.” Ask to be kept lying down for the entire procedure and a few minutes afterward.\n- Hydrate well the day before and day of; a light salty snack beforehand if allowed.\n- Use applied tension (key for blood/injection phobia):\n  - Repeatedly tense legs, buttocks, and core hard for ~10–15 seconds (until you feel warmth in your face), then relax ~20–30 seconds. Start a couple of minutes before the needle and continue during it. Practice daily so it’s automatic.\n- Consider comfort measures: topical anesthetic cream (e.g., lidocaine/prilocaine) applied beforehand, small‑gauge needles, distraction/VR, and a calm, step‑by‑step explanation.\n- Medication options for the procedure: a short‑acting benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam) can help anxiety but should be used carefully because it can lower blood pressure; this should be planned with the clinician. Avoid propranolol for this specific phobia if he tends to faint, as it can blunt heart‑rate compensation.\n\nTherapy that tends to work best\n- For blood/injection phobia: exposure‑based CBT that includes applied tension. It should be a graded plan (images → videos → being in a clinic → holding a needle → mock procedure → real procedure), with you practicing applied tension throughout. Many general CBT courses miss this “applied tension + graded exposure” piece.\n- For panic disorder: CBT with interoceptive exposure and/or an SSRI/SNRI if symptoms persist. Benzodiazepines can be useful short‑term but aren’t good long‑term solutions.\n\nWhat would help his doctors (and you)\n- Keep a brief event log: trigger, prodrome symptoms, whether he was standing/sitting, duration of unconsciousness, movements, color change, injuries, and how quickly he was oriented afterward. A safe video of an event can be very helpful diagnostically.\n\nA note on the hospital medication: it was likely a benzodiazepine (like lorazepam), not an opioid, to calm him for testing.\n\nIf you can share: about how long he’s unconscious, how quickly he’s clear‑headed afterward, whether he’s ever fainted without a medical/needle trigger, and whether there’s any family history of fainting or heart rhythm problems—those details can help fine‑tune recommendations.",

    "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn’t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I’ve never experienced this before.I’m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5’3, weight: 109 lbs",
    "answer": "Short answer: What you’re describing most often fits a benign sleep-onset phenomenon (hypnic jerks/sleep-onset myoclonus) and/or a medication-effect “brain zap,” especially after a period of inconsistent dosing that’s recently become regular again. It’s reasonable to rule out other causes with your doctor’s MRI order, but in the absence of other neurologic symptoms, this usually isn’t dangerous.\n\nDetails:\n- Common/benign possibilities\n  - Sleep-onset myoclonus (hypnic “jerks”): brief shock-like sensation and body jolt right as you’re drifting off. Can feel like an electrical wave. Often worsened by stress, sleep deprivation, caffeine, and stimulating meds.\n  - “Brain zaps” related to antidepressant-class meds: Electric-shock sensations can happen with dose changes, missed doses, or reinstating regular dosing of drugs affecting serotonin/norepinephrine. Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; while less classic than SSRIs/SNRIs, similar sensations have been reported, especially with inconsistent dosing or interactions that alter blood levels.\n  - Anxiety/hyperventilation at sleep onset can cause brief perioral/tongue tingling.\n\n- Less likely but important to consider\n  - Focal sensory seizures: usually recurrent, stereotyped, may spread (“march”) and aren’t limited to sleep onset; can include altered awareness or tongue biting. Your history of non-epileptic seizures makes this trickier to sort out, so if events start occurring when fully awake, last longer, or change character, a neurologic workup (including EEG) is appropriate.\n  - Other neurologic disease is less likely when symptoms last seconds and occur only at sleep onset, but your clinician is appropriately being cautious with an MRI.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Keep the MRI appointment. If symptoms persist or change, ask about a sleep-deprived EEG or referral to neurology.\n- Review all meds/supplements with your prescriber:\n  - Confirm your atomoxetine dose and timing (morning dosing is usually better for sleep).\n  - Note any recent missed doses, late doses, or restarts.\n  - List other meds that can interact and raise atomoxetine levels or lower seizure threshold (examples: fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, duloxetine, venlafaxine, tramadol, dextromethorphan, some antihistamines). If you started or changed any of these recently, tell your doctor.\n  - Don’t stop atomoxetine abruptly—speak with your prescriber if a change is needed.\n- Optimize sleep and reduce triggers for a couple of weeks:\n  - Consistent sleep schedule; no caffeine/energy drinks after noon; limit alcohol/cannabis; good wind-down routine.\n  - Hydration; consider reducing evening screen time; manage stress.\n- Track episodes: time, what you were doing, dose timing that day, caffeine/alcohol, and whether it only happens at sleep onset.\n\nSeek urgent care now if you develop any of the following:\n- Episodes during the day with loss of awareness, tongue biting, incontinence, or confusion afterward.\n- Persistent numbness/weakness on one side, trouble speaking, vision loss, severe sudden headache, fainting, chest pain, or a prolonged episode lasting more than a few minutes.\n- Rapidly worsening frequency or severity.\n\nIf these remain brief, only at the moment of falling asleep, and you’re otherwise well, it’s likely benign and may settle as your medication levels and sleep stabilize over 1–3 weeks. If it doesn’t improve or you’re worried, a neurology visit is reasonable.\n\nIf you can, share:\n- Your exact atomoxetine dose and when you take it\n- Any other meds/supplements\n- Caffeine/alcohol/nicotine use\n- Whether the tongue numbness is one-sided or both, and how long it lasts\n- Whether anyone has witnessed a body jerk or if there’s any loss of awareness",

    "question": "Age 23 Sex M Hypertension, Hypothyroid, pre-diabetes, ADHD, Anxiety Disorder and panic attacksOkay so my MRI's report is normal, here:https://imgur.com/a/OiCEZ3N I get these body jerks so the doctor was thinking it's Myoclonic Epilepsy or Motor Tics. But the Motor Tics medicine isn't doing any good to me so the doc was thinking about Myoclonic Epilepsy. But my MRI report is fine? Do i still need to worry? I have ADHD, Panic attacks and Anxiety Disorder problems and even normal MRI is killing me inside why am i having those jerks!?",
    "answer": "I’m glad your MRI is normal—that’s reassuring. It also doesn’t rule out the reasons you’re having jerks. An MRI looks at brain structure; many conditions that cause body jerks (including several epilepsies and tics) have a completely normal MRI. What you need next is testing that looks at brain activity and a careful review of triggers and medications.\n\nCommon possibilities at your age\n- Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME): brief, shock-like jerks (often of shoulders/arms) soon after waking; worsened by sleep deprivation, alcohol, stress, or flashing lights. MRI is usually normal. EEG often shows generalized polyspike-wave discharges.\n- Motor tics: usually semi-voluntary, often preceded by an “urge,” can sometimes be briefly suppressed, may come in patterns. Anxiety and stimulants can worsen them.\n- Benign “sleep starts” (hypnic jerks): single jerks as you fall asleep—common and harmless.\n- Anxiety/startle-related myoclonus: stress and panic can increase sudden startle-type jerks.\n- Medication/substance effects: stimulants for ADHD, bupropion, SSRIs/SNRIs, antipsychotics, caffeine/energy drinks, cannabis, tramadol, some antibiotics, and withdrawal from benzodiazepines can all cause or worsen jerks/tics.\n- Metabolic issues: low magnesium/calcium/sodium, kidney/liver problems, thyroid hormone imbalance, or blood sugar swings can cause myoclonus.\n\nHow to tell tics from myoclonic jerks\n- Tics: premonitory urge, can sometimes be delayed/suppressed, often repeated in the same way, relief after doing them.\n- Myoclonus: sudden “electric shock” jerks without warning and not suppressible; can cause dropping objects; often clustered, especially in mornings.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) EEG, ideally sleep‑deprived with photic stimulation; if normal but suspicion remains, ask about a 24–72 hr ambulatory EEG or video‑EEG monitoring. EEG—not MRI—is the key test for myoclonic epilepsy.\n2) Bring phone videos of the jerks to your neurologist; note time of day (especially mornings), triggers, and whether you can suppress them.\n3) Medication review with your doctor:\n   - List all meds/supplements, doses, and timing.\n   - ADHD meds: stimulants can worsen tics and lower seizure threshold if sleep is poor. Non‑stimulants like guanfacine/clonidine can help both ADHD and tics in some people.\n   - Anxiety meds: SSRIs can rarely cause myoclonus; benzodiazepine withdrawal can too.\n4) Labs: TSH and free T4 (to ensure your thyroid dose is right), CMP (kidney/liver), electrolytes (Mg, Ca, Na), glucose/A1c, possibly B12/folate.\n5) Manage triggers now: strict sleep schedule, avoid alcohol/binge drinking, limit caffeine/energy drinks, take regular meals to avoid lows in blood sugar, reduce screen flicker/bright flashing lights if they trigger jerks, manage stress.\n6) Safety until clarified: use caution with driving per your local rules if epilepsy is suspected; avoid swimming alone, heights, and operating dangerous machinery. Your neurologist can advise based on your episodes.\n7) Anxiety support: uncertainty is hard, but you’re doing the right steps. Breathing exercises, CBT skills, and regular sleep can reduce both anxiety and jerks.\n\nTreatment if it is JME\n- Very treatable. Common options: levetiracetam, valproate, lamotrigine, or topiramate. In men, valproate is highly effective; levetiracetam can work well but may worsen irritability/anxiety in some. Your doctor will tailor this to your other conditions and meds.\n\nA few questions that will help narrow this:\n- Do the jerks happen mostly in the morning after waking?\n- Can you feel an urge before them or suppress them at all?\n- Any history of blackouts or generalized convulsions?\n- Do sleep loss, alcohol, or flashing lights make them worse?\n- What ADHD/anxiety meds and doses are you taking now?\n- Any recent med changes or missed doses?\n- Can you capture a short video of a typical episode?\n\nIf you can share the exact MRI report text and your current medication list, I can help interpret what’s likely and what to discuss with your neurologist. Overall, a normal MRI is good news, and many people with jerks like yours get a clear answer and effective treatment once EEG and triggers/meds are reviewed.",

    "question": "The other day I didn't use the dosage cup and just swallowed some Pepto-Bismol Max. I guess it was maybe a mouthful? I don't know how much that is but it felt like a \"large swallow\". Maybe as much as the max daily dosage of 120mL. That was all I had for at least 24 hours in either direction.I don't think I feel any symptoms different than what I usually feel. I read that toxicity can cause confusion and ringing in the ears. But I always seem to have ringing in the ears from time to time, and I have epilepsy so I'm always a little tired and confused (I take carbamazapine 300mg 2x).How concerned should I be? 28 year old white male. About 160lbs and 5'6",
    "answer": "Short answer: You’re very unlikely to have any toxicity from what you described, and no action is needed if you still feel fine more than 24 hours later.\n\nWhy:\n- Pepto-Bismol Max Strength is 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate per 15 mL. Even if you took the entire daily maximum (120 mL) all at once, that’s about 4,200 mg total.\n- For your weight (~73 kg), that amount is well below doses associated with salicylate toxicity. Acute toxicity usually starts at roughly 150 mg/kg of salicylate; your possible dose is far under that threshold.\n- Serious bismuth toxicity is rare and typically occurs with prolonged high doses or kidney problems.\n\nWhat to watch for over the next day or two:\n- Worsening or persistent ringing in the ears (clearly more than your usual), new hearing changes\n- Nausea/vomiting, fast breathing, dizziness, marked confusion, severe stomach pain\n- Black, tarry, foul-smelling stools with weakness (different from the harmless gray/black discoloration Pepto can cause)\n- Any increase in seizure frequency or unusual neurological symptoms\n\nIf any of the above occur, call Poison Control (US: 1-800-222-1222) or seek urgent care. Otherwise, you don’t need to do anything.\n\nTips for next time:\n- Use the dosing cup. For Pepto-Bismol Max Strength liquid, the adult dose is 15 mL per dose, up to 8 doses (120 mL) in 24 hours.\n- Avoid combining it with other salicylates (like aspirin) at the same time.\n- Black tongue or stool can be a normal, temporary effect.\n\nIf you have a history of aspirin/salicylate allergy, stomach ulcers/bleeding, or kidney disease, avoid Pepto in the future and talk with your clinician about alternatives.",

    "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re both going through this. What you describe is frightening, disabling, and understandably exhausting. I’m glad you reached out.\n\nFirst, about safety and the comment about suicide:\n- If either of you feels she might harm herself, please seek urgent help now. In the EU you can call 112. In the US call/text 988. In the UK/Ireland call Samaritans at 116 123. You can also find local crisis lines at findahelpline.com. You don’t have to handle this alone.\n- Regardless of the cause of the episodes, the psychological toll is real. Involve a mental‑health professional now for support and safety planning. This is not saying “it’s in her head”—it’s about protecting her while the medical workup continues.\n\nWhat could be going on\nSeveral conditions can cause repeated “fainting” with headaches, visual changes, and brief shaking, especially in young women. A few to ask doctors about directly:\n1) Autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic intolerance/POTS, vasovagal syncope)\n- Often worse with standing, heat, stress, after meals, dehydration, and with low BMI.\n- Can cause presyncope/syncope, headache, visual dimming, and sometimes brief convulsive movements from low brain blood flow.\n- Can be evaluated with an active stand test or tilt‑table test (HR and BP measured over 10+ minutes), and comprehensive autonomic testing.\n2) Psychogenic pseudosyncope (PPS) or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), forms of functional neurological disorder (FND)\n- Characterized by apparent loss of consciousness that can last 10–30 minutes, can occur lying down, often with hyperventilation and eyes closed, and normal brain and heart tests between events.\n- Not “faked”; it’s a real, brain‑based disorder of function that is treatable. Diagnosis is made by capturing an event with video‑EEG plus vitals (often during tilt‑table testing or in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit).\n3) Convulsive syncope vs epilepsy\n- Brief jerks during a faint are common; however, 10–30 minutes of unresponsiveness is unusual for syncope and pushes doctors to confirm with video‑EEG during an event. Two normal MRIs/CTs do not rule out epilepsy or PNES.\n4) Migraine variants (brainstem aura or hemiplegic migraine)\n- Can cause severe headache, visual loss, unilateral numbness/weakness, dizziness, and sometimes syncope‑like events. A headache specialist can help with diagnosis and non‑sedating treatment options.\n5) Cardiac rhythm problems\n- Intermittent arrhythmias can be missed on short tests. Consider prolonged monitoring (event monitor or implantable loop recorder) and an echocardiogram if not already done.\n6) Metabolic/endocrine contributors\n- Hypoglycemia (especially if episodes follow carbs), anemia/low iron, thyroid, adrenal, electrolyte issues, B12 deficiency, dehydration/malnutrition.\n\nAbout the timing with vaccination\n- Immediate fainting after vaccination is often vasovagal syncope. A small number of people develop orthostatic intolerance/POTS after infections or, rarely, after vaccines. Regardless of the trigger, the priority is to identify the current mechanism and treat it. I would avoid further vaccination until there’s a clear diagnosis and a plan, decided with her clinicians.\n\nWhat to ask for next (bring this list to her doctors)\n- Capture an event:\n  - Video‑EEG monitoring with simultaneous EKG/BP (Epilepsy Monitoring Unit) or a tilt‑table test with EEG to distinguish syncope/POTS from PPS/PNES.\n- Autonomic evaluation:\n  - Active stand test (10 minutes) or tilt‑table test; autonomic lab testing (Valsalva, HR variability, QSART).\n- Cardiac evaluation:\n  - 12‑lead ECG, echocardiogram (if not done), and prolonged rhythm monitoring (2–4 week event monitor or loop recorder).\n- Laboratory screen:\n  - CBC, ferritin/iron studies, CMP (electrolytes, kidney, liver), Mg, phosphorus, Ca, TSH/free T4, morning cortisol, B12/folate, HbA1c; pregnancy test if applicable.\n- Check finger‑stick glucose during an episode, especially after meals. If low or if symptoms track with meals, consider a continuous glucose monitor and try low‑glycemic, high‑protein/fat meals.\n\nPractical things you can start now (if safe for her and cleared by a doctor)\n- Safety:\n  - No driving, swimming alone, heights, or bathing alone. Sit to shower. Use a soft helmet if falls/head hits continue. Keep doors unlocked when she’s alone.\n  - If an event starts, lay her on her side, protect her head, do not put anything in her mouth. Time it. Call emergency services if injury, cyanosis, or an episode lasts >5–10 minutes without any responsiveness.\n- Track data:\n  - Record a clear phone video of a full episode (face/eyes, breathing, limb movements). Note posture, triggers, duration, skin color, eye opening/closure, and recovery.\n  - Keep a diary: sleep, meals, fluids, periods, stress, posture, exertion, and symptoms. If possible, record HR/BP with a home monitor or wearable before/during prodrome.\n- Hydration/nutrition (if no heart/kidney issues and after confirming with a clinician):\n  - Aim for 2–3 L fluids/day and increased salt (up to 3–10 g/day) for suspected orthostatic intolerance.\n  - Small, frequent meals; emphasize protein/fat and lower‑glycemic carbs; avoid very large carbohydrate loads and alcohol. Consider oral rehydration solutions rather than plain water.\n  - Given her low BMI and intake, ask for an urgent dietitian referral; malnutrition worsens orthostatic symptoms.\n- Compression:\n  - Waist‑high 20–30 mmHg compression stockings and/or an abdominal binder.\n- Conditioning:\n  - If tolerated, recumbent exercise (rowing, recumbent bike) in short, frequent sessions can help POTS; avoid upright strenuous exertion until cleared.\n\nHow to talk with doctors so this gets traction\n- Ask for: “We need to capture an event with video‑EEG plus continuous HR/BP, ideally via tilt‑table or in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit, and we’d like referral to an autonomic disorders clinic to evaluate for POTS/orthostatic intolerance versus psychogenic pseudosyncope.”\n- Bring your video and diary. They are often the turning point in getting the right diagnosis.\n\nA note on functional neurological disorder (PNES/PPS)\n- If that ends up being the diagnosis, it is real, common, and treatable. Many people improve with education, targeted physiotherapy, and CBT delivered by clinicians familiar with FND. It does not mean she’s “making it up,” and it can coexist with migraine or POTS.\n\nMedication caution\n- Given her sensitivity, prioritize non‑drug measures first. If POTS is confirmed, medications like fludrocortisone, midodrine, low‑dose beta‑blocker, ivabradine, or pyridostigmine may help—but only under specialist guidance.\n\nPlease consider urgent re‑evaluation now because of:\n- Frequent collapses with risk of head injury\n- Ongoing weight loss and low BMI\n- Episodes with exertion\n- Suicidal statements born of distress\n\nIf it helps, reply with your country/region and I can list nearby autonomic disorder centers, epilepsy monitoring units, and headache/FND specialists. I’m rooting for you both. This is solvable, and you deserve a team that will methodically capture an event and narrow this down.",

    "question": "I’m a 23 year old female. I have recently been getting very dizzy, my body gets hot and seeing stars until my vision disappears completely and I can’t see at all and it doesn’t go away until I lay down or sit. I have never had a problem like this ever but it’s starting to interfere with my life because I’m always having to sit. I’m 5”3 and I weigh around a 100 pounds. My weight does fluctuate a lot (+ or - 5 pounds every week) I try to eat healthy but I also sometimes can’t get myself to eat because I feel anxiety and my heart starts beating weird. I also have epilepsy and I am on Keppra and have been on it for almost 3 years so I don’t think that’s the problem but I try to take it on time, I take 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don’t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time. I add a lot of salt on my food, I eat a lot of olives and a lot of pickles, sometimes I will individually season spoonfuls or food before putting them in my mouth because it’s what tastes good to me (if that is of any significance)And I do drink alcohol about 3 times a week",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing all of that—what you’re describing is concerning and deserves a proper medical evaluation soon.\n\nWhat it sounds like\n- Your symptoms (dizziness, getting hot, “seeing stars,” vision dimming/blackout that improves when you sit or lie down) are classic for presyncope from orthostatic intolerance—most commonly orthostatic hypotension or POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). These happen when blood doesn’t get to the brain adequately after standing.\n- Contributing factors in your case could include: low body weight and inconsistent eating (low blood sugar/low volume), dehydration (including from alcohol), anemia (especially if periods are heavy), thyroid or vitamin deficiencies, and less commonly adrenal issues (salt craving can be a clue), heart rhythm problems, or medication effects. Keppra can cause dizziness, but after 3 years it’s less likely the new cause; alcohol can worsen dizziness and seizure risk.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now\nGo to urgent/ER if you have:\n- Fainting (not just almost fainting), chest pain, shortness of breath, new or very fast/irregular heartbeat, severe headache, neurological symptoms (weakness, trouble speaking), black or bloody stools, vomiting/diarrhea with poor intake, confusion, or if you injure yourself during an episode. Also if episodes occur while lying down or with exertion.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Make an appointment with your primary care clinician within 1–2 weeks (sooner if worsening). Because this is frequent and interfering with life, it should be evaluated.\n- Ask for: orthostatic vitals, ECG, and blood tests (CBC and ferritin for anemia, electrolytes/kidney function, glucose/A1c, TSH, vitamin B12/folate, pregnancy test if applicable). Given the salt craving and symptoms, ask about morning cortisol/ACTH to screen for adrenal insufficiency. If orthostatic testing is positive or symptoms persist, consider a tilt-table test; if palpitations are prominent, a Holter monitor.\n- Review meds and alcohol use with your clinician, including Keppra timing and any missed doses.\n\nSelf-care now to reduce episodes\n- Hydration: aim for about 2–3 liters of fluids daily unless a doctor has told you otherwise. Use water and/or an oral rehydration solution. Alcohol dehydrates—try to avoid it for now.\n- Salt: people with orthostatic intolerance are often advised to increase salt. You already eat a lot, so don’t push salt higher until you’re evaluated; focus on fluids first.\n- Nutrition: don’t skip meals. Try small, frequent, balanced meals/snacks with protein and complex carbs. Keep an easy snack handy if anxiety curbs appetite.\n- Position changes: rise slowly; before standing, tense your leg/buttock muscles or cross your legs and squeeze to push blood upward. If an episode starts, lie down with legs elevated.\n- Compression: consider waist-high 20–30 mmHg compression stockings and/or an abdominal binder.\n- Exercise: if able, start gentle recumbent exercise (e.g., cycling, rowing) and gradually build up.\n- Safety: until this is under control, avoid driving, heights, hot showers, and being alone in situations where a fall would be dangerous.\n\nKeppra and alcohol\n- Take Keppra exactly on schedule; set alarms if needed. Alcohol can worsen dizziness and increase seizure risk, especially with missed doses or poor sleep. Best to hold alcohol until you’re assessed.\n\nHelpful at-home check\n- If you have a blood pressure cuff or smartwatch: after lying down 5 minutes, record BP/HR; then stand and record at 1 and 3 minutes. A BP drop (≥20 systolic or ≥10 diastolic) suggests orthostatic hypotension. A HR rise ≥30 bpm (without a big BP drop) with symptoms suggests POTS. Share this log with your clinician.\n\nA few questions that help triage\n- Do episodes mainly occur after standing up or standing still? Have you fully fainted?\n- Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or pounding/irregular heartbeats?\n- How heavy are your periods? Any fatigue, pale skin, or cravings for ice/soil (pica)?\n- How much fluid do you drink daily, and what color is your urine (very light vs dark)?\n- Any recent illness, vomiting/diarrhea, or weight loss beyond your usual fluctuations?\n- Any chance of pregnancy?\n- Family history of heart rhythm problems or sudden cardiac death?\n\nPlease schedule that appointment soon, and reply with the answers above if you’d like help thinking through urgency.",

    "question": "25f 110ish lbs Everyday smoker Cannabis use Non drinker 200mg lamotrigine 2x daily 400mg zonsimide 2x daily Refractory epilepsy of unknown origin(possibly localized but won't know until I go in for my EMU)Hello so as you can see I have refractory epilepsy and my specialist and I are talking about me begining the steps towards a surgical approach as I'm still having breakthrough seizures. I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
    "answer": "You’re doing all the right things by getting into an EMU and asking these questions before committing to surgery. Drug‑resistant epilepsy is tough, and there are several evidence‑based options to consider before (or alongside) laser ablation or VNS. Here’s a concise overview you can take to your specialist.\n\nMedical options to discuss\n- Recheck the basics first\n  - Confirm doses/levels and adherence. Your lamotrigine 200 mg twice daily is common, but zonisamide 400 mg twice daily (800 mg/day) is higher than typical max in many practices (often 300–600 mg/day). If that dose is correct, it’s worth revisiting benefit vs side effects and serum bicarbonate (zonisamide can cause metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, and weight loss).\n  - Therapeutic drug monitoring: lamotrigine levels can be lowered by cigarette smoke (induces UGT enzymes). If you smoke daily, your level may be subtherapeutic; if you cut down/quit, the level can rise—so levels and dose may need adjustment. Estrogen‑containing birth control also lowers lamotrigine levels.\n  - Check for catamenial pattern (seizures clustering around menses). If present, options include cyclic benzodiazepines, acetazolamide, or progesterone therapy.\n\n- Consider additional/alternate antiseizure meds (especially for focal epilepsy)\n  - Cenobamate: among the most effective modern add‑ons for focal seizures; requires slow titration and interaction monitoring but often worth a trial before device/surgery.\n  - Others that can be effective/tolerable depending on your profile: brivaracetam, lacosamide, perampanel, oxcarbazepine/eslicarbazepine, topiramate, clobazam. Choice depends on side‑effect risks and your seizure type.\n  - Rescue options for clusters or prolonged seizures: intranasal midazolam or diazepam.\n\n- Diet therapies (done with a dietitian)\n  - Ketogenic diet, modified Atkins diet, or low‑glycemic‑index treatment can reduce seizures in many adults. If you’ve only “modified” diet on your own, a formal program may provide more benefit and monitoring (lipids, acidosis, kidney stones—especially relevant with zonisamide).\n\nDevice/surgical options besides laser ablation and VNS\n- Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS): For 1–2 identifiable seizure foci that aren’t safely resectable. Median long‑term reductions ~60–75%, some patients achieve long periods of seizure freedom.\n- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS—anterior nucleus of thalamus): For focal, often multifocal epilepsy. Long‑term median reductions similar to RNS.\n- Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS): Can help focal or generalized epilepsies; median reduction often ~30–50% over time, but lower chance of complete seizure freedom than RNS/DBS.\n- Resective surgery or LITT: If EMU shows a well‑localized focus in non‑eloquent cortex, this still offers the highest chance of seizure freedom. The EMU, MRI/PET/SPECT/MEG, and neuropsychology will clarify candidacy.\n\nCannabis, smoking, and complementary therapies\n- Cannabis: Recreational THC‑dominant products can worsen seizures or sleep and interact with meds. Pharmaceutical CBD (Epidiolex) helps specific syndromes (Dravet/LGS/TSC); evidence for adult focal epilepsy is limited/mixed and drug interactions are real. If considering CBD, do it through your neurologist so levels and interactions are monitored.\n- Cigarette smoking: Can suppress lamotrigine levels and worsen sleep—both can increase seizure risk. If you plan to reduce or quit, ask your team to recheck lamotrigine levels and watch for side effects as levels rise.\n- Acupuncture: Research is low‑quality/negative overall. Some people feel better, but it hasn’t shown reliable seizure reduction. Safe as an adjunct if you want to try it, but don’t rely on it.\n- Chiropractic manipulation: No evidence for epilepsy, and high‑velocity neck manipulation carries a small but serious stroke risk. Not recommended for seizure control.\n- Neurofeedback/biofeedback, mindfulness, CBT‑I for sleep: May help with stress/sleep triggers; evidence for seizure reduction is mixed but low risk.\n\nSafety and lifestyle\n- Sleep consistency, stress reduction, hydration/nutrition, avoiding missed doses, and limiting triggers (sleep deprivation, high‑THC products) can meaningfully reduce breakthrough risk.\n- Ask about SUDEP risk counseling, nighttime seizure detection options, and a personalized rescue plan.\n\nWhat would help me tailor suggestions\n- Seizure type(s) and pattern (any link to menstrual cycle)?\n- Which antiseizure meds you’ve tried and at what doses?\n- Whether “400 mg zonisamide twice daily” is correct.\n- Any side effects you’re experiencing.\n- Details of your cannabis use (THC vs CBD content, timing, and dose).\n\nBottom line\nBefore committing to laser or VNS, many patients explore: a formal ketogenic/modified Atkins program; a trial of cenobamate (and/or other modern ASMs) with level monitoring; and, depending on EMU results, RNS or DBS. Acupuncture is okay as an adjunct but unlikely to control seizures; chiropractic manipulation is not recommended. Bring this list to your specialist and we can map it to your EMU findings once you have them.",

    "question": "I've been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in two session, I stopped the first time due to cognitive side effects. However I started it again and I'm perplexed. I've always had intense headaches post ECT and during the first session I had intense deja vu experiences 2-10 times per day, this after about 1,5 months lowered to 3 times per week but up to 10 times a day. With this I developed difficulties placing people I've recently met, when I had gotten to know a face something in me just told me that I had known them since long. This time around, everyone I meet I recognise. Yesterday I was hours away from my hometown, and somehow I only met people I knew...but no one said hello...Anyone know information about this occurrence and whether it's a neurological concern or just a temporary side effect? My ECT-nurse had never heard of it before.Info: Male, 24 y/o, Caucasian, mucho depressed, no medications only ECT.",
    "answer": "Short answer: what you’re describing sounds like a “familiarity/misidentification” phenomenon linked to the same brain circuits ECT affects (medial/right temporal lobe), and it has been reported after seizures and, more rarely, after ECT. It’s often temporary, but because it’s unusual and distressing, it’s worth a prompt review with your ECT psychiatrist and possibly a neurology consult.\n\nWhat your symptoms suggest\n- Recurrent déjà vu and the sense that strangers are familiar fall under paramnesias (e.g., hyperfamiliarity for faces, Fregoli‑like phenomena). These are classically associated with right/mesial temporal lobe dysfunction—the areas involved in memory and “familiarity” processing.\n- ECT intentionally induces generalized seizures; post‑ictal cognitive effects (headache, confusion, memory issues) are common. Rarely, people can experience frequent déjà vu or hyperfamiliarity between treatments, similar to simple focal (temporal lobe) seizure auras.\n- This can be more likely with bilateral ECT or higher stimulus doses and often improves when parameters are adjusted (e.g., right‑unilateral ultrabrief pulse, spacing treatments).\n\nWhat to do now\n- Tell your ECT psychiatrist before your next treatment. Ask about:\n  - Switching to right‑unilateral ultrabrief pulse if not already.\n  - Lowering dose or increasing spacing.\n  - Cognitive monitoring during the course.\n- Ask for a neurology review and an EEG to look for interictal temporal lobe activity; consider brain MRI if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Keep a brief diary of episodes (time, duration, triggers, associated sensations like odd smells, rising stomach feeling, fear, lip smacking, confusion). This helps distinguish transient side effects from focal seizures.\n- Manage post‑ECT headaches: good hydration, sleep, light caffeine if tolerated, and pre‑treatment analgesics (discuss with your team). Avoid alcohol/cannabis and severe sleep deprivation, which can lower seizure threshold.\n\nSeek urgent care if any of the following occur\n- New seizures or loss of awareness outside ECT sessions.\n- Severe or worsening headache, neck stiffness, fever.\n- Focal neurological symptoms (vision or speech changes, weakness/numbness).\n- Confusion lasting more than an hour post‑treatment.\n- Suicidal thoughts or drastic mood/behavior changes.\n\nReassurance\n- While not the most common side effect, misidentification/familiarity disturbances have been described after seizures and ECT and often resolve over days to weeks, especially with parameter adjustments.\n- Your age and the absence of meds reduce the chance of medication‑induced déjà vu, making an ECT/temporal‑lobe mechanism more likely—and potentially modifiable.\n\nIf you can, please share:\n- ECT parameters (bilateral vs right‑unilateral, pulse width, dose relative to seizure threshold, number of sessions so far).\n- Whether episodes are seconds to minutes, any loss of awareness, or other aura‑like symptoms.\nThat can help tailor next steps.",

    "question": "35 yo female with history of migraines as a child. MRI, ekg totally clear.Fainted a few times which caused a visit to a neurologist who was quick to diagnose with epilepsy. No longer loosing consciousness but symptoms are still present.    Wave of “feeling ill” usually nauseous    Followed by involuntary grimacing (as if I sucked on a lemon)    Slurred or slow speech 80% of the time    Feels like my brain is swollen - but only the part of my forehead    Sometimes itchy scalp    After the episode I feel like I was hit by a truck for the next few hoursDoes this sound like a seizure? Could it be something else?I refuse to take anti seizure meds without being confident and the lack of proof makes me weary of doctors who are quick to prescribe such strong meds.",
    "answer": "I can’t diagnose you here, but the pattern you describe could be consistent with focal seizures, and there are also reasonable non‑epileptic possibilities. A few points to help you sort this out:\n\nWhy seizures are on the table\n- The “wave of feeling ill/nausea” can be an autonomic aura, common in focal seizures (often temporal or insular).\n- Involuntary facial movements or grimacing and brief speech disturbance (slurred/slow, speech arrest) can occur during focal seizures.\n- Feeling wiped out for hours afterward fits a postictal period.\n- Many people with epilepsy have normal MRI; EEG can also be normal between events.\n\nWhy it might be something else\n- Migraine variants (especially brainstem/vestibular or hemiplegic migraine) can cause nausea, transient speech problems, sensory symptoms, and a “postdrome” of fatigue—even without much headache. Involuntary facial grimacing would be less typical, though.\n- Reflex syncope/dysautonomia (e.g., POTS) can cause waves of nausea and presyncope, especially if episodes relate to standing, dehydration, heat, or prolonged standing.\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic events (PNES) can mimic seizures; diagnosis requires video‑EEG during an event.\n- Metabolic causes (hypoglycemia, electrolyte issues, thyroid) can precipitate similar spells.\n\nKey questions that help differentiate\n- How long do episodes last (seconds, 1–2 minutes, 10–30 minutes, longer)?\n- Are they stereotyped (nearly identical each time)?\n- Is awareness preserved throughout?\n- Any triggers (sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol, illness, menstrual cycle)?\n- Any headache before/after, sensitivity to light/sound, visual aura?\n- Any tongue biting, drooling, eye deviation, or limb jerking?\n- Relationship to standing up or being in hot/crowded places?\n- Frequency per week/month and any injuries?\n\nWhat testing would give you more confidence\n- Video‑EEG monitoring that captures one of your typical events is the gold standard to confirm or exclude epileptic seizures. A routine EEG can be normal; consider prolonged ambulatory (48–72 hr) or inpatient monitoring.\n- MRI with an “epilepsy protocol” (thin cuts at 3T) if not already done with that protocol.\n- Orthostatic vitals or tilt‑table testing if fainting/presyncope is still an issue.\n- Basic labs (CBC, CMP, fasting glucose or CGM if spells could be hypoglycemia, TSH, B12). Review meds/substances that lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, tramadol, some antibiotics, diphenhydramine, decongestants, cannabis concentrates, heavy alcohol).\n\nAbout medication\n- It’s reasonable to want diagnostic confidence before starting anti‑seizure medication (ASM). Many neurologists will prioritize capturing an event on video‑EEG in cases like yours.\n- If epilepsy seems likely and events are frequent or risky, ASMs can be started with a shared decision approach. For focal seizures, options with relatively favorable profiles include lamotrigine or lacosamide; levetiracetam is effective but can affect mood in some. Start low, go slow, and track side effects.\n- If migraine is suspected, non‑prescription options like magnesium glycinate 300–400 mg/day and riboflavin (B2) 400 mg/day may help; prescription preventives are also available.\n\nSafety in the meantime\n- Don’t drive if you have episodes with impaired awareness, speech you can’t control, or involuntary movements; follow your local regulations.\n- Shower instead of bathe; avoid heights, swimming alone, open flames; sleep regularly; limit alcohol; manage stress.\n- Keep a detailed diary and, if possible, have someone record a typical spell on video—this is extremely helpful for your team.\n\nHow to move forward\n- Ask your neurologist for prolonged ambulatory or inpatient video‑EEG aimed at capturing an event, and confirm your MRI was done with an epilepsy protocol.\n- If syncope remains a concern, request orthostatic vitals/tilt‑table testing.\n- Consider a second opinion with an epilepsy specialist (epileptologist) if you haven’t seen one yet.\n\nIf you share more details (duration, frequency, triggers, awareness, relation to standing or menses, presence/absence of headache), I can help narrow the differential and suggest the most targeted next steps.",

    "question": "i’m 18 years old, 5’3, i don’t take any medications, i vape and smoke weed. i do cocaine, so i was driving and i felt a weird like strain in my neck on the left side, then the left side of my face went numb. my tongue went numb and my left eye felt weird. my arm went numb too. then i pulled over and my hearing started to fade. my vision started to go black and i passed out. when i was unconscious it felt very euphoric and safe, it felt like i died. and then i woke up suddenly and took a breath and i had pissed myself. my friend with me said it looked like i was having a seizure but i had never had a seizure before. while i was at the doctor my blood sugar was normal but my blood pressure was low, my ekg was normal, the doctors took blood and said nothing was wrong. what do you guys think is wrong with me",
    "answer": "What you describe is an emergency-pattern event. The combination of sudden left‑sided face/arm numbness, “weird” eye sensation, neck pain on the same side, loss of hearing/vision, loss of consciousness with reported shaking and urinary incontinence is very concerning for:\n- A tear in a neck artery (carotid or vertebral artery dissection) causing a transient ischemic attack or stroke. Neck strain right before symptoms is a classic clue, and cocaine greatly increases the risk through vasospasm and blood pressure surges.\n- A seizure (cocaine can trigger seizures on its own, and seizures can also be secondary to a stroke/TIA).\n- Less likely but possible: complex/hemiplegic migraine or vasovagal syncope, but those are diagnoses of exclusion.\n\nA normal EKG and routine blood tests do not rule out stroke or an artery tear. This needs urgent brain and vessel imaging.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Go to the emergency department now (preferably a stroke-capable center). Do not drive yourself. Call emergency services if you’re alone or if symptoms recur.\n- Tell them exactly what you wrote here, including the neck strain, one-sided symptoms, loss of consciousness, urinary incontinence, and recent cocaine use.\n\nWhat evaluation you likely need\n- CT angiography or MR angiography of the head and neck to look for carotid/vertebral artery dissection.\n- MRI brain to look for signs of stroke.\n- Continuous heart monitoring and repeat ECG; basic labs and electrolytes; possibly an EEG to evaluate for seizure.\n\nUntil you’re medically cleared\n- Do not drive, swim alone, climb heights, or bathe unsupervised (showers only). These are standard seizure precautions.\n- Avoid all stimulants, especially cocaine, and ideally avoid nicotine and cannabis for now. Cocaine can cause vasospasm, stroke, arrhythmias, and seizures.\n\nIf any symptoms return, call emergency services immediately\n- New or recurrent one-sided weakness/numbness, facial droop, trouble speaking, severe neck or head pain, vision changes, chest pain, palpitations, repeated vomiting, or confusion.\n\nIf you want support to stop cocaine or other substances, help is available: in the U.S., SAMHSA’s 24/7 helpline 1-800-662-HELP (4357) can connect you to local resources.\n\nBottom line: Your story fits a potentially serious vascular or neurological event that initial basic tests can miss. Please get emergency re-evaluation with head/neck vascular imaging as soon as possible.",

Let me inform you that this has led to a seizure only once before (for the last 10 years) and the doctors said it was from dehydration. But the twitching won't stop, any clue what it is? It doesn't cause any pain or fatigue afterwards, just a little stress that it could have been a serious seizure like before. I don't know its happening until afterwards, and it happens everytime i try to re-focus.",
    "answer": "What you’re describing sounds like brief lapses in awareness followed by a sudden, whole‑body jerk (myoclonus). A few possibilities to consider:\n\n- Epileptic causes:\n  - Absence seizures: very brief “blank” spells with immediate recovery, sometimes not noticed by the person, can cause loss of focus.\n  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME): typically starts in teens; features brief myoclonic jerks (often on awakening or with sleep deprivation, stress, or flashing light) and sometimes brief absences. A past “dehydration”-related seizure may have been a generalized seizure with a lowered seizure threshold rather than dehydration as the sole cause.\n- Non-epileptic causes:\n  - Microsleeps/sleep deprivation: brief nodding off with a sudden startle‑like jerk when you “snap back.” Often worse with poor sleep, boredom, or sedentary focus.\n  - Tics or anxiety-related startle: less likely if you have unawareness during the event and it involves the whole body.\n\nBecause you have:\n- Recurrent events with impaired awareness (“I don’t know it’s happening until afterwards”)\n- A prior convulsive seizure (even if attributed to dehydration)\n\nYou should be evaluated by a clinician, ideally a neurologist.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Make an appointment with your primary care clinician or a neurologist. Ask for:\n  - Neurologic exam and medication/substance review (stimulants, SSRIs, bupropion, tramadol, energy drinks, cannabis, alcohol).\n  - EEG (with hyperventilation and photic stimulation). If normal but suspicion remains, a sleep‑deprived or ambulatory EEG can help.\n  - Consider brain MRI if EEG is abnormal or if there are focal neurological signs.\n  - If daytime sleepiness is prominent, consider a sleep assessment.\n- Keep an event diary: time of day, what you were doing, sleep the night before, caffeine/alcohol, screens/flashing lights, how long the lapse lasts, and whether anyone noticed staring/eyelid fluttering. If possible, have someone record an episode on video.\n\nSafety until you’re evaluated\n- Get regular sleep (8–9 hours), avoid sleep deprivation, alcohol, and recreational drugs. Limit caffeine/energy drinks.\n- Reduce seizure triggers: manage stress, take screen breaks, avoid flashing lights; use screen flicker reduction settings.\n- Avoid driving, swimming alone, heights, or operating dangerous equipment until cleared, especially since you’re having unawareness.\n- Stay well hydrated but know that dehydration alone usually isn’t the sole cause of seizures.\n\nSeek urgent care now if\n- A seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, or you have repeated seizures without full recovery between them.\n- You’re injured, pregnant, or have diabetes.\n- You develop fever, severe headache, stiff neck, new weakness, or confusion after an event.\n\nA few clarifying questions to help narrow this:\n- Do these episodes cluster in the morning or after poor sleep?\n- Do you ever drop things or have quick arm jerks, especially when tired?\n- Has anyone noticed staring, eyelid fluttering, lip smacking, or pauses mid‑sentence?\n- Any recent changes in meds, supplements, or caffeine/energy drink use?\n- Family history of seizures?\n\nIf this does turn out to be an epileptic syndrome like JME or absence epilepsy, treatment is usually very effective, and lifestyle measures make a big difference.",

    "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",

What you describe overlaps with non-REM parasomnias (confusional arousals/sleepwalking), but several features also raise concern for sleep‑related seizures, and distinguishing the two often requires a specialist and video‑EEG.\n\nWhy this isn’t a typical night terror/sleepwalking alone:\n- Occurs in the first 1–2 hours of sleep (fits NREM parasomnia), but…\n- Highly stereotyped sequence of phases each time, with repetitive automatisms (rocking, slapping, tongue‑clicking, brief vocalizations), running back and forth, then a sudden, specific, compelled task.\n- She often seems aware and can sometimes converse, and she remembers the episodes in detail the next day. Classic NREM parasomnias usually have little to no recall and less coherent interaction.\n- The “weird feeling in her forehead” and visual distortions (doorframe too small, a clone present) sound like an aura. A consistent aura and oroalimentary automatisms (tongue clicking) are more suggestive of focal seizures, particularly sleep‑related hypermotor/frontal lobe seizures, than of simple parasomnia.\n\nLess likely but worth noting:\n- REM behavior disorder is rare at her age and typically occurs later in the night.\n- Antibiotic neurotoxicity from cefixime is unlikely given timing and pattern, but do mention the course to your clinician.\n- Travel/illness/sleep disruption can trigger parasomnias, but they can also lower seizure threshold.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Make an appointment with her pediatrician soon (days to a couple of weeks) and ask for referral to pediatric neurology and/or a pediatric sleep specialist.\n- Try to capture a full video of an episode (good lighting, include her face, limbs, and sounds). Note:\n  - Time since sleep onset and total duration\n  - Breathing changes, skin color, eye deviation, asymmetry of movements\n  - Responsiveness to voice/touch, ability to follow commands\n  - Any incontinence, tongue biting, or injury\n- Keep a diary of sleep schedule, stress/illness, medications, and each event.\n\nLikely tests the specialists may consider\n- Overnight video EEG or a polysomnogram with extended EEG leads to differentiate parasomnia from seizures.\n- Routine or sleep‑deprived EEG; brain MRI if EEG suggests a focal origin.\n\nSafety and management in the meantime\n- Optimize sleep: consistent schedule, adequate total sleep, minimize sleep deprivation.\n- Keep the sleep environment safe: remove sharp objects, secure windows/doors, low bed, clear floor.\n- During episodes, stay calm, gently guide her away from hazards, avoid restraining forcefully. You can allow benign, brief completion of her “task” if it helps her settle, but prioritize safety.\n- When to seek urgent care: any episode with sustained whole‑body stiffening/jerking over 5 minutes, repeated events with no recovery between, breathing problems or blue color, head injury, new weakness/numbness, persistent confusion, severe headache with vomiting or fever/neck stiffness.\n\nA note on ADHD/anxiety: these don’t cause seizures, but sleep loss, stress, and transitions can make both parasomnias and seizures more likely. Since she’s not on stimulant medication yet, meds are unlikely to be a trigger here.\n\nBottom line: New, recurrent, stereotyped nocturnal episodes with automatisms, a possible aura, and preserved recall should be evaluated for sleep‑related epilepsy. Capture video, ensure safety, and arrange pediatric neurology/sleep evaluation.",

    "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this. A few key points up front:\n\n- If you’re having thoughts of harming yourself or feel you might act on them, please seek urgent help now: go to A&E or call 999. You can also call NHS 111 for urgent advice, your local NHS crisis team if you have their number, Samaritans 116 123 (24/7), or text SHOUT to 85258. If you can, tell someone you trust and don’t stay alone.\n\nCan SSRIs make depression worse?\n- They usually help, but a minority of people feel worse, especially after dose increases. This can be due to:\n  - Activation/akathisia (inner restlessness, agitation), which can worsen distress or suicidal thoughts.\n  - Emotional blunting/apathy at higher doses.\n  - A true non-response or loss of response over time.\n- Another important factor for you: topiramate can cause or worsen low mood, fatigue, and “brain fog.” Sometimes when topiramate is added or increased, depression worsens.\n\nIs it safe to stop citalopram suddenly?\n- Stopping abruptly is not advised. It can cause discontinuation symptoms (dizziness, “electric zaps,” insomnia, anxiety, low mood) and can make things worse.\n- If you’re feeling significantly worse or more suicidal since the dose increase, this is an urgent reason to speak to a clinician. Same-day GP call-back with the duty doctor, NHS 111, or crisis services are appropriate.\n\nMedication choices with epilepsy and fatigue\n- In people with seizure disorders, some antidepressants are safer than others.\n- Generally avoid:\n  - Bupropion (contraindicated in epilepsy; increases seizure risk).\n  - Tricyclics like amitriptyline and clomipramine (lower seizure threshold; sedating; can worsen fatigue; topiramate can increase amitriptyline levels, raising side-effect risk).\n- Options often considered safer/appropriate:\n  - Another SSRI (e.g., escitalopram) can still work even if others didn’t, but you’ve already tried sertraline and fluoxetine and are on citalopram.\n  - SNRIs: duloxetine is a reasonable option; can be energizing and may help pain/fatigue. Venlafaxine can help but has a slightly higher seizure risk than SSRIs and tougher discontinuation.\n  - Vortioxetine: often well tolerated, tends to be non-sedating and may help cognition; seizure risk appears low. Available on the NHS but not always first line, so discuss with your GP/psychiatrist.\n  - Mirtazapine you’ve tried; it can help anxiety and sleep but often worsens fatigue/weight.\n- Augmentation rather than switching is another approach (e.g., adding psychotherapy like CBT; certain medications), but with epilepsy we avoid options that meaningfully lower seizure threshold.\n\nAbout amitriptyline with topiramate\n- Not ideal. Amitriptyline can increase seizure risk, is sedating, and may interact with topiramate to raise amitriptyline levels, increasing side effects (anticholinergic effects, cognitive slowing). It’s commonly used for migraine, but given epilepsy, fatigue, and topiramate, it’s not a good choice for depression in your situation.\n\nOther considerations\n- Topiramate itself can worsen mood and fatigue. If your depressive symptoms worsened after starting or increasing topiramate, tell your neurologist; an alternative anti-seizure medication might help mood. Note: levetiracetam can also worsen mood in some people; lamotrigine can help depression but can sometimes worsen myoclonus in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy—so any change should be coordinated with neurology.\n- Check for physical contributors to fatigue/low mood: thyroid, iron/ferritin, B12, folate, vitamin D, sleep issues, alcohol/cannabis.\n- Psychological therapies (CBT/BA), regular daylight/exercise, and sleep routines can meaningfully augment medication.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) Seek urgent review rather than stopping suddenly:\n   - Call your GP and ask for an urgent same-day call with the duty doctor due to worsening depression and suicidal thoughts since the dose increase.\n   - If you can’t get through, call NHS 111 for urgent advice. If you feel you can’t stay safe, go to A&E or call 999.\n\n2) Discuss with your clinician:\n   - Whether citalopram should be reduced or tapered and switched. A typical taper from 30 mg might be 20 mg for 1–2 weeks, then 10 mg for 1–2 weeks before stopping, but this should be individualized and supervised.\n   - Switching options: duloxetine or vortioxetine are reasonable given your goals (avoid sedation and twitching) and epilepsy. If venlafaxine is considered, seizure risk needs weighing.\n   - Whether topiramate is contributing to low mood/fatigue, and if your neurology plan could be adjusted.\n\n3) Safety plan while waiting:\n   - Remove or secure potential means of self-harm; lean on supports; schedule daily check-ins with someone; avoid alcohol/recreational drugs; keep a regular sleep/wake time; short daylight walks.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- Whether you’re currently safe and have support around you.\n- When your mood worsened relative to the citalopram dose change and topiramate changes.\n- What side effects you’re feeling (e.g., restlessness, insomnia, numbness/blunting, dizziness).\nI can help you frame a message for your GP/neurologist to speed up a safe plan.",

    "question": "Age 5 Sex male Height 40” Weight40lb Racewhite Duration of complaint 20 months Location Colorado, USA Any existing relevant medical issues CP, epilepsy Current medications Generic keppra 2.5mg/ml 2x daily My 5 yo son with CP and epilepsy My kid is amazing and funny and smart. We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He’s wonderful. I’m so proud of him. He’s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can’t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I’m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I’ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can’t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he’s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn’t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I’m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don’t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I’ve gotten even more protective. We really don’t go anywhere anymore. We’ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I’m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn’t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",
    "answer": "First, you’re doing so many things right. Your love, preparedness, and advocacy are clear—and it’s normal to feel shaken after witnessing a generalized seizure. Many parents develop a kind of “post‑event hypervigilance.” It’s understandable, but it’s also treatable, and there are ways to keep him safe while giving him the space to be a kid.\n\nWhat we can say about risk\n- Children with epilepsy related to a known brain injury (like a perinatal stroke) often achieve good control with medication. Many remain seizure‑free for years, though no medicine can guarantee 0% risk forever.\n- “Out‑of‑nowhere” breakthrough seizures are less common than ones linked to triggers such as missed/late doses, growth (making the dose too low for the new weight), intercurrent illness/fever, sleep deprivation, or big stressors.\n- As kids grow, doses often need adjusting. Good adherence and weight‑appropriate dosing are two of the biggest modifiable factors that reduce breakthrough risk.\n- If he remains seizure‑free for a long period (often 2+ years), some neurologists consider tapering medications after reviewing risk factors and EEG—but this is individualized.\n\nAbout Keppra (levetiracetam)\n- It’s a common, effective first‑line medicine for focal epilepsies in kids and post‑stroke epilepsy.\n- Dosing in children is weight‑based and typically adjusted over time. Your note says “2.5 mg/mL twice daily,” which may be a units mix‑up (the oral solution is usually 100 mg/mL). To be sure he’s on an appropriate dose for his weight (about 18 kg at 40 lb), please confirm the exact dose in mg and the bottle concentration with his neurologist.\n- Growth spurts are a frequent reason for dose adjustments even when everything else is stable.\n\nFever and illness\n- Fever can lower the seizure threshold in some children, but most fevers do not cause seizures. Treat fever for comfort (acetaminophen/ibuprofen as advised), keep hydrated, and prioritize sleep.\n- Having a clear illness plan and rescue medication on hand is more protective than trying to avoid all exposures indefinitely.\n\nNighttime safety and SUDEP\n- SUDEP in young children is rare, especially when generalized tonic‑clonic seizures are infrequent and medications are taken regularly.\n- The single most important SUDEP risk reducer is good seizure control and adherence.\n- Night supervision can be as simple as a basic audio monitor if that helps your peace of mind. No seizure detection device is perfect; many increase anxiety with false alarms. Choose the least intrusive setup that still lets you sleep.\n\nPractical steps that lower risk and build confidence\n- Medication:\n  - Use reminders for every dose; keep a written log if helpful.\n  - Recheck dosing with each growth change.\n  - Keep an up‑to‑date list of meds and allergies on your phone and as a printed card.\n- Seizure Action Plan:\n  - Have a written plan from his neurologist that says when to give rescue meds (e.g., seizure >3–5 minutes, or a cluster), when to call 911, and who to contact.\n  - Train all caregivers, teachers, and family. Make sure rescue meds are not expired and are accessible wherever he spends time.\n- Triggers:\n  - Prioritize adequate sleep.\n  - Avoid missed or late doses.\n  - Keep illness routines simple: fluids, rest, fever control, lower threshold for rescue if his plan says so.\n- Safety basics:\n  - Swimming: always 1:1 close, in‑arm supervision; life jacket for open water.\n  - Heights/bikes: helmet; choose settings where a brief loss of balance wouldn’t be catastrophic.\n  - Consider a simple medical ID bracelet and phone Medical ID.\n\nHelping him live like a kid again\n- Reintroduce activities in small steps with guardrails. For example:\n  - Start with short, uncrowded outdoor outings at quiet times; bring rescue meds; let one trusted adult be the designated “seizure lead.”\n  - Resume in‑person therapies with providers who understand his action plan and infection precautions.\n  - School: coordinate a 504/IEP and a seizure action plan; many children do very well in school with these supports.\n- Each successful step builds your confidence and his independence.\n\nYour anxiety and how to get your calm back\n- What you’re describing is common after a traumatic event. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or trauma‑informed therapy can be very effective for reducing the constant checking and fear while keeping appropriate safety behaviors.\n- Practical tactics:\n  - Set a gradual “checking reduction” plan at night (e.g., use an audio monitor; check at set times, then space checks out weekly).\n  - Create a written “if‑then” safety plan so your brain isn’t trying to anticipate everything 24/7.\n  - Peer support helps: Epilepsy Foundation community groups, local parent groups for CP/epilepsy, and perinatal stroke networks.\n- If your sleep, mood, or functioning are suffering, talk with your own clinician; treating parental PTSD/anxiety makes a big difference for the whole family.\n\nAnswers to your specific questions\n- Likelihood of a surprise breakthrough seizure: Not zero, but lower when doses are correct for weight, doses aren’t missed, sleep is good, and illness plans are in place. Completely unpredictable events are less common than trigger‑associated ones.\n- Will Keppra always control his seizures? It’s very encouraging that he’s doing well. Some children need dose adjustments over time; a minority need a second medication or a switch. Long‑term seizure freedom on a single medicine is common in kids with focal epilepsies who respond early.\n- How to let him be a kid: Layer safety (adherence, action plan, trained caregivers, rescue meds on hand) and then give back age‑appropriate independence in steps. The goal is “reasonable precautions,” not “zero risk,” because zero risk isn’t achievable and costs him too much.\n\nA few quick clarifying questions that would help tailor guidance\n- What is his exact levetiracetam dose in mg per dose, and what concentration is on the bottle (e.g., 100 mg/mL)? When was it last adjusted for weight?\n- What rescue medication do you have (e.g., diazepam nasal spray, midazolam nasal, rectal diazepam), and what are the instructions for when to give it?\n- When was his last seizure, and have any occurred during sleep?\n- Any known personal triggers so far (illness, missed doses, sleep loss)?\n- Does he have a current written seizure action plan for school/therapies?\n\nYou’re clearly a thoughtful, dedicated parent. With a solid plan, regular follow‑up with his pediatric neurologist, and support for your own anxiety, most families find a balance where kids stay safe and get to be kids again. If you’d like, share the dosing/rescue details and I can help you sanity‑check the plan and suggest specific questions for his neurologist.",

    "question": "I’m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6’0”) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I’m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of “blanking out” almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I’ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don’t move, so I don’t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it’s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can’t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I’m an effort to resolve this issue, I’ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn’t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that’s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I’ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I’m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that’s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn’t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I’ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don’t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’ve been dealing with this for so long. What you’re describing is real, and it’s understandable that it’s taken a toll. I’m glad you’re seeing a doctor this week.\n\nImportant first: if you feel even slightly suicidal, please tell someone you trust today and seek help now. In the U.S., call/text 988 (24/7). If outside the U.S., use your local crisis line or go to the nearest ER.\n\nWhat your symptoms might fit\nThere isn’t one single condition that explains everything, but there are several plausible, testable possibilities. More than one could be present.\n\n- Seizure-like events\n  - Absence or focal impaired-awareness seizures can feel like momentary “blanking.” A normal MRI doesn’t rule this out. You’d need an EEG (ideally prolonged/ambulatory 24–72 hr).\n- Vestibular disorders\n  - Vestibular migraine or persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) can cause “derealization,” brain fog, difficulty maintaining visual fixation, and frequent “reorienting.”\n- Eye movement/visual focusing disorder\n  - Convergence insufficiency, accommodative problems, or subtle saccadic intrusions (e.g., square-wave jerks) can make objects seem to slip out of focus every few seconds. A neuro‑ophthalmology or binocular vision (developmental) optometry exam can detect this.\n- Autonomic issues\n  - POTS/orthostatic intolerance can cause brain fog, derealization, and trouble focusing—often worse standing or after meals/exertion. Screening: orthostatic vitals; formal: tilt-table test. A heart rhythm monitor (Holter/Zio) can also rule out arrhythmias.\n- Sleep-wake disorders\n  - Severe sleep fragmentation or microsleeps, narcolepsy spectrum, or sleep apnea (even in thin people) can cause rapid “blips” in attention. Consider a sleep study if history points that way.\n- Temporomandibular disorder (TMD)/trigeminal system\n  - TMJ inflammation or disc displacement can cause ear fullness, dizziness, head pressure, and cognitive fog via trigeminal–vestibular/autonomic pathways. The fact that gentle pressure near the TMJ temporarily helps suggests a neural “gating” effect rather than changing brain blood flow. The superficial temporal artery runs there; compressing it would not meaningfully change brain perfusion.\n- Functional neurologic symptoms (network-level dysregulation)\n  - This is not “imagined.” Brain network dysfunction can cause intermittent “blanking,” derealization, and sensory integration problems and often coexists with migraine/vestibular/autonomic issues. It’s treatable with targeted rehab and therapy.\n\nWhy TMJ pressure might help\n- That area is rich in trigeminal and auricular nerves. Stimulating them can transiently modulate brainstem centers for arousal, pain, and vestibular processing—giving short-lived clarity. It’s unlikely you’re altering cerebral blood flow. Avoid hard or prolonged pressure—TMJ structures are delicate and can worsen with aggressive manipulation.\n\nWhat to take to your doctor (bring a brief symptom diary if you can)\n- Describe the episodes:\n  - Frequency (every X seconds), duration of each “blank,” continuous vs episodic, relation to posture (standing vs lying), exertion, chewing/jaw position, light/sound, sleepiness, and any associated tinnitus, ear fullness, headaches, jaw pain/clicking, neck pain, palpitations.\n- Ask about:\n  1) Neurology\n     - EEG (consider ambulatory 24–72 hr) to rule out absence/focal seizures.\n     - If palpitations or near-fainting: ECG and 1–2 week heart monitor.\n  2) Autonomic testing\n     - Orthostatic vitals in clinic; consider tilt-table test for POTS/orthostatic intolerance.\n  3) Neuro‑ophthalmology/binocular vision exam\n     - Assess for convergence insufficiency, accommodative disorder, subtle nystagmus/saccadic intrusions; eye-movement recordings if available.\n  4) Otology/vestibular (ENT or neurotologist)\n     - Vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, rotary chair) and evaluation for vestibular migraine or PPPD.\n  5) TMJ/TMD specialist (dentist with TMD focus or oral–maxillofacial surgeon)\n     - TMJ exam; consider TMJ MRI for disc displacement. Conservative care: night guard for bruxism, physical therapy targeting jaw/neck, posture and habit changes, short NSAID course if appropriate. Avoid aggressive jaw manipulation.\n  6) Sleep medicine\n     - If daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep, or possible microsleeps: polysomnography ± MSLT.\n  7) Basic labs (if not recently checked)\n     - CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate, ferritin, vitamin D; consider celiac screen if GI symptoms.\n  8) If symptoms are strongly positional or you have head pressure, pulsatile tinnitus, or visual changes\n     - Discuss venous outflow disorders (jugular issues) or IIH; consider MRV/CTV if clinically indicated. This is less likely but can be considered if red flags exist.\n\nThings to avoid\n- Repeated hard self-manipulation of the TMJ/upper neck (can worsen TMD or irritate nerves).\n- High‑velocity neck chiropractic manipulation (rare but real stroke risk; and you’ve not had benefit).\n\nWhat you can try now (safe, low risk)\n- Gentle TMJ care: soft diet, avoid wide yawns/gum, heat to jaw muscles, jaw relaxation exercises, avoid clenching; consider a professionally fitted night guard if you grind.\n- Migraine hygiene even if you’re not sure you have migraine: regular sleep/wake times, hydration, regular meals, gradual aerobic exercise, limit screen glare, manage stress.\n- Track triggers and posture effects; note if symptoms improve lying down or with jaw at rest.\n\nGo to urgent care/ER sooner if you develop any of the following\n- True loss of consciousness, new weakness/numbness, speech difficulty, double vision, severe worst headache, chest pain/palpitations with near-fainting, or if suicidal thoughts intensify.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a one-page summary to hand your doctor so your key points don’t get lost.",

    "question": "Female, 40, has a history of seizures but not since 2011, after surgery,  Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- Yes—many people “feel” a seizure inside their head. That can be a focal aware seizure (often called an aura) and may be the only symptom.\n- Seizures don’t have to “spread through the body.” Some stay localized and cause only internal sensations.\n- A normal routine EEG does not rule out seizures. Many seizures—especially brief or deep‑brain ones—won’t show on a short scalp EEG.\n- It’s possible to have a seizure you don’t notice and only feel “off” afterward (postictal symptoms), or to wake with signs that one occurred overnight.\n\nMore detail\nWhat “feeling a seizure in your head” can be\n- Focal aware seizures (auras) are seizures you remain aware of. They can feel like:\n  - A sudden rush, pressure, buzzing, or “wave” in the head (often called a cephalic aura)\n  - Déjà vu/jamais vu, sudden fear or panic\n  - Odd smells/tastes, rising sensation in the stomach, tingling, dizziness\n- These may or may not progress to visible symptoms or loss of awareness. They can last seconds to a minute or two and are often very stereotyped episode to episode.\n- Not all seizures “march” from the head to the rest of the body. “Jacksonian march” is one specific motor pattern; many seizures never do this.\n\nWhy an EEG can be normal when seizures are real\n- Timing: A routine EEG is only 20–30 minutes. If you’re not having epileptiform activity during that window, it can look normal.\n- Depth and location: Seizures starting deep (mesial temporal, insula) or very focal may be too far from the scalp electrodes to register clearly.\n- Intermittence: Between seizures, the EEG can be normal (no interictal spikes).\n- Technical/physiologic factors: Motion artifact, drowsiness vs wake state, medications, and skull/soft‑tissue “filtering” all affect what’s seen.\n- Sensitivity numbers (approximate): A single routine EEG detects epileptiform activity in only about 30–50% of people with epilepsy; repeat or sleep‑deprived EEGs increase the yield. Prolonged ambulatory EEG (24–72h) or inpatient video‑EEG monitoring is much more likely to capture events.\n\nCan you have a seizure and not realize it?\n- Yes. Focal impaired‑awareness or absence seizures can leave a gap in memory. Nocturnal seizures may be missed entirely.\n- Clues afterward (postictal period): sudden fatigue, confusion, headache, sore muscles, tongue biting, urinary incontinence, new injuries, or waking with a bitten cheek or disheveled bedding.\n- Some people only notice “I feel like I had one” because of those after‑effects.\n\nOther conditions that can feel similar\n- Migraine aura (5–60 minutes, often followed by headache, visual phenomena)\n- Panic/anxiety attacks\n- Transient ischemic events, sleep disorders, dissociative events\nA neurologist differentiates these by history, exam, and targeted testing.\n\nWhen to seek care\n- New or changing spells after years of remission (especially with a seizure history and prior surgery) warrant a check‑in with your neurologist.\n- Ask about: a repeat or sleep‑deprived EEG, ambulatory or inpatient video‑EEG monitoring, and whether any medication changes or triggers could be relevant.\n- Go to urgent care/ER if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, clusters without recovery, there’s injury, pregnancy, new neurological deficits, or unusual severe headache.\n\nPractical tips while you’re sorting this out\n- Keep a simple diary: date/time, what you felt, duration, possible triggers (sleep loss, illness, stress, alcohol), meds/supplements.\n- Review medications that can lower seizure threshold (examples: bupropion, tramadol, some fluoroquinolone antibiotics, high‑dose diphenhydramine) with your clinician.\n- Until cleared, consider safety precautions: showers instead of baths, don’t swim alone, be cautious with heights/operating machinery; follow your state’s driving rules if you think seizures are recurring.\n\nReliable resources and articles\n- Epilepsy Foundation (patient-friendly):\n  - Focal aware (simple partial) seizures: https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/seizure-types/focal-aware-seizures\n  - Auras and prodromes: https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/seizure-triggers/seizure-warnings-auras\n  - EEG testing: https://www.epilepsy.com/diagnosis/testing-and-monitoring/eeg\n- Cleveland Clinic:\n  - EEG: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4825-electroencephalography-eeg\n  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (common source of auras): https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17629-temporal-lobe-epilepsy\n- American Academy of Neurology (patient info): https://www.aan.com/patients\n- ILAE 2017 classification (how doctors name seizure types): Fisher et al., Epilepsia 2017.

    "question": "Hey all, I am a 30 yo white male. I am currently 270 pounds and 5'9. Active and fairly healthy. Meds: Keppra (1000mg x2 daily, Prozac 40mg 1x Daily, Clonazepam .5mg x2 daily, Meloxicam 15mg 1x daily, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin C Supplements) I had mono when i was 17 that developed into GBS. I had weakness, druken gate, and slurred speech and my main symptoms. Symptoms resolved in approx. 6 months and i was going back to normal. Shortly there after i started with seizures, one in November 2009, again in February 2010. I have been on Keppra since and been seizure free. I also have auto immune disease. One diagnosed, Hidradenitis Supperativa (doing well), and one undiagnosed. The undiagnosed one is more recently been bothering me.. i have Episcleritis and joint pain.. High ESR and CRP in the blood. I am worried about covid and want the vax but am afraid because i had a neurological reaction to the flu shot after my GBS. My Neurologist is insisting i get the vax and im talking to my Rheumi tomorrow. Is there anybody who can give me insight on what i should consider? Thank you!",
    "answer": "Short answer: With your history, an mRNA COVID‑19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) is generally recommended. Avoid adenoviral‑vector vaccines (like J&J) and consider avoiding Novavax if you’re especially worried about Guillain‑Barré recurrence. Overall, the risk of GBS after mRNA COVID vaccines appears no higher than background, while COVID infection itself raises the risk of GBS and severe illness—especially with your BMI and autoimmune/inflammatory history.\n\nWhy this is the usual recommendation\n- Prior GBS is not a contraindication to mRNA COVID vaccines. Large surveillance studies have not shown an increased GBS risk with mRNA vaccines; a clear signal was seen only with the J&J (adenovirus) vaccine. Novavax has had a small, uncertain signal; if you’re risk‑averse, prefer mRNA.\n- COVID infection carries a higher risk of GBS than mRNA vaccination, and your obesity and autoimmune/inflammatory issues increase your risk of severe COVID.\n- A remote GBS episode after an infection (mono/EBV) does not meaningfully raise the risk of GBS after mRNA vaccination. Recurrence after vaccines is very rare.\n\nAbout your past “neurologic reaction” to a flu shot\n- The key detail is whether you had true GBS diagnosed within 6 weeks of that flu vaccine. If yes, that’s a precaution for future influenza shots—but it still doesn’t contraindicate mRNA COVID vaccination.\n- If it was not confirmed GBS, the concern is even lower.\n\nSeizure disorder and meds\n- Levetiracetam, fluoxetine, clonazepam, meloxicam, vitamins/fish oil don’t interact with mRNA COVID vaccines. Vaccination doesn’t increase seizure risk beyond a transient fever/illness day; treat post‑vaccine fever or aches with acetaminophen. Continue your usual meds.\n\nWhat to consider/do\n- Choose: Pfizer or Moderna (current season’s updated formulation). Avoid J&J; consider avoiding Novavax if you want to minimize theoretical GBS risk.\n- Timing: Get vaccinated when your autoimmune symptoms are reasonably stable. Meloxicam is fine to continue. No need to pre‑medicate; use acetaminophen or your usual NSAID after if you feel lousy.\n- Monitoring: For 1–3 weeks after the shot, seek urgent care if you develop progressive symmetric weakness, new numbness/tingling in feet/hands that ascends, severe back pain, facial weakness, trouble swallowing, or new gait issues—symptoms that could suggest GBS. This is very unlikely, but know the signs.\n- Also be aware of rare myocarditis in young men after mRNA vaccines (usually mild, much rarer with boosters than with the second primary dose). Watch for chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations for a week; avoid unusually strenuous exercise for a few days.\n- Observation: Ask for a 30‑minute post‑shot observation period for reassurance.\n\nQuestions to ask your rheumatologist tomorrow\n- Given my prior GBS after mono and possible post‑flu‑shot reaction, do you specifically recommend Pfizer/Moderna over Novavax?\n- Any timing considerations with my episcleritis/joint symptoms or any planned immunomodulating therapy?\n- Do you expect any flare risk, and how would we manage it if it happens?\n- Any reason to adjust meloxicam around vaccination?\n\nBottom line: Based on current evidence and your risk profile, proceeding with an mRNA COVID vaccine is the safer choice than remaining unvaccinated. Your neurologist’s advice aligns with guidelines. Coordinate timing with your rheumatologist, choose Pfizer/Moderna, and monitor for the rare warning signs.",

    "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing “panic attacks” that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re both going through this. What you’re describing is frightening, and you’re not overreacting. Episodes with slurred and slowed speech, loss of balance, rapid eye movements, confusion/amnesia, fainting, and vomiting that last hours are not typical for simple panic attacks and warrant urgent neurological and medical evaluation. The fact that he’s had repeated falls and head injuries and is now having frequent episodes and suicidal thoughts makes this an emergency-priority situation.\n\nIf either of you feels he is in immediate danger of harming himself, or if he has a severe new neurological change (new weakness, severe headache, chest pain, prolonged loss of consciousness, cannot keep liquids down), call 911 right now or go to the nearest emergency department.\n\nWhy this needs more than “anxiety”\n- Panic attacks can cause intense fear, hyperventilation, and even fainting, but they do not typically cause prolonged (3–6 hour) episodes with dysarthria, ataxia, rapid nystagmus-like eye movements, and post-episode amnesia.\n- Weekly fainting with trauma and persistent vomiting are red flags.\n- A normal quick MRI and routine EEG during a calm period do not rule out many neurological or cardiac causes.\n\nPossible causes to consider (not diagnoses)\n- Seizure spectrum: focal impaired-awareness seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus; routine EEGs can miss these unless captured during an event. Video-EEG monitoring may be needed.\n- Vestibular or brainstem migraine (vestibular migraine, migraine with brainstem aura): can cause hours of vertigo/ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, vomiting, and confusion—with or without prominent headache.\n- Episodic ataxia or other channelopathies: stress/alcohol-triggered spells of ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus lasting hours; rare but treatable.\n- Cardiac/arrhythmic syncope or autonomic dysfunction: can cause fainting, confusion, vomiting; needs ECG/Holter, orthostatics, possibly echo/tilt test.\n- Toxic/metabolic or nutritional: thyroid, B12/folate, thiamine deficiency (Wernicke risk higher with poor intake and vomiting), electrolytes, glucose, liver/kidney issues.\n- Medication effects: pregabalin can cause dizziness, ataxia, slurred speech, nystagmus, confusion, and can worsen suicidal thoughts. It may be exacerbating things, even if not the original cause. Don’t stop it abruptly—discuss tapering with a clinician.\n- Functional neurological disorder or psychogenic non-epileptic events are possible, but should be a diagnosis of inclusion after appropriate neurological and medical workup.\n\nWhat to do now\n1) Go to a tertiary ER during an episode if possible, or soon if episodes are daily/frequent. Choose a hospital with neurology on site if you can. When you arrive:\n   - Use this script: “I’m having recurrent episodes lasting 3–6 hours with slurred speech, loss of balance, rapid side-to-side eye movements, vomiting, fainting, and confusion with amnesia afterward. I’ve had head injuries from falls. I’m also having suicidal thoughts. Previous MRI/EEG were normal but not done during an episode. I do not feel safe to go home. I need neurology and medical evaluation and monitoring.”\n   - Ask specifically for: neurology consult; observation until an episode occurs or admission; repeat brain MRI focused on posterior fossa with and without contrast and diffusion, and MRA/CTA head and neck; prolonged/video EEG monitoring; basic and extended labs (CBC, CMP/electrolytes, glucose, TSH, B12, folate, thiamine, magnesium, liver/kidney tests; tox screen if relevant); ECG and telemetry/Holter; orthostatic vitals; consider echocardiogram; consider vestibular assessment.\n   - Bring a written one-page timeline, full medication list (doses and start dates), substance use, and any family history. If you can, show a video of an episode.\n\n2) Between now and then\n   - No driving, swimming alone, climbing heights, or operating machinery.\n   - Avoid alcohol completely; it can worsen many of the above conditions and interact with pregabalin.\n   - Hydration, regular meals if possible; consider a daily multivitamin and thiamine (B1) supplementation is often reasonable if intake has been poor, but ask a clinician first.\n   - Do not stop pregabalin abruptly—discuss side effects and a safer plan with a doctor. It can worsen balance and cognition in some people.\n   - Record episodes (video, duration, triggers, symptoms, recovery) to show clinicians.\n   - During an episode, check and record pulse and blood pressure if you can do so safely.\n\n3) Navigating care in Quebec without a family doctor\n   - If blocked by “see your doctor,” going to the ER during an active episode with the above script and highlighting the suicidal ideation often changes the disposition and increases chances of neuro/cardiology involvement.\n   - Call Info-Santé/Info-Social 811 for guidance and to document concerns; tell them about the neurological red flags and suicidality.\n   - Register/confirm registration with the Guichet d’accès à un médecin de famille (GAMF) and ask about the Guichet d’accès à la première ligne (GAP) in your CIUSSS/CISSS for navigation.\n   - If care is repeatedly dismissed despite red flags, you can request to speak with the ER’s patient representative or the CIUSSS/CISSS complaints commissioner to facilitate appropriate referral.\n\nAbout Silexan/pregabalin\n- Silexan (lavender oil) has modest evidence for mild-moderate generalized anxiety; it is not an appropriate stand-alone treatment for what you’re describing.\n- Pregabalin can help anxiety in some, but it can also cause ataxia, dysarthria, cognitive slowing, nystagmus, and worsen suicidality in others. Given his symptoms, this merits urgent re-evaluation by a physician. Again, don’t stop it suddenly.\n\nSupport for suicidal thoughts\n- If he is in immediate danger: call 911.\n- Canada-wide 988 Suicide Crisis Helpline: call or text 988, 24/7.\n- Quebec Suicide Prevention Line: 1-866-APPELLE (277-3553), 24/7.\n- Info-Social 811 can connect you to local crisis centers.\n- If it helps, I can stay with you here while you reach out.\n\nYou’ve been doing all the right things—documenting, advocating, and seeking care. Based on the pattern and red flags, a neurologic and medical workup is appropriate and urgent. Please go back to the ER, ideally during an episode, make the safety concerns explicit, and ask for neurology and observation until the picture is clearer.",

    "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
    "answer": "Short answer: Most evidence supports what your team told you—Chiari I malformation and epilepsy usually coexist by coincidence rather than one causing the other. Chiari surgery typically does not improve seizures.\n\nWhy they’re usually unrelated\n- Epilepsy comes from abnormal electrical activity in the cerebral cortex. Chiari I involves the lower back part of the brain (cerebellar tonsils) and upper spinal canal. The circuitry that generates seizures isn’t in the region affected by Chiari.\n- In pediatric studies, seizures occur in a small minority of children with Chiari I, at rates similar to children who undergo brain MRI for other reasons. When both are present, treating the Chiari rarely changes seizure control.\n- Many Chiari I malformations are found incidentally when a child has an MRI for seizures or headaches.\n\nAbout the “15 mm” descent\n- Chiari I is typically defined as cerebellar tonsils >5 mm below the foramen magnum. So 15 mm is a sizable descent.\n- However, the number alone doesn’t predict how a child feels. Some children with large descent have no symptoms; others with smaller descent do. What matters most is whether there’s crowding/CSF flow obstruction and clinical symptoms.\n- Because 15 mm is significant, evaluation by a pediatric neurosurgeon is appropriate even if the finding was incidental.\n\nSymptoms that suggest the Chiari is clinically important\n- Occipital/neck headaches, often triggered by cough/strain/crying\n- Balance or coordination problems, frequent falls beyond what’s expected for age\n- Swallowing difficulties, gagging/choking, weak cry, hoarseness\n- Sleep-disordered breathing or pauses in breathing\n- Arm/hand weakness or numbness, scoliosis\n- Any signs of a spinal cord syrinx (often screened with a spine MRI)\n\nWhat to ask your child’s doctors\n- Was the cervical/thoracic spine imaged to look for a syrinx?\n- Is there evidence of CSF flow blockage on MRI (sometimes evaluated with a cine CSF-flow study)?\n- What symptoms should we watch for at home, and how often should we follow up?\n- If surgery is discussed, is it being recommended for Chiari-related symptoms or a syrinx (not for seizures)?\n\nEpilepsy treatment notes\n- Keppra (levetiracetam) oral solution is usually 100 mg/mL. At 1.5 mL twice daily, that’s 300 mg/day. At 35 lb (≈16 kg), that’s about 19 mg/kg/day—within the typical starting range (about 20 mg/kg/day), with common maintenance targets 20–60 mg/kg/day depending on control and side effects. Confirm the concentration on your bottle.\n- If seizures are persisting or there are behavior side effects (irritability, mood swings), discuss dose adjustments or strategies (some clinicians try vitamin B6 for Keppra-related irritability) with your pediatric neurologist.\n- Surgery for Chiari is not used to treat seizures.\n\nPractical next steps\n- Ensure you’ve had or are scheduled for a pediatric neurosurgery consultation.\n- Ask whether additional imaging (spine MRI, CSF-flow study) is indicated.\n- Keep a seizure diary and follow your neurologist’s plan; ask about a rescue medication and safety precautions (water safety, fever management, sleep).\n- Monitor for Chiari-related symptoms listed above and report any new concerns promptly.\n\nI know it feels like a striking coincidence, but in most children the two conditions are independent. The key is to treat the epilepsy based on seizure control and manage the Chiari only if it’s causing its own symptoms or complications.",

    "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’ve been dealing with this so long. Based on what you’ve described (age 24, brief episodes of diplopia lasting about 40 minutes, prodrome of slight disorientation 5–10 minutes before, coherence preserved, sometimes worse with movement and clearly better if one eye is covered on at least some episodes), the main possibilities to consider are:\n\nMost likely possibilities\n- Migraine aura (including “migraine with brainstem aura”) without headache\n  - Auras typically last 5–60 minutes, can include diplopia, disorientation/dizziness, and can occur without any head pain. Brain imaging and EEG are usually normal between attacks.\n  - The 40-minute duration and reproducible prodrome are classic for aura.\n- Intermittent binocular misalignment (decompensated phoria/strabismus)\n  - Latent eye misalignment can “break down” intermittently, especially with fatigue, illness, stress, dim light, or prolonged near work. In dimmer months (Sept–Apr), fewer visual cues and more fatigue/illness can make fusion harder.\n  - Diplopia resolves immediately when either eye is covered. Separation often varies with gaze direction and distance.\n  - Treatable with precise glasses prescription, prisms, or targeted vision therapy (orthoptics).\n- Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG)\n  - Causes fluctuating diplopia (and/or ptosis) that can come and go, vary with fatigue, and leave normal imaging. Can be misdiagnosed for years.\n  - Testing: AChR and MuSK antibodies (and LRP4 where available), single-fiber EMG if antibodies negative. Exam during an attack is most helpful.\n\nLess likely but worth keeping in mind\n- Thyroid eye disease (can be euthyroid): variable diplopia, usually with other eye signs.\n- Episodic ataxia type 2 or vestibular migraine: can include vertigo/diplopia, but attacks are usually longer and have other features.\n- TIA/vascular causes are very unlikely at your age with a 5-year stable pattern and normal workups, but any new persistent neuro deficits would change that.\n\nAbout the “monocular vs binocular” point\n- If the doubling disappears as soon as either eye is covered, that’s binocular diplopia (misalignment) and points away from cornea/lens problems.\n- If doubling persists when only one eye is open, that’s monocular diplopia (usually an eye/optics issue like dry eye, astigmatism, lens/tear film). True monocular diplopia in both eyes is uncommon. Mis-testing (not fully covering an eye) can cause confusion, so it’s worth re-checking carefully during an attack.\n\nWhat I would do next\n- Try to be seen during an attack\n  - If you can, go to urgent care, an optometrist with binocular vision/orthoptics experience, or a neuro‑ophthalmology clinic while symptomatic. A real‑time eye alignment exam is often decisive.\n  - Record a short video of your eyes in primary gaze and looking up/down/left/right during an attack; note any eyelid droop. Bring that to your visit.\n- Simple at-home checks during an episode\n  - Cover-uncover: Cover one eye completely. If doubling vanishes immediately, it’s binocular. Note which gaze direction makes it worst and how far apart the images are.\n  - Look for ptosis: Hold up-gaze for 60–90 seconds and watch for one eyelid to droop (fatigability suggests OMG). If ptosis appears, try a 2-minute ice pack on the lid; improvement supports OMG.\n- Ask your PCP to order targeted tests (usually cheaper than a specialty visit)\n  - For migraine/brainstem aura: no specific test, but normal MRI is reassuring.\n  - For OMG: AChR binding/blocking/modulating antibodies, MuSK antibodies; thyroid panel (TSH, free T4; consider TSI/TSH‑receptor antibodies); consider referral for single‑fiber EMG if antibodies negative but suspicion remains.\n  - For the recurrent peripheral neuropathy: CBC, CMP, fasting glucose and HbA1c, B12 with methylmalonic acid, folate, TSH, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, B6 level (excess B6 can cause neuropathy), consider celiac serologies; HIV and syphilis testing as appropriate. Review meds/supplements (including B6) and alcohol intake.\n\nManagement ideas you can try now\n- If migraine aura is suspected:\n  - Keep a diary (sleep, stress, illness, screens, skipped meals, alcohol, dehydration). Auras often cluster with stress/illness and in darker months.\n  - Consider preventives with good safety profiles: magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg/day, riboflavin (B2) 400 mg/day, regular sleep/meals/hydration, limit alcohol, manage stress.\n  - If you develop painful headaches, discuss non-vasoconstrictive acute options (gepants or lasmiditan). Traditional triptans have historically been cautioned in brainstem aura.\n- If decompensated phoria/strabismus is suspected:\n  - Get a refraction and binocular vision assessment by an optometrist experienced in orthoptics; prisms or vision therapy can be very effective and less costly than neurology.\n  - In dim environments or during an attack, temporarily patching one eye or using an occlusive contact/spot patch can stop the dizziness from double vision.\n- If OMG is suspected:\n  - Avoid overheating and extreme fatigue; note whether symptoms worsen as the day goes on.\n  - Bring photos/videos to a neuro‑ophthalmologist. Treatment ranges from pyridostigmine to immunotherapy depending on severity.\n\nRed flags: seek urgent care/ER if\n- New constant diplopia that does not remit, new severe headache, facial droop, slurred speech, limb weakness/numbness, trouble walking, new unequal pupils, eye pain with movement, or symptoms lasting longer than 60 minutes or occurring with loss of consciousness.\n\nAbout your concussion/benzo history\n- Old minor concussions usually don’t cause brief, stereotyped 40‑minute diplopia episodes years later.\n- The benzo overdose with short memory issues is unlikely to explain a 5‑year pattern of transient diplopia.\n\nCost‑conscious pathway\n- Ask your PCP for: antibody labs for OMG, thyroid panel, and the neuropathy lab set above.\n- See an optometrist with binocular vision/orthoptics expertise first; if they find a treatable binocular vision problem, you may avoid a neurology visit.\n- If labs or eye exam point to OMG or if symptoms escalate, then a neuro‑ophthalmology referral is the most targeted specialty to see.\n\nIf you can share: whether you ever notice eyelid droop, time-of-day pattern, triggers (illness, lack of sleep, screens), and whether careful cover testing confirms binocular diplopia every time. That would help narrow this further.",

    "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—there are purpose‑built “body‑weight support” gait trainers and fall‑arrest systems with harnesses that can support 250 lb and prevent a full collapse. They’re very different from standard walkers and much safer than any DIY “bungee” setup.\n\nWhat to look for (device types and examples):\n- Mobile body‑weight–support gait trainers (with harness)\n  - Rifton TRAM: transfer and ambulation device with pelvic/torso support and harness; safe working load up to about 350 lb. Designed to keep someone upright during sudden loss of support. Can be used indoors and on smooth outdoor surfaces with a trained helper.\n  - Rifton Dynamic Pacer (XL): modular gait trainer with dynamic suspension and harness; XL model supports up to about 275 lb.\n  - LiteGait (Mobility Research): mobile body‑weight support frame with trunk/hip harness; adult models support 300–500 lb; commonly used in clinics but there are over‑ground/home versions.\n  - Meywalk 4 (adult sizes) or Drive Trekker Gait Trainer (adult): offer trunk/pelvic supports and optional harness; check exact weight limits for the specific size/config.\n- Overhead track systems for home fall‑arrest walking\n  - Ceiling or freestanding gantry with walking harness: Solo‑Step, Handicare/Prism Medical/Arjo, SureHands, Aretech/Vector. These provide true fall arrest and are safest for uncontrolled fainting/seizures, but are for indoor/home routes and require installation or a freestanding frame.\n\nImportant safety notes:\n- Do not attach a harness to a regular walker or try a DIY “bungee” solution. Standard walkers are not fall‑arrest anchors and can tip, causing worse injury. True fall‑arrest uses rated anchors and energy‑absorbing lanyards/harnesses.\n- Pick equipment with a weight rating comfortably above his body weight, sized harness, anti‑tip casters, and caregiver brakes. Get hands‑on training.\n- For outdoor walks, even the best mobile gait trainers require flat, predictable surfaces and close supervision; many families use these indoors and use a wheelchair outdoors until spells are controlled.\n\nNext steps to get the right device:\n- Ask his primary clinician for urgent evaluation of the “faint spells” (neurology for seizures; cardiology for syncope/arrhythmia). Until the cause is addressed, treat him as very high fall risk.\n- Request referral to a neuro/rehab physical therapist. PTs can trial these devices in clinic, match the right model/size, train your family, and write a letter of medical necessity.\n- Work with a reputable rehab/DME vendor to demo devices like Rifton TRAM/Dynamic Pacer or LiteGait and confirm fit and weight capacity. Insurance sometimes helps with coverage when medically justified.\n- Consider interim protective measures: seizure/impact helmet, knee/elbow pads, hip protectors, supervised routes, and a plan for safe lifting after a fall (e.g., IndeeLift patient lift).\n\nWeight‑loss and safer exercise while you sort this out:\n- Prioritize activities that don’t require standing balance: recumbent stationary bike, NuStep/seated stepper, arm ergometer, seated resistance training. Aquatic therapy only with direct, hands‑on supervision and medical clearance if seizures are possible.\n- Ask his clinician about referral to a dietitian. If he’s an adolescent or adult with obesity, there may be evidence‑based medical weight‑management options to discuss.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me his approximate age, height/weight, and where you live; I can help you find nearby clinics or vendors who can set up a trial of these systems.",

    "question": "26f. 122lbs, 5'2\". Never smoker, rare drinker. On medication (trokendi, fycompa, Yaz, pristiq, creon, Cymbalta, b12 injections, pepsid, abilify). History of epilepsy, migraines, chronic pancreatitis status post tp/ait.Went to ED for abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that was unremitting for weeks. Had abdominal CT that found incidental liver lesions. Followed up with an MRI with contrast. The below are the findings in my liver. Hpw should I interpret? Is it something to worry about?\"There are multiple (at least 7) arterially enhancing lesions in both lobes of liver, which are hyperintense on T2 and without internal fat. The dominant lesion measures 1.8 cm and seen in segment 6 of the right lobe (29:67). A few other prominent lesions include 6 mm segment 6 (29:47), 8 mm segment 5 (29:40), and 3 mm segment 2 (29:30). No definite washout however the lesions appear to enhance less then background vessels on delayed phases, arguing against hemangioma.Multiple arterially enhancing lesions in both lobes of liver, largest measuring up to 1.8 cm in segment 6 of the right lobe. Imaging features suggest adenoma with the differential including focal nodular hyperplasia.\"",
    "answer": "Short answer: These MRI findings most likely represent benign liver lesions. In a 26-year-old woman on an estrogen-containing birth control pill (Yaz), the leading consideration is hepatic adenomas; focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the main alternative. With your largest lesion only 1.8 cm, this is not an emergency, but it does warrant follow-up and a few management steps.\n\nWhat the report means\n- “Multiple arterially enhancing lesions…hyperintense on T2…no internal fat…no definite washout”: These are small spots that light up early after contrast and are a bit bright on T2. This pattern fits best with hepatic adenomas or FNH. Hemangiomas are less likely based on the delayed-phase behavior described.\n- Size and number: You have at least seven lesions, the largest 1.8 cm. Complications from adenomas (bleeding or cancerous change) are uncommon at this size; risk rises mainly when lesions are larger than 5 cm or during pregnancy.\n\nAdenoma vs FNH (why it matters)\n- Hepatic adenoma:\n  - Often linked to estrogen exposure (combined oral contraceptives).\n  - Can grow, bleed (risk increases >5 cm), and rarely transform to cancer (overall low; higher in certain subtypes).\n  - Frequently shrink or stabilize after stopping estrogen.\n- FNH:\n  - Benign, not precancerous, typically requires no treatment once diagnosis is secure.\n  - Usually not influenced by hormones.\n\nNext steps I’d recommend\n1. Stop estrogen-containing contraception now, pending clarification.\n   - Switch to a non-estrogen method (e.g., copper IUD or levonorgestrel IUD). Avoid combined pills, patches, rings. Discuss options with your gynecologist, especially given your seizure meds.\n2. Clarify the diagnosis with the best imaging:\n   - Ask if your MRI used a hepatobiliary-specific contrast agent (gadoxetate/Eovist). If not, a repeat MRI with Eovist or a contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can usually distinguish adenoma from FNH without biopsy.\n3. Hepatology referral:\n   - A liver specialist can coordinate imaging, decide if biopsy is needed (often not for lesions <2 cm if imaging is characteristic), and set a follow-up plan.\n4. Follow-up imaging:\n   - If adenomas are confirmed and you stop estrogen, repeat imaging in about 6 months to check for shrinkage, then yearly if stable. Intervention is generally considered if any lesion grows toward or beyond 5 cm, shows concerning features, or causes symptoms.\n5. Labs:\n   - Basic liver panel; sometimes AFP is checked. If inflammatory adenoma is suspected, CRP/GGT may be relevant, but imaging usually guides care.\n6. Pregnancy planning:\n   - If adenomas are present, plan ahead with your hepatologist/OB. Small (<5 cm) adenomas can often be monitored during pregnancy, but growth risk is higher during pregnancy, so pre-pregnancy counseling is important. FNH is generally safe in pregnancy.\n\nWhat to watch for\n- Go to the ER urgently if you develop sudden severe right upper abdominal pain, shoulder-tip pain, dizziness/fainting, or a drop in blood pressure—these could be signs of bleeding from a liver lesion (rare at your sizes, but important to know).\n\nLikely relation to your symptoms\n- These small liver lesions are unlikely to be the cause of your recent prolonged nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain; they were likely found incidentally. Your pancreatitis history and GI issues are more probable contributors to those symptoms.\n\nWhy your current meds matter\n- Yaz (estrogen) can promote adenoma growth—stopping is advised until lesions are fully characterized.\n- Your antiepileptics don’t cause these lesions, but some can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal birth control—another reason to review contraception with your clinicians.\n\nIf you can, please share:\n- Whether your MRI included a “hepatobiliary phase” (Eovist).\n- Any prior liver imaging for comparison.\n- Pregnancy plans in the near future.\n\nBottom line: This is probably a benign finding, with hepatic adenomas slightly more likely than FNH given your OCP use. It’s not an emergency, but you should stop estrogen now, see hepatology, get definitive imaging characterization, and arrange surveillance. The risk of serious complications at 1.8 cm is low.",

    "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
    "answer": "I’m very sorry for your loss and for how frightening this has been. I’ll keep this focused and practical.\n\nBottom line\n- Yes—she remains at some risk for more seizures until the cause is clarified and she has been seizure‑free for longer. The new brief right‑sided “vibrations/shakes” could be focal seizures, but they can also be benign sleep jerks. Light sensitivity and blurry vision may be medication side effects or migraine; rarely they are seizure auras.\n- Several of her symptoms fit phenytoin side effects. The new, generalized itching 4–6 weeks after starting phenytoin is particularly concerning for a drug reaction that can become serious.\n\nWhy I’m concerned about the itching\n- Phenytoin can cause allergic/hypersensitivity reactions 2–8 weeks after starting (itching, rash), which can progress to DRESS or Stevens‑Johnson syndrome.\n- Seek urgent care now if she has any of the following: new rash (even faint), hives, fever, facial swelling, mouth sores, eye redness, sore throat, swollen glands, shortness of breath, dark urine, jaundice, severe fatigue, or easy bruising/bleeding. If those appear, go to the ER and do not take another dose on the way.\n- Even without a visible rash, generalized itching that disrupts sleep deserves prompt review and blood tests.\n\nWhat to do next (within 24–48 hours, sooner if worsening)\n- Call her neurologist (or go to urgent care if you can’t reach them) and report:\n  - Generalized itching\n  - Light sensitivity, intermittent blurry vision\n  - Excessive sleepiness\n  - Brief right‑sided “vibration/shaking” spells during sleep\n- Ask for:\n  - Phenytoin levels (total and, if available, free level)\n  - CBC with differential, liver panel (AST/ALT, bilirubin), kidney tests\n  - Consider switching from phenytoin to a better‑tolerated antiseizure medicine (levetiracetam is commonly used postpartum and has fewer skin reactions; lamotrigine is another option but needs slow titration)\n  - An EEG (preferably with sleep and photic stimulation) to look for seizure tendency\n  - Review of her prior MRI; if not already done, consider MR venography to rule out cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (a postpartum cause of headache and seizures)\n- Check her blood pressure at home twice daily for a few days and report if ≥140/90 or if she has severe headache, visual changes, or right‑upper‑abdominal pain. Late postpartum eclampsia/PRES can present after delivery even without classic symptoms at first.\n\nAbout seizure risk\n- After multiple seizures with an MRI change and uncertain cause, recurrence risk is not zero. Reducing phenytoin may lower protection if levels become subtherapeutic.\n- Being seizure‑free for only 4–6 weeks is early to taper without a clear reversible cause. This is why reassessment and levels are important.\n\nSafety until cleared by her doctor\n- No driving, swimming alone, bathing in a tub, climbing ladders, or operating dangerous machinery.\n- Prioritize regular sleep; avoid alcohol and dehydration; don’t miss doses.\n- Seizure first aid: if a convulsive seizure occurs, time it, protect her head, roll onto her side, don’t put anything in her mouth. Call emergency services if it lasts >5 minutes, clusters back‑to‑back, breathing/awareness doesn’t recover, or she’s injured or pregnant.\n- Ask her doctor about a rescue medication (e.g., intranasal midazolam) to use for a seizure lasting >3–5 minutes.\n\nAbout the “bed vibrating” and brief right‑sided shakes\n- Hypnic jerks or periodic limb movements during sleep are common and can feel like a jolt or “vibration” for a second or two. Focal seizures usually last longer (tens of seconds), may march/spread, and can be followed by confusion or weakness.\n- If possible, video one of these spells on your phone to show her neurologist.\n\nIs this multiple sclerosis?\n- MS is very unlikely here. MS usually shows characteristic MRI lesions and causes sensory/vision problems over days to weeks, not sudden generalized seizures postpartum. Itching alone is not a typical MS sign.\n\nSpinal anesthesia as a cause?\n- Seizures several days later are not typical from spinal anesthesia itself. Postpartum causes like eclampsia/PRES, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or less often infection/bleed are more common, and it sounds like much was checked—just make sure venous thrombosis was specifically ruled out (MRV/CTV).\n\nEmotional support\n- After a stillbirth and ICU stay, anxiety, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance are very common—for both partners. Consider asking your care team for grief and mental‑health support.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether she has any rash/fever/sores or eye redness now\n- Her current blood pressure and any lab results\n- Whether an EEG or MRV was done\n\n…I can help you think through urgency and next steps.",

    "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",
    "answer": "What you describe—sudden wave/“shiver,” hard‑to‑name dread/deja vu, hyperawareness, brief difficulty talking/writing, then a short-lived headache and a “floaty”/dizzy feeling—sounds quite compatible with focal aware seizures, most often from the temporal lobe. These can be very brief (seconds to under 2 minutes), feel intensely “real,” and leave a mild post‑episode headache or wooziness. Other possibilities include:\n- Vestibular migraine (can cause dizziness for minutes to hours, often with migraine features or motion sensitivity).\n- Panic/derealization episodes (usually last longer, often with fast heart rate/breathing, tingling, and clear anxiety).\n- Less likely: blood sugar drops, heart rhythm issues, POTS/dysautonomia, or functional neurologic episodes.\n\nWhat to do right now\n- Sit or lie down until the dizziness passes. Hydrate. Avoid driving, heights, swimming, or operating machinery today.\n- If you can, note the exact start/stop times and what you felt. If someone is with you, ask if you seemed to stare or made automatic movements (lip smacking, hand picking).\n\nWhen to seek care\n- Make an appointment with your primary care clinician or a neurologist in the near term. Because these events are recurrent and stereotyped, an evaluation is warranted.\n- Ask about: brain MRI (epilepsy protocol) and an EEG (sometimes ambulatory), basic labs (glucose, electrolytes), and an EKG. These help distinguish seizure from migraine, panic, or cardiac causes.\n\nSafety until evaluated\n- Avoid driving until you’ve been assessed—if these are seizures, driving restrictions usually apply.\n- Prefer showers over baths; don’t swim alone; be cautious on ladders/heights; limit alcohol; prioritize sleep.\n\nTrack and capture\n- Keep a brief diary: date/time, duration, triggers (stress, sleep loss, alcohol, dehydration, illness), relation to periods, any smells/tastes/nausea or a “rising” stomach feeling, awareness/memory changes.\n- If safe, have someone record a short video during an event—very helpful for diagnosis.\n\nGo to urgent care/ER now if any of these occur\n- New or worsening severe headache, fever/stiff neck, head injury, pregnancy, chest pain/palpitations, fainting, weakness/numbness, trouble speaking/seeing, confusion lasting >15 minutes, a convulsive seizure, a single event lasting >5 minutes, or repeated events close together.\n\nA few quick questions that will help your doctor\n- Are the episodes very similar each time and under ~2 minutes?\n- Any “rising” feeling from the stomach, odd smells/tastes, or involuntary mouth/hand movements?\n- Do you ever lose time or have memory gaps?\n- Any witnesses who’ve noticed staring or unresponsiveness?\n- Triggers: sleep deprivation, alcohol, stress, illness, flashing lights, relation to your cycle?\n- Personal/family history of seizures or migraines, prior head injury?\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you summarize your episode history in a note to bring to your appointment.",

    "question": "I’m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn’t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn’t actually true- I hadn’t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine…but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn’t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I’d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn’t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I’d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents. They're in French which isn't my first language so I'll TRY to translate but will include the original French (unless it's obvious) to be safer. Thank you!!

    "answer": "Short answer\nWhat you describe fits Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME): years of myoclonic jerks (often worse with sleep loss), then a generalized tonic‑clonic seizure. In JME, routine EEGs are often normal, stopping antiseizure meds has a high relapse risk, sleep deprivation is a major trigger, and lamotrigine can worsen myoclonus. Things “went downhill” because you (1) have a syndrome that usually needs lifelong treatment, (2) had sleep deprivation, and (3) were abruptly under‑treated when levetiracetam was stopped and replaced with a very low dose of lamotrigine—exactly the scenario that can cause myoclonic clusters. Ongoing anxiety/poor sleep further lower seizure threshold.\n\nYour EEGs (translation)\n- “Rythme alpha 9 Hz, symétrique, réaction d’arrêt normale”: normal background and normal reactivity.\n- “Rhythmes rapides bifrontaux non réactifs”: nonspecific fast activity.\n- “Paroxysmes: absents”: no definite epileptiform discharges.\n- “Foyer de ralentissement fronto‑temporal bilatéral intermittent”: intermittent bilateral fronto‑temporal slowing—nonspecific (can be from drowsiness, recent seizures, meds). \nBottom line: no epileptiform spikes on those studies, but that does not rule out epilepsy—routine EEG only catches epileptiform activity in about half of people with epilepsy.\n\nWhy the relapse and persistent myoclonus\n- JME typically relapses after stopping meds; many people need lifelong therapy.\n- Sleep deprivation is a classic trigger.\n- Levetiracetam (Keppra) helps myoclonus; lamotrigine often helps tonic‑clonics but can worsen myoclonic seizures, especially if used alone or at low dose.\n- Abruptly stopping Keppra and substituting lamotrigine 25 mg (subtherapeutic) likely precipitated the clusters you had.\n- Anxiety/insomnia further lower seizure threshold. High‑dose Keppra can aggravate mood in some; that can create a vicious cycle.\n\nWhat to discuss with an epileptologist now\n- Diagnosis: Your history is highly suggestive of JME. Ask for confirmation and a written plan.\n- EEG: Consider a sleep‑deprived, prolonged ambulatory, or video‑EEG to capture jerks; routine EEGs can be normal in JME.\n- Meds optimization:\n  - Levetiracetam: You’re on 1000 mg AM + 1000 mg PM (2000 mg/day). Many adults need 2000–3000 mg/day for myoclonus; dose can be adjusted if tolerated.\n  - Consider switching from levetiracetam to brivaracetam if mood side‑effects are significant; similar efficacy with fewer behavioral issues for many.\n  - Strongly consider stopping lamotrigine if it’s worsening myoclonus (common in JME), unless there’s a clear reason to keep it.\n  - Valproate is the most effective single drug for JME (myoclonus, absences, and tonic‑clonics), but it’s highly teratogenic and can cause weight gain/PCOS; it’s generally avoided in women of childbearing potential unless no good alternative and only with reliable contraception and informed consent.\n  - Other options sometimes used: topiramate or zonisamide; clonazepam or clobazam mainly as adjuncts (watch for tolerance/sedation).\n  - If staying on levetiracetam, ask about adding vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50–100 mg/day to help mood/irritability.\n- Rescue plan:\n  - A clear plan for clusters: e.g., a small dose of clonazepam/clobazam at bedtime when jerks flare, and a take‑home rescue med (intranasal midazolam or diazepam) for prolonged events—so you’re not left “begging for meds.”\n- Sleep and triggers:\n  - Rigid sleep schedule, no all‑nighters, manage stress/anxiety, avoid binge drinking. Track menstrual cycle—some have catamenial worsening.\n- Mental health:\n  - Treat depression/anxiety—this will improve seizure control and quality of life. If starting antidepressants, avoid bupropion; SSRIs/SNRIs are generally safe. Consider CBT‑I for insomnia.\n- Safety:\n  - Don’t drive until your neurologist clears you per local rules. Avoid swimming alone, heights, open flames. Share a seizure first‑aid plan with someone you trust.\n\nAbout the lamotrigine/Keppra switch\n- Cross‑titrations must be planned; lamotrigine needs slow upward titration over weeks, and 25 mg/day is a starter dose, not therapeutic. Abruptly stopping Keppra and replacing it with 25 mg lamotrigine left you under‑treated and likely worsened myoclonus—your experience sadly makes sense pharmacologically.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Book an appointment with an epilepsy specialist to confirm JME and adjust meds (possibly increase levetiracetam or switch to brivaracetam, and consider tapering off lamotrigine).\n- Keep a brief seizure/sleep/menstrual log for the next 4–6 weeks; bring it to the visit.\n- Prioritize consistent 7–9 hours sleep; limit alcohol; manage stress.\n- Ask for a written rescue plan and consider vitamin B6 if mood issues on levetiracetam.\n\nYou did nothing wrong—this was a high‑risk medication change in a syndrome where normal EEGs can be misleading. With the right plan, JME is usually very controllable.\n\nUrgent care now if: seizures cluster without recovery, any convulsion lasts >5 minutes, repeated convulsions within an hour, or new focal weakness or injury.",

    "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",
    "answer": "I can’t diagnose you, but what you describe fits very closely with migraine with aura (sensory and language aura), and possibly a hemiplegic-migraine variant if any weakness ever occurs.\n\nWhy migraine with aura fits:\n- The symptoms “march” from the hand/arm to the face/tongue on one side, which is classic for sensory aura as the activity spreads across the sensory cortex.\n- Exactly half the face/tongue/arm going numb, intense light and sound sensitivity, a bad headache lasting hours, and temporary trouble speaking (aphasia) with intact thinking are all very typical for migraine with aura.\n- Temporary vision loss for ~15 minutes can be visual aura.\n- Episodes start in early adolescence and recur with normal imaging between attacks.\n\nOther possibilities doctors consider:\n- Focal (partial) seizures with postictal symptoms – usually much shorter sensory spells, and not commonly followed by a migraine-like headache; an EEG helps if this is suspected.\n- Transient ischemia/stroke is unlikely at your age but any new/worst episode with weakness must be treated urgently until ruled out.\n- Less commonly: hemiplegic migraine (if there is true weakness), migraine with brainstem aura, or rare metabolic/genetic causes.\n\nWhat to do next\n- See a pediatric neurologist or a headache specialist. Bring a parent/guardian and any prior records (MRI report). Ask about “migraine with aura” versus “hemiplegic migraine.”\n- Keep a detailed episode diary: timing, how the symptoms spread, duration of numbness/speech trouble/vision changes, headache duration, any triggers (sleep loss, hunger, dehydration, stress, sensory overload, illness, menstruation), and what helps.\n- If you’ve never had a recent brain MRI/MRA since these began, a neurologist may repeat imaging. If seizure is a concern, they may order an EEG.\n\nRed flags – seek urgent care or ER now if any of these happen:\n- New or persistent weakness on one side, facial droop, slurred or incoherent speech that doesn’t improve within 60 minutes, or confusion you don’t quickly recover from.\n- “Worst headache of your life,” sudden explosive (thunderclap) onset, head injury, fever/stiff neck, new seizure, or vision loss in one eye.\n- A big change in your usual pattern (much longer, more frequent, different symptoms).\n\nHow to manage at home (discuss with your clinician)\n- Treat early: As soon as the aura starts, go to a dark, quiet place. Hydrate. Use an NSAID or acetaminophen at the first sign (typical adolescent dosing: ibuprofen 10 mg/kg up to 600 mg; naproxen up to 440–500 mg; acetaminophen 15 mg/kg up to 1,000 mg; don’t combine NSAIDs). Early treatment works better than waiting.\n- Antinausea medicine: If nausea is an issue, ask your doctor about ondansetron or metoclopramide.\n- Triptans: Some are approved for teens, but they’re usually avoided in hemiplegic or brainstem aura until a specialist okays them. Don’t start these without a neurologist’s guidance.\n- Prevention: Regular sleep, regular meals, good hydration, consistent caffeine (or none), manage sensory overload and stress, limit long screen exposure and loud/bright environments when you feel prodrome symptoms coming on.\n- Supplements sometimes used for prevention (discuss first with your doctor/parent): magnesium glycinate or citrate up to 300–400 mg nightly, riboflavin (vitamin B2) 200–400 mg daily, CoQ10 100–200 mg daily. These are generally well-tolerated but still worth medical approval.\n- School plan: Ask for a note/504 plan. Keep water access, permission to rest in a dark room, and to take meds early. Consider carrying a brief card: “I may have a migraine aura. I can understand you but might not be able to speak. Please minimize light/noise and contact [parent/guardian].”\n\nImportant notes\n- If you ever notice one-sided weakness (not just numbness), tell your doctor—this raises the possibility of hemiplegic migraine and changes treatment choices.\n- If you consider birth control in the future and you do have migraine with aura, avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives; ask about progestin-only methods.\n- Anxiety and hyperventilation can worsen sensations; your breathing exercises helping a bit is common—keep using them, but start acute treatment early too.\n\nA few questions to prepare for your neurology visit:\n- Do you ever have actual weakness on that side (arm or leg feels heavy/can’t lift)?\n- Is the vision loss in one eye or both? Do you see zigzags/shimmering or is it just blank/dark?\n- How long do the numbness and speech problems last before the headache?\n- Any family history of migraines or similar spells?\n- Any link with periods, missed meals, dehydration, heat, stress, or sleep changes?\n\nIf you want, share answers to those questions and I can help you frame what to bring to the appointment and a simple action plan you can hand to school.",

    "question": "Age, sex: 23M Height: 5'7\" Weight 80kgs Current medications: Glyciphaige SR500 for pre-diabetes, LN Bloc 20 and Moxovas 0.3 for High BP, Thyrox 62.5 for Hypothyroid.Okay so recently i was at a neuro to check if i have Myoclonic Epilepsy. I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",
    "answer": "Short answer: No—being given clonazepam doesn’t mean your doctor thinks you have epilepsy. Clonazepam is commonly used for several kinds of involuntary jerks (tics, myoclonus), anxiety, and as a rescue med; its use here doesn’t imply a hidden epilepsy diagnosis.\n\nContext and next steps:\n- A normal routine EEG lowers the chance of epilepsy but doesn’t rule it out (a single routine EEG catches only a portion of cases). If your jerks continue, worsen, or have seizure-like features, ask your neurologist about a sleep‑deprived EEG, ambulatory/video EEG (24–72 hours), or inpatient video‑EEG to capture an event.\n- Helpful data: keep a diary and phone videos of spells (what you’re doing, whether you feel an urge before it, can suppress it, awareness during/after, time of day).\n\nClues that suggest tics over epileptic myoclonus:\n- There’s often a premonitory urge, partial suppressibility, and relief after the movement; they fluctuate with stress and can lessen with distraction.\nClues that suggest epileptic myoclonus/seizure:\n- Jerks mainly right after waking; clusters with sleep loss or alcohol; loss of awareness, tongue biting (side of tongue), injury, urinary incontinence, post‑event confusion, or evolution to a full convulsion.\n\nMedications you were prescribed:\n- Tetrabenazine: can help with hyperkinetic movements/tics. Watch for low mood, depression, sleepiness, parkinsonian symptoms (slowness, stiffness), or dizziness on standing. Report mood changes promptly.\n- Clonidine (for ADHD/tics): can lower blood pressure and cause sedation. Do not stop abruptly (rebound high BP).\n- Clonazepam 0.25 mg “as needed”: can reduce clusters of jerks and anxiety; it also treats myoclonic seizures, but it’s equally used for tics. Use sparingly; it can cause drowsiness, impaired coordination, and dependence. Avoid alcohol and driving after taking it.\n\nImportant with your current meds and conditions:\n- You’re already on antihypertensives (LN Bloc 20 and Moxovas 0.3). Adding clonidine may increase the risk of low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting—especially when standing. Monitor home BP and pulse, rise slowly from sitting/lying, and tell your doctor if you feel dizzy or weak.\n- Tetrabenazine can also cause orthostatic dizziness—another reason to monitor BP.\n- Ensure your thyroid dose keeps TSH in range; too much or too little thyroid hormone can worsen tremor/anxiety/jerkiness.\n\nSafety until things are clearer:\n- Prioritize good sleep, avoid binge alcohol, and limit excessive caffeine—these can trigger both tics and myoclonic jerks.\n- If you have spells that could compromise safety, be cautious with swimming alone, heights, or operating machinery. Discuss driving with your clinician if events are sudden and not yet controlled.\n\nConsider asking your neurologist:\n- Do my events look more like tics, functional movements, or myoclonus?\n- Should we do a sleep‑deprived or prolonged video/ambulatory EEG to capture an episode?\n- Do I need a brain MRI or lab work (electrolytes, liver/kidney, calcium/magnesium, TSH) if not already done?\n- Is clonidine safe alongside my current BP meds (Moxovas, LN Bloc), and how should I monitor BP at home?\n\nIf you can, share:\n- Are the jerks suppressible? Do you feel an urge before them?\n- Do they cluster in the morning after poor sleep?\n- Any loss of awareness, injuries, or post‑event confusion?\n\nBottom line: Your current plan is reasonable for suspected tics/ADHD. Clonazepam’s use here isn’t evidence of “missed epilepsy,” but if concerning features are present or symptoms persist, ask for prolonged EEG monitoring to be sure.",

    "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
    "answer": "Short answer: don’t push through this without looping your prescriber in. Air-hunger/“can’t quite get a full breath” can be a stimulant side effect (often from increased anxiety/overbreathing), but new shortness of breath also needs a safety check. It’s reasonable to pause dose escalation or even skip the next dose and message your psychiatrist today to discuss dose adjustment.\n\nWhy this can happen:\n- Stimulants (including Vyvanse) increase sympathetic tone and can trigger “sighing dyspnea”/air hunger and yawning, especially early on or with anxiety.\n- Sertraline + stimulants can amplify jitteriness/anxiety; nausea is also common.\n- Much less commonly, shortness of breath can signal an allergic reaction or heart issue, which is why monitoring is important.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Don’t increase the dose. If the sensation is moderate or worse, consider skipping the next dose and contact your prescriber.\n- Take Vyvanse after a real breakfast, not on an empty stomach; aim for protein and fluids.\n- Avoid other stimulants: caffeine/energy drinks, nicotine, decongestants (pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine), and THC.\n- Hydrate well; consider an electrolyte drink if you’re peeing frequently or feel dry.\n- Breathing resets (2–5 minutes as needed, several times/day):\n  - Pursed-lip breathing: inhale gently through your nose 4 seconds, exhale through pursed lips 6–8 seconds. Keep the exhale longer than the inhale.\n  - Diaphragmatic breathing: one hand on chest, one on belly; let the belly rise on inhale, fall on exhale.\n  - Gentle “physiologic sigh”: two small inhales through the nose (second shorter) followed by a long, relaxed exhale. Use sparingly if it provokes nausea.\n- Posture/movement: open up the chest (shoulder rolls, gentle walk) and avoid breath-holding or forceful yawns that make you nauseated.\n- Track vitals and timing: check resting heart rate and, if possible, blood pressure 1–3 hours after dosing. Note when the air hunger starts, peaks, and eases relative to the dose, meals, and stress.\n- Singing: keep warmups light for a few days and prioritize relaxed, low-volume phrasing with long, easy exhales. If the sensation interferes, take a break rather than pushing.\n\nContact your prescriber soon if\n- The air hunger persists more than a couple of days, is clearly dose-related, or interferes with daily life/singing.\n- You notice resting HR persistently >100–110, significant blood pressure elevation, severe nausea, agitation, or insomnia.\nYour psychiatrist might lower the dose, switch timing, or consider alternatives (e.g., methylphenidate at a lower target, or non-stimulants like atomoxetine or guanfacine), especially given your sensitivity on Concerta.\n\nGo to urgent care/ER now if any red flags appear:\n- Wheezing, noisy breathing, or swelling of lips/tongue/throat; rash/hives\n- Chest pain/pressure, fainting, severe dizziness, or palpitations with HR >130 at rest\n- Blue lips/fingertips, oxygen saturation <92% if you can check it\n- Fever, productive cough, or sudden, worsening shortness of breath\n\nIf you reply with your current Vyvanse dose, timing relative to meals, resting HR/BP (if available), and whether you have any chest pain, wheeze, swelling, or rash, I can tailor the next steps more precisely.",

    "question": "Hi. I just wanna have some guidance in advance if someone can help me :(This hadn't happened to me since March 2020. It happened again last week and sometimes I do feel a bit drowsy or weird but haven't had a full on focal seizure again.What I experienced was:Nausea I saw an aura, or like static? on my right eye that then turned into colors.   My limbs went cold I had a deja vu sensation, like I started to think things I hadn't thought of in two years? I don't know how to explain it I lost all peripheral vision on my right eye for a good while.Speaking was difficult Almost lost consciousness (in 2020 I did lose consciousness and moved my eyes from side to side very rapidly and my face went droopy last time). Back then I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything. Since it never happened again I didn't go see a neurologist but the other day it happened twice so I immediately booked an appointment.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry this is happening again. From what you describe—sudden visual “static/colors,” right-sided vision loss, déjà vu, nausea, feeling cold, trouble speaking, near-blackout, and then drowsiness—this could be a focal seizure (often temporal/occipital lobe). Migraine aura can look similar, and much less commonly transient ischemia (TIA), retinal/optic nerve issues, or other causes can mimic this. Because you had two events in one day and past loss of consciousness, your plan to see a neurologist is absolutely right.\n\nWhat to do now (before your appointment)\n- Safety first:\n  - Don’t drive or operate machinery until a clinician clears you. Most places require a seizure‑free period.\n  - Avoid swimming alone, bathing in a tub (take showers), climbing heights, or using open flames.\n  - Let someone close to you know what to do if you have another episode.\n- Track episodes:\n  - Keep a diary: date/time, what you felt first, how long, any triggers (stress, sleep loss, alcohol, illness, flashing lights), period timing if applicable, and how you felt after.\n  - If safe, have someone video an event—very helpful for diagnosis.\n  - Next time test whether the vision change is in one eye or the right side of both eyes by covering each eye briefly.\n- Reduce common triggers:\n  - Prioritize sleep, regular meals, hydration, limit alcohol, avoid recreational drugs, manage stress, avoid missed doses of any regular meds.\n- Medications/substances that can lower seizure threshold:\n  - Examples: bupropion, tramadol, some antibiotics (e.g., high-dose fluoroquinolones), stimulants, excess alcohol or withdrawal. If you use any of these, let your doctor know; don’t stop prescriptions without medical advice.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now\n- Call emergency services if:\n  - A seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, or you have repeated events without full recovery.\n  - You injure yourself, are pregnant, have diabetes, or the episode occurs in water.\n  - You have new persistent one‑sided weakness/numbness, severe “worst-ever” headache, confusion, persistent speech trouble, or vision loss that doesn’t resolve within an hour—these can be stroke/TIA or retinal emergencies.\n  - New monocular (one-eye) vision loss can be an eye/vascular emergency even outside an event.\n\nWhat to expect at the neurology visit\n- History and exam, plus likely:\n  - EEG (possibly sleep-deprived or ambulatory) to look for epileptiform activity.\n  - Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol.\n  - Labs: metabolic panel (glucose, sodium, calcium, magnesium), CBC; pregnancy test if applicable; others based on history.\n- If seizures are suspected, discussion of starting an antiseizure medicine (common first‑line for focal seizures: levetiracetam or lamotrigine) and a rescue medication (e.g., intranasal midazolam) for prolonged events.\n- If migraine is suspected, migraine-specific treatment and prevention strategies.\n- If vision loss sounded monocular, you may also be referred to ophthalmology.\n\nDriving and legal considerations\n- Most regions require a seizure‑free interval (often 3–12 months) before driving; your neurologist can advise based on your location.\n\nHelpful prep for the appointment\n- Bring a list of all meds/supplements, prior test results (from 2020 if you have them), family history of seizures/migraine, any head injuries, and a clear timeline of events.\n- Note your menstruation timing if relevant; hormones can affect seizures (catamenial pattern).\n- Write down questions you want answered (diagnosis likelihood, tests, meds’ side effects and interactions—e.g., with contraception—safety rules, driving).\n\nIf you’re comfortable, share:\n- Your age, any history of migraines, head injury, infections/fevers, sleep deprivation, alcohol/drug use, current meds (including birth control, ADHD meds, antidepressants), and whether any symptoms are still present now. That can help me tailor advice while you wait for your visit.\n\nYou did the right thing by booking neurology promptly. In the meantime, prioritize safety, keep a careful log, and avoid driving. If anything becomes persistent or severe as above, go to urgent care/ER.",

    "question": "I’m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I’m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
    "answer": "Thank you for laying this out so clearly. What you describe is complex but there are some recognizable patterns. The combination of Alice in Wonderland–type visual distortions, transient trouble understanding speech, depersonalization, tremor, panic/autonomic symptoms, and occasional ptosis, often triggered by certain foods and sleep, fits best with a neurologic syndrome in the migraine–epilepsy–autonomic spectrum. The rapid relief after a bowel movement suggests a strong gut–brain/autonomic component as well.\n\nMost likely possibilities to consider\n- Migraine spectrum (aura ± headache): AIWS, transient dysphasia, sensory overload, and blurry vision are well-described auras; food and sleep changes are common triggers. Some people have “migraine aura without headache.” Ptosis can rarely occur with migraine.  \n- Focal seizures (often temporal lobe; sometimes nocturnal): depersonalization, fear/panic, impaired comprehension, autonomic symptoms, and postictal confusion can look like your episodes. Childhood nocturnal vomiting with AIWS strengthens this consideration.  \n- Functional neurological symptoms/PNES layered on top of the above: anxiety and sensory intolerance can amplify episodes, but PNES should only be concluded after seizures are ruled out (ideally by video-EEG).  \n- Autonomic dysfunction/dysautonomia (sometimes overlapping with IBS): strong gut triggers, relief after stool, “restricted circulation,” and panic with mouth/face numbness (can be from hyperventilation) point to a gut–autonomic link.  \n- Less common but important to exclude: neuro-ophthalmic causes of intermittent unilateral ptosis (myasthenia gravis, Horner syndrome, cranial nerve III palsy).\n\nWhat to do next\n1) See a neurologist (priority)\n- Ask for: brain MRI with and without contrast; EEG (consider sleep-deprived and/or ambulatory or inpatient video-EEG if events are frequent); formal migraine evaluation.  \n- Bring a symptom diary (see below). Video of an event (with consent) is very helpful.\n\n2) See a neuro-ophthalmologist or ophthalmologist\n- Evaluate intermittent ptosis and blurry vision; check for anisocoria and fatigable ptosis (myasthenia testing if indicated).\n\n3) Primary care +/- gastroenterology\n- Screen for common contributors and food-related conditions: CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate, ferritin, vitamin D, HbA1c.  \n- Celiac screen (tTG-IgA with total IgA). Consider lactose intolerance or FODMAP sensitivity; SIBO testing only if clinically suggested.  \n- Consider orthostatic vitals to screen for POTS/dysautonomia.\n\n4) Mental health support\n- Whether or not PNES is present, anxiety management can reduce episode severity: CBT, exposure-based therapy for sensory intolerance, and skills for panic.\n\nSymptom and trigger diary (start now)\n- For each episode note: date/time; foods and drinks in prior 24–48 hours; sleep duration/quality; stress; exercise; prodrome (AIWS, sensory changes, nausea); exact symptoms and sequence; duration; bowel movements and whether symptoms improved after; medications taken.  \n- If possible, record pulse and blood pressure lying and standing when symptomatic.\n\nAt-home strategies that are usually safe\n- Migraine hygiene: regular sleep/wake time; consistent meals; hydration; limit caffeine swings; avoid known triggers (aged/fermented foods high in histamine/tyramine, MSG, nitrates, alcohol).  \n- Consider a time-limited, nonrestrictive trial with a dietitian: start by removing your top 1–2 suspected triggers; avoid broad, prolonged restriction given your BMI.  \n- Acute migraine supports: dark quiet room; early NSAID if you use them; magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg in the evening can help some (reduce if it loosens stools).  \n- Prevention supplements with some evidence: riboflavin (B2) 400 mg/day; CoQ10 100–300 mg/day. Discuss with your clinician first.  \n- Panic/hyperventilation control: slow nasal breathing (for example 4-second inhale, 6–8-second exhale) for 5–10 minutes; grounding techniques; avoid overbreathing. Perioral/mouth numbness often improves within minutes with slow breathing.  \n- Gentle, regular exercise; sunlight exposure; stress reduction.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or markedly worse neurologic deficit (weakness, persistent one-sided numbness, facial droop, severe new double vision, continuous trouble speaking/understanding) lasting more than 1 hour.  \n- “Worst headache of life,” head injury, fainting, persistent vomiting, severe chest pain, or a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or clusters without recovery.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Your history includes red-flag features (transient aphasia, intermittent ptosis, nocturnal events) that merit proper neurologic workup, even though this has been ongoing for years. The good news is that migraine variants, autonomic dysfunction, and even many focal epilepsies are treatable, and targeted therapy can substantially reduce episodes.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you structure a one-page summary to take to your neurologist and a template for the symptom/food diary.",

    "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
    "answer": "Short answer: the “foggy/drunk” feeling can happen with levetiracetam (Keppra), is usually dose-related, and can often be improved by adjusting the formulation, dose, or timing—but don’t make changes without speaking with your prescriber.\n\nKey points for you:\n- Common side effects: brain fog, dizziness, sleepiness, coordination issues, and mood changes (irritability, anxiety/depression). These are more likely at higher doses or soon after a dose.\n- Dosing matters:\n  - Immediate‑release (IR) Keppra is designed to be taken twice daily.\n  - Extended‑release (XR) Keppra is designed for once‑daily dosing.\n  - If you’re taking IR once daily, you may get a higher peak (more “foggy”) followed by a low trough (possible breakthrough seizures). Confirm with your pharmacy/doctor whether you’re on XR or IR.\n- With food: You can take it with or without food; food won’t change overall absorption much but can reduce stomach upset. It usually won’t fix fogginess.\n- Time of day: \n  - If sedation is the main issue, taking XR at bedtime can help.\n  - If you’re on IR, splitting the dose about 12 hours apart is standard. Some people feel better with a slightly larger portion at night, but do this only with your clinician’s guidance.\n- Dose: Many adults do well between 500–1500 mg twice daily (IR) or 1000–3000 mg once daily (XR). If side effects are troublesome, a slower titration, a lower total dose (if seizure control allows), or switching to XR can help.\n- Alternatives: If levetiracetam side effects persist, options like brivaracetam (similar, often fewer behavioral effects), lamotrigine, or lacosamide may be considered by your neurologist.\n\nSafety and practical tips:\n- Don’t stop Keppra suddenly; that can trigger seizures.\n- If you feel “drunk/foggy,” avoid driving or operating machinery.\n- Limit/avoid alcohol; it can worsen fogginess and seizure risk.\n- Sleep, hydration, and regular dosing times help.\n- Ibuprofen (Motrin) doesn’t meaningfully interact with Keppra, but high doses of NSAIDs can affect kidneys. Because Keppra is cleared by the kidneys, make sure your kidney function has been checked recently; dose is adjusted if kidney function is reduced.\n- Seek urgent help if you notice severe mood changes, depression, suicidal thoughts, severe confusion, falls, new rash, or worsening seizures.\n\nWhat I recommend you do next:\n1) Call your neurologist or pharmacist to confirm whether your current prescription is IR or XR. If it’s IR once daily, ask about:\n   - Switching to XR once daily (often at bedtime), or\n   - Returning to split IR dosing with possible dose adjustment/titration.\n2) Keep a brief symptom diary for a week: when you take the dose, when fogginess starts, and how long it lasts. Bring this to your visit.\n3) Ask about checking kidney function if not done recently.\n4) If mood irritability is an issue, ask your clinician about a short trial of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine); some people find it helps with levetiracetam‑related irritability. Don’t exceed recommended doses.\n\nA few quick questions to tailor advice:\n- Are you on Keppra IR or Keppra XR right now?\n- What exact time(s) are you taking it?\n- Have you been seizure‑free since the change to once daily?\n- Any mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression) or sleep issues?\n- Any kidney problems in the past?\n\nIf you share those details, I can give more specific guidance to discuss with your doctor.",

    "question": "Age - 30   Sex - male    Height - 5'8\"-174 cm    Weight - 60 kgs.    Duration of complaint - 3 years    Location - Soft palate    Any existing relevant medical issues - Subjective Tinnitus caused by olanzapine and an MRI scan   Current medications - Cinolazepam for sleep, Mysoline for the myoclonus. Is palatal myoclonus treatable?",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes—palatal myoclonus (now often called palatal tremor) is usually manageable, though “cure” is less common. The best treatment depends on the type and cause.\n\nKey points\n- Two main types:\n  - Essential palatal tremor (EPT): no brain lesion; often causes rhythmic ear “clicking” from Eustachian tube opening. Tends to respond well to botulinum toxin.\n  - Symptomatic palatal tremor (SPT): due to a lesion in the brainstem/cerebellum circuit (the Guillain–Mollaret triangle); MRI may show hypertrophic olivary degeneration. Often more persistent; treat the underlying cause when possible and manage symptoms.\n\nHow it’s treated\n- Botulinum toxin injections: The most effective option for many, especially EPT with ear clicking. Small doses are injected into the overactive palatal muscle (tensor or levator veli palatini) under endoscopic/EMG guidance. Benefit typically lasts 2–4 months; injections are repeated as needed. Possible temporary side effects: nasal-sounding speech, mild swallowing difficulty, nasal regurgitation, ear fullness—usually dose-dependent and reversible.\n- Medications: Evidence is mixed. Options sometimes tried include clonazepam, levetiracetam, valproate, carbamazepine, gabapentin, piracetam, baclofen. Primidone (Mysoline) is less commonly effective for palatal tremor. Because you’re on cinolazepam (a benzodiazepine), adding clonazepam would require careful substitution/avoidance of dual benzodiazepines. Discuss with your neurologist.\n- Treat the cause (SPT): If due to an active process (e.g., inflammation, demyelination, tumor), targeted therapy may help. If the lesion is old and stable, symptom control (often botulinum toxin) is the mainstay.\n- Behavioral/supportive: Stress reduction, good sleep, limit stimulants; voice/ENT therapy may help some.\n\nWork-up/next steps\n- Clarify type: If your prior brain MRI was normal and you have rhythmic ear clicking, EPT is more likely. If MRI showed brainstem/cerebellar changes, or you have oscillopsia/ataxia, SPT is more likely.\n- ENT (laryngology) evaluation with flexible nasopharyngoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and identify which palatal muscle is involved—this guides botulinum injection.\n- Movement-disorders neurology consultation to optimize medication strategy and coordinate care.\n- Audiology if tinnitus is prominent. If the tinnitus is rhythmic and synchronous with palatal movement, treating the tremor often reduces it.\n\nSafety notes for your current meds\n- Primidone plus a benzodiazepine (cinolazepam) can increase sedation, imbalance, and cognitive side effects. Avoid alcohol and don’t combine with other sedatives. If medication changes are considered (e.g., trying clonazepam or levetiracetam), do this under your prescriber’s guidance.\n\nIf you can share:\n- Whether you have rhythmic ear clicking\n- What your MRI report showed\n- Whether the movements persist during sleep\nThese details help predict which treatment is most likely to work. In many cases—especially EPT—botulinum toxin gives meaningful, repeatable relief.",

    "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I’m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn’t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn’t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I’ll say “and” a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don’t know if they’re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don’t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don’t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I’m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I’m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I’m 5’4, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",
    "answer": "Thanks for laying all of that out. I can’t diagnose or read your scan definitively here, but I can tell you what to look for on your MRI/MRV and how it ties to your symptoms, plus what’s worth prioritizing with your neurologist/hematologist and eye doctor.\n\nIf you can share images\nPlease include these specific sequences/slices if possible:\n- MRV (venography): MIP reconstructions and source images of the superior sagittal, transverse/sigmoid sinuses, and internal jugulars.\n- Axial T1 post-contrast and axial/coronal T2/FLAIR through the venous sinuses and both temporal lobes (especially hippocampi).\n- SWI (susceptibility) through the venous sinuses and temporal lobes (for old clot or microbleeds).\n- DWI/ADC (for any restricted diffusion).\n- Sagittal T1 midline (pituitary/sella) and axial/coronal T2 through the orbits (if available).\n\nWhat we’d be looking for\n- CVST status: Recanalization vs residual clot/stenosis of the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses and the right IJ; collateral venous channels.\n- Right temporal lobe: Old venous infarct, gliosis/scar, hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia—anything that could explain focal seizures.\n- Signs suggesting raised intracranial pressure/IIH: Partially empty sella, distended optic nerve sheaths, flattened posterior globes, transverse sinus stenosis. Your weight gain and visual field issues make this worth checking.\n- Microhemorrhages or siderosis on SWI.\n\nHow this connects to your symptoms\n- Focal impaired awareness seizures (déjà vu, zoning out, speech arrest/stuttering, jaw clenching): These fit right temporal lobe onset. Seizures can develop months–years after a CVST if there’s residual scar.\n- Vision: “Right eye peripheral vision loss” could be optic nerve (monocular) or brain (homonymous). Papilledema from high ICP typically causes enlarged blind spots, transient dimming, and can eventually cause field loss. Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation with OCT (optic nerve), fundus exam for papilledema/optic atrophy, and formal visual fields is important.\n- Temperature attacks, sweating, shaking, passing out on getting up: Could be autonomic seizures, dysautonomia (e.g., POTS), medication effects, thyroid issues, or sleep-related problems. Temporal lobe seizures can have autonomic features. Orthostatic vitals/tilt table + basic labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, AM cortisol, B12/iron) are reasonable. Consider ambulatory EEG to catch nocturnal events.\n- Sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, “exploding head syndrome”: Benign but worsened by sleep deprivation, anxiety, and some meds. Obstructive sleep apnea is common with weight gain and can worsen seizures and parasomnias—consider a sleep study if snoring/daytime sleepiness.\n\nMedications and safety notes\n- Apixaban (Eliquis): Generally compatible with levetiracetam (Keppra). Avoid NSAIDs, high-dose fish oil, and enzyme-inducing antiseizure meds (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarb, primidone) which can lower apixaban levels. Avoid St. John’s wort. Be cautious with heavy grapefruit intake.\n- With heterozygous Factor V Leiden and history of DVT + CVST, many hematologists recommend indefinite anticoagulation; confirm with yours. Avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives/hormones.\n- Keppra: If irritability/mood issues occur, ask about pyridoxine (B6) 25–50 mg daily; discuss before starting. If seizures persist, a second agent like lamotrigine or lacosamide is often considered.\n- Driving: Given episodes while driving, follow local laws—usually no driving until seizure-free for the required period.\n- Seizure safety: Don’t swim alone, take showers not baths, use caution with ladders/heights, consider a rescue med (e.g., intranasal midazolam) if you have clusters.\n\nWhat to ask your doctors\nNeurology/epilepsy\n- Do my images show mesial temporal sclerosis, right temporal gliosis, or old venous infarct?\n- Is there persistent venous outflow stenosis that could be keeping my ICP high?\n- Should I get an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) evaluation or ambulatory EEG to confirm onset and optimize meds?\n- Screen for sleep apnea and dysautonomia given nocturnal events and temperature spells?\n- Rescue plan for seizures; driving clearance timeline.\n\nNeuro-ophthalmology\n- Is there papilledema or optic neuropathy? OCT and formal visual fields.\n- If suspicion for raised ICP remains, is a lumbar puncture (opening pressure) indicated after imaging excludes active thrombosis?\n\nHematology\n- Duration of anticoagulation (likely long-term), monitoring plan, and med interactions to avoid.\n- Contraception options safe with FVL and anticoagulation.\n\nPractical sleep steps now\n- Strict sleep schedule, side-sleeping, minimize alcohol/caffeine late day, morning light, screens off 1–2 hours before bed.\n- If on propranolol at night and getting vivid dreams/terrors, ask about moving dose earlier.\n- Consider CBT-I; melatonin 0.5–1 mg 4–6 hours before bedtime can help with circadian timing (ask your doc).\n\nRed flags that need urgent care\n- Sudden severe “worst headache,” new or rapidly worsening vision loss, a new focal neurologic deficit, or increasing seizure frequency/clusters.\n- Signs of bleeding on apixaban (black stools, severe bruising, vomiting blood), or a significant head injury.\n\nIf you can upload: MRV MIPs, axial T1 post-contrast of the sinuses, coronal T2 through the hippocampi, axial FLAIR at the temporal lobes, SWI at the venous sinuses and temporal lobes, and the midline sagittal T1. If you only can share a few, prioritize MRV MIP, coronal T2 through hippocampi, and axial T1 post-contrast at the level of the transverse/sigmoid sinuses.\n\nA few clarifying questions that would help:\n- How often are seizures now on Keppra, and any missed doses?\n- Any current headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, or transient visual dimming?\n- Do you snore or feel excessively sleepy in the daytime?\n- Do the heat/cold episodes correlate with seizures or position changes?\n- Are you on any hormonal medications?\n\nIf you can share the images noted above, I can point out general features to discuss with your doctors.",

    "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational. CT scans August 16th - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 1005.29 September 22nd - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 799 September 23rd - Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis Total Exam DLP: 652 September 25th - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 763 November 15th - Chest/abdomen/pelvis W contrast Total Exam DLP: 1291.11 CONTRAST: 80 mL of Iohexol Inj 80 mL November 18th - Full body PET scan Total Exam DLP: A fuck load December 15th - Head scan Total Exam DLP: 881.17",
    "answer": "First, I’m really sorry you went through all of that. It’s completely understandable to worry afterward about the scans and “what it all means.” The short version: based on the numbers you shared, your cumulative radiation dose is in a range that is unlikely to cause harm, and the added lifetime cancer risk is small. Nothing in your list approaches the kinds of doses where we see deterministic harm (like skin injury or cataracts), and it’s orders of magnitude lower than radiation therapy.\n\nHere’s a practical estimate using standard conversion factors from DLP to effective dose (these are approximations; real values vary by scanner and protocol ±30%):\n\nYour CTs\n- Head CTs (4 scans; DLPs 1005, 799, 763, 881 mGy·cm)\n  • Head conversion factor ≈ 0.0021 mSv per mGy·cm\n  • Effective dose ≈ 2.1 + 1.7 + 1.6 + 1.9 ≈ 7.3 mSv total\n\n- Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT (DLP 652 mGy·cm)\n  • CAP conversion factor ≈ 0.015 mSv per mGy·cm\n  • Effective dose ≈ 9.8 mSv\n\n- Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT with contrast (DLP 1291 mGy·cm)\n  • Effective dose ≈ 19.4 mSv\n  • Note: Iohexol contrast is not radioactive; it doesn’t add radiation.\n\n- PET/CT (you wrote “a lot”)\n  • Typical whole-body FDG PET/CT: about 15–25 mSv total (≈7 mSv from the tracer + 8–15 mSv from the CT, depending on whether the CT was low-dose or fully diagnostic). A reasonable midpoint estimate is ≈20 mSv.\n\nPutting it together\n- Head CTs ≈ 7 mSv\n- CT CAPs ≈ 10 mSv + 19 mSv = 29 mSv\n- PET/CT ≈ 20 mSv\n- Total ≈ 56 mSv, with a plausible range roughly 40–75 mSv.\n\nWhat that means for risk\n- Background radiation is about 3 mSv per year in the US (varies by location). Your total is roughly the same as 15–20 years of background.\n- Occupational comparison: The annual legal limit for radiation workers is 50 mSv in the US (ICRP recommends 20 mSv/year averaged over 5 years). Your cumulative total is on the order of one “limit year,” but radiation workers can receive such doses repeatedly over years; your exposure was a one-off for medical necessity.\n- Airline crew accumulate ~2–5 mSv/year, so your total is about 10–25 “pilot years.”\n- Radiotherapy delivers tens of thousands of mSv to treated areas (50,000+ mSv). You are orders of magnitude below that.\n- Nuclear accident/atomic bomb survivors often received hundreds to thousands of mSv acutely. You are far below those levels.\n\nEstimated added lifetime cancer risk\n- A commonly used population risk coefficient is about 5–6% per Sv (ICRP). At ~0.056 Sv, that’s roughly 0.3% absolute increase in lifetime cancer risk. Depending on age/sex and the true dose, a fair range is ~0.2–0.5%.\n- For context, baseline lifetime cancer risk is about 40%. So your exposure might move that to ~40.3%—a small change that is not measurable at the individual level.\n- Heritable/genetic risk in future children at these doses is effectively negligible (ICRP puts this at ~0.2% per Sv; your dose would add ~0.01%).\n\nOther reassurances\n- MRI and lumbar punctures involve no ionizing radiation.\n- Deterministic effects (like skin injury or cataracts) occur at much higher localized doses than those from a handful of CTs. They are not expected from what you had.\n- Most of your dose came from the two CAP CTs and the PET/CT; head CTs contribute relatively little effective dose.\n\nWhat you can do going forward\n- Keep a record of prior imaging and share it so future teams can avoid repeats if not clinically needed.\n- When imaging is needed, ask if MRI or ultrasound could answer the question (often they can, especially for follow-up).\n- If CT is needed, ask for dose-sparing protocols tailored to your size and the clinical indication.\n- Focus on risk reducers that have a much bigger impact than this radiation dose: no smoking, healthy weight, exercise, moderate/no alcohol, test and mitigate radon at home if needed, up-to-date vaccinations and routine cancer screening.\n\nBottom line\nBased on your list, your cumulative dose is in a range where any increase in lifetime cancer risk is small (on the order of a few tenths of a percent) and not something that should keep you from moving forward. Many people receive similar or higher doses during complex medical workups and do well. Given what you were going through medically, the imaging was a reasonable part of ruling out dangerous conditions. If it would help your peace of mind, you can ask your hospital’s medical physicist or radiation safety officer to review your exact scan parameters and give you a personalized dose summary—but from what you’ve shared, your concerns about a large cancer risk aren’t supported by the data.\n\nIf anxiety about this keeps spiking, that’s also understandable after a traumatic health year—talking with your clinician about it (and, if helpful, a brief round of CBT or mindfulness-based strategies) can make a big difference.",

    "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
    "answer": "Short answer: the vagus nerve is real and important, and targeted stimulation can help in a few specific, evidence‑based situations. But it’s not a cure‑all, and a lot of online claims are oversold.\n\nWhat it is\n- The vagus nerves (one on each side) are the main highways of the parasympathetic nervous system. About 80% of their fibers carry information from body to brain; the rest go from brain to organs.\n- They help:\n  - Slow the heart rate and influence blood pressure via the baroreflex\n  - Coordinate digestion (swallowing, stomach emptying, intestinal motility)\n  - Modulate immune/inflammatory signaling (“cholinergic anti‑inflammatory pathway”)\n  - Affect voice, cough, and parts of the ear\n\nWhere stimulation is clearly useful\n- Medically implanted vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices:\n  - Drug‑resistant epilepsy: reduces seizure frequency on average by ~25–50% over time. Approved for this.\n  - Treatment‑resistant depression: approved as an adjunct in people who haven’t responded to multiple treatments; benefits are modest and gradual.\n- Noninvasive devices:\n  - Transcutaneous cervical stimulation (gammaCore): authorized for acute migraine and cluster headache treatment. Benefits are modest for some people.\n  - Transcutaneous auricular stimulation (ear clip/electrode at the tragus/cymba): promising research, but approvals and benefits vary; not a universal fix.\n\nClaims with some truth but often overstated\n- Anxiety/stress: Slow breathing and certain relaxation practices increase parasympathetic activity and can lower momentary stress and heart rate. taVNS shows small short‑term benefits in studies, but it’s not a substitute for first‑line treatments (therapy, SSRIs like sertraline, exercise, sleep).\n- Blood pressure: Vagal maneuvers can transiently lower heart rate and sometimes blood pressure. Slow, regular breathing may lower average BP a few mmHg over time. There’s no strong evidence that casual “vagus nerve hacks” produce large or lasting BP changes on their own.\n- Digestion: The vagus supports gut motility. However, for chronic GI problems (IBS, gastroparesis), evidence that at‑home “vagus stimulation” fixes symptoms is limited. Some device‑based approaches are being studied, but they’re not standard care.\n\nWhat’s more hype than help\n- The idea that you can “reset” or “detox” your nervous system or cure diverse conditions just by “stimulating your vagus nerve.”\n- Using heart‑rate variability (HRV) gadgets as a definitive measure of “vagal tone” or health. HRV reflects multiple factors and is not a simple vagus score.\n\nSimple things that safely engage the parasympathetic system\nThese aren’t “stimulation” in the medical sense, but they nudge the same pathways and are low‑risk:\n- Slow diaphragmatic breathing: about 5–6 breaths per minute (for example, inhale 4–5 seconds, exhale 5–6 seconds) for 5–10 minutes, 1–2 times daily or during stress.\n- Regular aerobic exercise and good sleep.\n- Mindfulness, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation.\n- Singing/humming/gentle gargling: small effects, but harmless for most people.\n- Brief cool water on the face can trigger a “diving reflex” that slows heart rate; avoid if you have heart rhythm issues or a tendency to faint.\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don’t perform carotid sinus massage on yourself.\n- Be cautious with extreme cold exposure, prolonged breath‑holding, or intense “hacks” if you have heart disease, low blood pressure, fainting spells, or are pregnant.\n- Be skeptical of pricey consumer gadgets promising broad health fixes.\n\nSide effects and safety\n- Implanted and noninvasive VNS can cause hoarseness, throat tingling, cough, neck discomfort, or ear irritation; rarely, bradycardia (slow heart rate) or fainting if stimulation is too strong.\n- Device cautions: pacemakers/defibrillators, significant heart rhythm disorders, and certain ear conditions may be contraindications—discuss with a clinician.\n- Sertraline doesn’t have a specific interaction with VNS; many patients with depression who get VNS remain on SSRIs.\n\nBottom line\n- Not bullshit—there are legitimate, evidence‑based uses—but it’s not magic. Medical‑grade VNS helps specific conditions (epilepsy, some depression, some headaches). For general wellness, stress, and possibly mild BP benefits, simple breathing and relaxation practices are the most supported, lowest‑risk options.\n- If you’re considering a device for anxiety or migraines, or you have significant GI or blood pressure issues, talk with your clinician about what’s evidence‑based and appropriate in Canada.",

    "question": "i was diagnosed when i was young with a seizure thing that goes away when youre 13, which impairs my ability to concentrate and gave me seizures while im sleeping about once every blood moon and my mom told me it was epilepsy, but see the thing is that shes not very good with english, and i have never had any trouble with seeing flashing lights. is it possible to have epilepsy but no trouble with seeing flashing colors?",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes. Most people with epilepsy are not sensitive to flashing lights. Only about 3% have “photosensitive epilepsy,” where strobe/flashing patterns can trigger seizures.\n\nWhat you describe—rare seizures during sleep, starting in childhood, said to “go away by around 13,” and some attention/concentration issues—fits well with a common pediatric pattern such as:\n- Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (formerly “benign rolandic epilepsy”): often causes nighttime seizures, speech arrest, facial twitching/drooling; usually remits by early teens.\n- Self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (Panayiotopoulos syndrome): often nocturnal, with vomiting or other autonomic symptoms; also tends to remit in childhood.\n\nNeither of these depends on flashing lights as a trigger. Common triggers instead include sleep deprivation, illness/fever, stress, and alcohol. Attention issues can occur in some kids with these syndromes due to the epilepsy itself, sleep disruption, or medications.\n\nIf you’re still having occasional nocturnal seizures now, it’s worth checking in with a neurologist to confirm what type you have and whether you still need treatment or precautions.\n\nHelpful next steps:\n- Ask for your old records/EEG report to learn the specific diagnosis name.\n- Consider an updated evaluation (neurology visit, EEG—sometimes sleep-deprived—and a medication review if you’re on any).\n- Safety: prioritize good sleep, limit alcohol/recreational drugs, manage stress; don’t stop seizure meds suddenly; use caution with swimming/heights and follow local driving rules if applicable.\n- Seek urgent care if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, you have repeated seizures without full recovery, or there’s injury or trouble breathing.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- Your current age\n- When your last seizure was\n- Whether you take any seizure medicine\n- Any patterns you’ve noticed (only during sleep, illness-related, etc.)\nI can tailor guidance based on that.",

    "question": "Does radiation necrosis heal? 31 female 155 lbs Diagnosed w/ Brain AVM & 2 aneurysms 2009. - 3 gamma knife treatments in 2019. edications: Topamax, Trileptal, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Clonidine, Vyvanse, Vitamin D, Folic Acid & had Kyleena IUD replaced February 16th. - important because vision symptoms started could be coincidence. Shortly after I had my new iud put in I started having issues with my left eye, vision became blurry”ish” on and off. For the next 3 weeks I Had slow thought processing during the time & some confusion. - Hard time finding words. I also had some “left neglect” symptoms but that’s normal for me when I get migraines because my left side goes numb so I related all of this to stress & the migraines until I started having muscle twitching in my left hand & wrist. - I started to improve end of March but My vision is still off sometimes & I’m not as sharp as I used to be. I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me?

I don’t see a dr until June and google is not my friend.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—waiting for answers is really stressful. I’ll explain the terms and the usual patterns after Gamma Knife, and what questions to ask. If you can paste the “Impression” (and “Comparison”) section of your MRI report, I can translate it line by line.\n\nBig picture about radiation necrosis (RN) after Gamma Knife\n- What it is: A delayed injury to brain tissue and small blood vessels from radiation. It can cause local tissue death (necrosis) and surrounding swelling (edema).\n- When it happens: Can appear months to several years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Multiple treatments and higher total dose increase risk. So your timeline (treatments in 2019, symptoms in 2023) is plausible.\n- Symptoms: Headache, confusion/brain fog, word-finding trouble, visual field issues, focal weakness/numbness, seizures or twitching. These can flare and then improve.\n- Is it dangerous? It can be, if swelling or mass effect is significant, or if it triggers seizures. Most cases are manageable with treatment and monitoring.\n\nDoes radiation necrosis “heal”?\n- The permanently injured core (necrotic tissue) typically does not “regrow,” but the surrounding swelling and inflammation often improve—sometimes dramatically—with time and treatment.\n- RN can wax and wane over months. Many people experience stabilization or improvement; some need active treatment to get there.\n\nIs this the same as an ischemic stroke?\n- No. Ischemic stroke is sudden loss of blood flow from a blocked artery. RN is delayed radiation injury that damages tissue and tiny vessels over time. Both can cause similar neurologic symptoms, but the mechanisms and treatments differ.\n\nWhat is FLAIR hyperintensity?\n- FLAIR is an MRI sequence that highlights water. “Hyperintensity on FLAIR” usually means extra water in tissue—edema, inflammation, or scarring (gliosis). It does not automatically mean permanent damage; it often reflects swelling around a lesion.\n\nCould this be swelling rather than necrosis?\n- Often both are present. Symptoms often correlate more with edema than with the necrotic core. If symptoms improve with steroids, that suggests swelling is a major component.\n- MRI features help distinguish: RN typically shows contrast enhancement with surrounding FLAIR edema, often with low perfusion on perfusion MRI and a lipid-lactate peak on MR spectroscopy. Your report may mention these.\n\nDid it progress fast between 2022 and 2023?\n- Hard to say without the actual report and prior measurements. Look for wording like “increased/decreased size of enhancement/edema,” “stable,” “new,” “mass effect,” or measurements in mm. Paste those lines and I’ll interpret.\n\nAbout your symptoms and tests\n- Left-hand/wrist twitching could be focal seizures. You’re already on antiseizure meds (topiramate and oxcarbazepine), but seizures can still happen; dosing or levels sometimes need adjustment.\n- EEG “slowing” is common in areas of prior injury, edema, or post-radiation change. It’s nonspecific and not by itself dangerous, but it fits with brain tissue under stress.\n- Cognitive slowing and word-finding trouble can be from edema/RN, migraines, poor sleep, stress, and also from medications (topiramate, oxcarbazepine, clonidine can all slow cognition). Vyvanse may offset some of this; Wellbutrin can lower seizure threshold. Don’t change anything on your own, but it’s worth reviewing the overall medication mix with your neurologist.\n- Visual symptoms: RN or edema near the visual pathways can cause blurry vision or a missing wedge/side of the visual field. A neuro-ophthalmology exam can help localize.\n\nTypical treatments for symptomatic radiation necrosis\n- Steroids (e.g., dexamethasone) to reduce edema—short course with careful taper. This often improves symptoms quickly; side effects need monitoring.\n- Bevacizumab (Avastin) can shrink edema and reduce enhancement in many patients within weeks; usually given as a few infusions. Risks: high blood pressure, bleeding, clots, wound-healing issues—discuss given your AVM history.\n- Pentoxifylline plus vitamin E: low-risk option some centers use; benefit is variable but side effects are generally mild.\n- Hyperbaric oxygen: mixed evidence; sometimes tried.\n- For refractory cases with a focal lesion and mass effect: surgical options (resection or laser interstitial thermal therapy) can help.\n- Seizure management: adjust antiseizure meds if twitching or spells persist.\n- Rehabilitation: speech therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, and vision therapy can meaningfully improve function.\n\nImaging and tests that help clarify RN vs other causes\n- Contrast-enhanced MRI with:\n  - Perfusion (rCBV): RN tends to have low perfusion; active lesion/tumor has higher perfusion.\n  - MR spectroscopy: RN often shows lipid-lactate peak with low choline.\n  - Diffusion (DWI/ADC): RN typically does not show true restricted diffusion; acute ischemic stroke does.\n- For AVMs: catheter angiography (DSA) is the gold standard to confirm AVM obliteration after Gamma Knife. Ask whether your AVM is fully obliterated.\n\nWhat to ask your doctor (or include if you paste your report)\n- Exact location and size of the lesion(s).\n- Is there contrast enhancement? Ring-like? Any “mass effect” or midline shift?\n- FLAIR edema extent: increasing, stable, or improving?\n- Perfusion results (rCBV) or MR spectroscopy findings, if done.\n- Any signs of hemorrhage.\n- Comparison to prior MRI: is it stable/progressing?\n- Whether your AVM is completely obliterated on angiography.\n- Whether a short steroid trial or bevacizumab is appropriate now.\n- Whether your current antiseizure regimen or medication mix needs adjustment.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or rapidly worsening weakness, numbness, vision loss, severe headache with vomiting, confusion, or any seizure lasting >5 minutes or back-to-back seizures without recovery. If that happens, go to the emergency department.\n\nOn the IUD/recent change\n- Hormonal shifts can influence migraines and how you feel, but they don’t cause radiation necrosis. They could exacerbate migraine-related symptoms that overlap with RN symptoms.\n\nIf you can, please paste the “Impression” (and “Comparison”) from your MRI report and any comments about enhancement, perfusion, spectroscopy, mass effect, or hemorrhage. I’ll translate it into plain English and suggest what it likely means for symptoms and next steps.",

    "question": "Sex: M Age 48 Weight 235lbs Height: 6ft 2\" non smoker, non drinker epilepsy since birth, had his hemispheres separated about 15 years ago. Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re both going through this. What you’re describing is not “just how epilepsy is.” Worsening seizure control and very long events/post‑ictal periods need a re‑evaluation and a more proactive plan.\n\nKey points from what you shared\n- A convulsive seizure lasting >5 minutes is a medical emergency (status epilepticus). A 15‑minute convulsion and 5‑hour post‑ictal period warrant urgent attention and a home rescue plan.\n- Headache before a seizure is common and can be part of the seizure (aura/ictal headache). Pain relievers often won’t help because it’s neurologic, not typical migraine or tension headache.\n- If seizures have worsened despite medication increases over years, he likely meets criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy (failure of 2 appropriate anti‑seizure meds). That calls for referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center.\n\nWhat to do next\n1) Ask for referral to an epileptologist (comprehensive epilepsy center, Level 3/4)\n   - Review seizure types, frequency, and the headaches that precede them.\n   - Long‑term video EEG monitoring to clarify seizure onset.\n   - MRI brain with epilepsy protocol (more informative than CT; calcification being “unchanged” is reassuring but MRI can show more).\n   - Labs: carbamazepine (Tegretol) trough level, CBC, CMP/LFTs, sodium (carbamazepine can cause low sodium), and med interaction review.\n   - Strongly consider a sleep study—obstructive sleep apnea is common, worsens seizures and headaches, and is treatable. His BMI (~30) puts him at risk.\n\n2) Get a home rescue medication and written seizure action plan\n   - Options: intranasal midazolam (Nayzilam), intranasal diazepam (Valtoco), rectal diazepam (Diastat), or clonazepam ODT—your neurologist will choose and dose.\n   - When to use: if a convulsive seizure lasts 2–3 minutes, if he has a known pattern of clusters, or at the onset of his “warning” headache if his epileptologist advises.\n   - Call 911 if seizure lasts >5 minutes, if another starts without recovery, if color/breathing is abnormal, if injury occurs, or if recovery is not progressing.\n\n3) Reassess daily medications\n   - Ensure adherence and consider extended‑release carbamazepine to reduce peaks/troughs.\n   - Consider adding/switching to other agents if appropriate (commonly used: levetiracetam, lamotrigine, lacosamide, topiramate, zonisamide, valproate—choice depends on his seizure type and side‑effects).\n   - Antidepressant check: avoid bupropion and most tricyclics (they lower seizure threshold). SSRIs like sertraline or citalopram are generally preferred. Bring the exact name/dose of his antidepressant to the visit.\n   - Review all meds/supplements for interactions (carbamazepine affects many drugs).\n\n4) Consider advanced therapies if drugs aren’t enough\n   - Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS, if seizures start from a limited area), or deep brain stimulation (DBS, ANT).\n   - Dietary therapies (ketogenic or modified Atkins) under medical supervision.\n\n5) Use the headache as a warning sign\n   - Track in a seizure diary: time of headache onset, seizure timing, rescue use, sleep, illness, missed doses.\n   - If it’s a consistent warning, your specialist may allow preemptive rescue medication to prevent a big seizure.\n\n6) Safety and SUDEP risk reduction\n   - Strict medication adherence; good sleep; treat sleep apnea; avoid missed doses/illness triggers; hydration.\n   - Don’t bathe or swim alone; use a shower chair; avoid ladders/heights; have a medical alert ID.\n   - Nighttime supervision or a seizure‑alert device may help.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now\n- Any new or different type of seizure, persistent severe headache with fever/neck stiffness, new weakness or speech/vision changes, repeated seizures without full recovery, or another seizure >5 minutes.\n\nYou’re doing the right things by noticing patterns and advocating for him. Ask his neurologist for:\n- A referral to an epilepsy center/epileptologist\n- A home rescue medication and written seizure action plan\n- Updated MRI with epilepsy protocol, prolonged video EEG, bloodwork including carbamazepine level and sodium\n- A review of his antidepressant and all other meds for safety with seizures\n- Screening for sleep apnea\n\nIf you want, share the antidepressant name and his current carbamazepine dose/formulation, plus how often the “warning” headache occurs, and I can help you prepare specific questions for the visit.",

    "question": "i'm a caucasian 23 year old female, 5'6\" 115 lbs, taking oral BC, trintellix, vyvanse, keppra, and ranitidine (yeah, i kno). things like this have been going on for as long as i can remember. other than the fact that i'm epileptic, i really don't have any other underlying physical conditions that, to my knowledge, would cause this issue. i'm not really active unless you count standing around at work all day. i don't drink, smoke, or do any illicit drugs. i vape though...shhhh.so basically, i'm having what the title says. and when i mean constant, multiple times per day, anywhere on the body, with physical exertion or without.for example, today, i reached behind me to close a damn sliding cabinet door and got a wicked charley horse in my tricep. it throbbed for a few hours after. i'll lean my body to one side, maybe to reach for something further away and i'll get horrible contractions around my neck, upper back, shoulders, you name it. from seemingly normal and not excessively exerting actions.other times, i'll be sitting cross legged in bed, looking at reddit, and out of nowhere, my foot will flip out and the muscle that runs along the tendon on the bottom of the foot will tense like crazy and i'll have to stop what i'm doing to try to relax it, because as i'm sure a lot of people know, charley horses kinda continue to contract unless you move the body part in the opposite way or whatnot.i will get painful muscle contractions ANYWHERE. i get them in my throat muscles if i swallow something funny. i'll get them in my uterus (indiscriminate to my cycle and it feels way different than menstrual cramps). i'll get them in my BUTTHOLE MUSCLES. those are absolutely horrendous because i'll be in excruciating pain for 10-30 seconds and kind of have to position myself around and hold my breath until they relax. i get them in my fingers, wrists, calves, thighs, upper and lower abdomen, pretty much anywhere there's muscle.feel free to ask any other relative questions. i'm really just looking for insight and if anyone else is familiar with something like this.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—frequent, painful cramps all over your body are exhausting and scary. What you’re describing sounds like a generalized “muscle hyperexcitability/cramp” pattern. There are several common and a few less-common causes worth checking, and some practical steps you can try now.\n\nCommon, fixable causes to rule out first\n- Electrolyte issues: low magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium; dehydration.\n- Endocrine/vitamin: low vitamin D, low B12, low iron/ferritin; thyroid problems (hypo or hyper); less commonly parathyroid issues.\n- Medications:\n  - Vyvanse can reduce appetite and fluid intake, cause dehydration, and occasionally cramps.\n  - Trintellix (like SSRIs) can rarely cause low sodium and muscle cramping.\n  - Long-term acid reducers (ranitidine) can reduce B12 absorption.\n- Lifestyle: low total calorie/protein intake, not hydrating enough, long periods of standing without movement, caffeine/nicotine (vaping) causing vasoconstriction.\n- Benign but painful functional spasms: proctalgia fugax (sharp anal sphincter spasm), pelvic floor spasm, cricopharyngeal/throat spasm—these match parts of your description.\n\nLess common but important considerations (especially if tests above are normal)\n- Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (cramp-fasciculation syndrome/Isaacs): cramps triggered by movement or at rest, sometimes with visible rippling or twitching.\n- Non-dystrophic myotonias (channelopathies): stiffness/cramps triggered by movement or cold (often lifelong).\n- Other neuromuscular or metabolic disorders (would usually come with progressive weakness, exercise intolerance, dark urine, or abnormal labs).\n\nWhat to do now\n- Hydration and electrolytes:\n  - Aim for pale-yellow urine. Consider an electrolyte drink (not just water) during the day, especially at work.\n  - Ensure regular meals with protein and potassium-rich foods (leafy greens, beans, potatoes, bananas) unless you have kidney issues.\n- Magnesium: Many people with frequent cramps benefit.\n  - Try magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg at night (start low; can cause loose stools). Check with your clinician first if you have kidney disease or are pregnant.\n- Daily stretching/mobility:\n  - 5–10 minutes twice daily focusing on calves, hamstrings, quads, hip flexors, feet/arches, forearms/shoulders, neck.\n  - Brief dynamic stretches or movement “snacks” every 60–90 minutes while standing at work.\n- Heat and abortive tricks:\n  - Warm shower/heating pad to the cramping muscle.\n  - For foot/arch cramps: stand and gently dorsiflex the ankle, roll the arch on a ball, consider supportive insoles.\n  - For proctalgia fugax: warm bath/heating pad, knees-to-chest or child’s pose, slow diaphragmatic breathing. If episodes are frequent, pelvic floor PT can help a lot.\n  - For throat spasm: slow nasal breathing, sips of warm water, gentle neck/SCM stretches.\n- Review meds/lifestyle:\n  - Make sure you’re eating and hydrating adequately on Vyvanse; discuss dose/timing with your prescriber if you notice a clear link to worse cramps.\n  - If you’ve been on ranitidine long term, discuss switching (it’s largely off the market) and screen B12.\n  - Nicotine vaping can worsen vasoconstriction and cramps for some people—cutting back may help.\n\nAsk your clinician for these tests\n- CMP: sodium, potassium, calcium, bicarbonate, kidney function.\n- Magnesium and phosphorus.\n- CBC, ferritin/iron studies.\n- TSH (thyroid) and 25-OH vitamin D.\n- Vitamin B12 (and MMA if borderline).\n- Creatine kinase (CK).\n- If calcium is abnormal, check PTH.\nIf these are normal and symptoms persist, ask for a neurology referral and EMG to look for peripheral nerve hyperexcitability or myotonic disorders.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or progressive true muscle weakness, trouble swallowing/breathing, facial droop, severe calf swelling/redness, fever, confusion, or dark/brown urine (possible rhabdomyolysis).\n\nA few notes on specific symptoms you mentioned\n- Anal sphincter spasm lasting 10–30 seconds with severe pain is classic proctalgia fugax—benign but miserable; pelvic floor PT and warm baths help, and there are prescription options if frequent.\n- Uterine/pelvic cramping outside of menses can be pelvic floor spasm; pelvic floor PT is often very effective.\n- Random cramps with small movements fit cramp syndromes and electrolyte issues.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you share:\n- Any visible twitching (fasciculations), muscle stiffness on starting movement, or sensitivity to cold?\n- Diet/hydration on a typical workday and whether cramps worsen on Vyvanse days.\n- Any family history of muscle/nerve or thyroid issues.\n- Whether you’ve had bloodwork recently and any results.\n\nI know this is a lot, but starting with hydration/electrolytes, magnesium, gentle daily stretching, and a targeted lab panel often brings real relief.",

    "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",
    "answer": "What you’re describing sounds very much like focal (temporal lobe) seizures rather than “just” panic attacks:\n\n- Sudden warning, intense déjà vu, a rush of fear, autonomic symptoms (heart racing, breathing changes)\n- Impaired awareness/amnesia for parts of the event\n- Confusion and exhaustion afterward\n- Episodes occurring out of sleep\n- Stereotyped spells happening in clusters (you had 5+ in a day)\n\nPanic attacks rarely occur from sleep, usually last longer with full recall, and don’t cause the typical brief impairment of awareness and post-event confusion that seizures do. Anxiety can still be part of the picture—fear can be an aura of a temporal lobe seizure, and panic can follow—but the overall pattern sounds like breakthrough focal seizures.\n\nWhy this matters now\n- Having several spells in 24 hours is a seizure cluster and needs prompt medical attention.\n- If these continue, or you can’t reach your neurologist today, go to urgent care or the ER.\n- Go to the ER immediately if any spell lasts longer than 5 minutes, you have repeated events without full recovery, you’re injured, pregnant, develop a new focal weakness, or have a head injury.\n\nAbout your medication\n- Levetiracetam immediate‑release is typically taken twice daily (common doses: 500–1500 mg twice a day). The extended‑release (XR) form is once daily, usually 1000 mg or more.\n- If you are taking 750 mg only once daily of the immediate‑release version, that’s likely underdosed and could explain breakthrough seizures.\n- Do not change the dose on your own, but contact your neurologist today to review dosing, adherence, and whether you need an increase, a switch to XR, an add‑on medicine, or a rescue medication (e.g., clonazepam ODT, intranasal midazolam) for clusters.\n\nCommon seizure triggers to check\n- Missed or late doses\n- Sleep deprivation\n- Illness/fever\n- Alcohol or recreational substances\n- Stress and hormonal changes (around periods)\n- New meds that lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, tramadol, some antihistamines, stimulants)\n\nSafety until you’re seen\n- Don’t drive or swim alone; take showers instead of baths.\n- Avoid heights, open flames, heavy machinery.\n- Let someone close know what to do: time the seizure, keep you on your side, don’t put anything in your mouth, call EMS if >5 minutes or repeated without recovery.\n\nNext steps your neurologist may recommend\n- Urgent medication review and dose adjustment\n- Consider EEG/video-EEG to capture an event, and possibly imaging if not up to date\n- Prescribe a rescue medicine for clusters\n- Discuss whether anxiety is also present and needs treatment once seizures are controlled (levetiracetam itself can cause irritability/anxiety in some; if that’s an issue, there are strategies or alternative meds)\n\nA note on duration: focal seizures themselves usually last seconds to a few minutes; the “hour” you feel unwell likely includes post‑ictal confusion and anxiety. If you are continuously altered for close to an hour, that’s an emergency.\n\nA few quick questions to help:\n- Are you taking levetiracetam 750 mg once daily or twice daily? Is it immediate‑release or XR?\n- Any missed or late doses recently?\n- Any new medications, supplements, or recent illness, sleep loss, alcohol?\n- Has anyone witnessed these episodes? Do they notice staring, unresponsiveness, lip smacking, hand picking, or you not responding?\n- Do you have a rescue medication at home?\n\nPlease contact your neurologist today. If you have more episodes today, or can’t reach them, go to urgent care/ER for urgent evaluation and medication adjustment.",

    "question": "Age: 18 ex: Female Height: 150 Weight: 51kg Race: Arab Duration of complaint: a week ny existing relevant medical issues: anemia Current medications: iron pills, beef liver pills, blood building pills. original complaint  When I inhale I feel like my brain is full and nourished and healthy, but when I exhale it gradually worsens and I become very lightheaded and dizzy, I’m talking about normal breathing rates, not meditation breathing or fast rapid breathing, normal breaths.. I can’t sleep because of it, it makes my brain feel like it’s about to fall, like it’s falling, and sometimes I feel my brain vibrating, sometimes I feel an electrical feel going through my brain and moving, it feels like something is gonna happen like a seizure cause it feels like theres too much, like a sudden gush or surge of chemicals or something rushing into my brain and it’s gonna make me have a seizure or something, im not epileptic but there are times when I wake up my body is completely jerking non stop and uncontrollable, my jaw my hands, all of it, it lasts for seconds, and I can’t speak or make a voice, it’s like non stop jerking and twitching and shaking and my jaw constantly jerks along with my body, idk if this is related to what I’m feeling in my brain but iv had these “jerks” since a long time",
    "answer": "Thank you for describing this so clearly. A few of your symptoms are potentially serious and should be evaluated in person soon.\n\nWhy I’m concerned\n- Recurrent, whole‑body jerking on awakening with inability to speak could be myoclonic seizures (for example, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) or less often severe sleep myoclonus. These warrant a neurological evaluation and EEG.\n- The “electrical surges,” brain “vibration,” and marked lightheadedness that fluctuate with breathing can happen with anxiety/hyperventilation or dysautonomia (like POTS), but because you’re also having jerking episodes, it’s important to rule out seizure activity and other neurological or metabolic causes first.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Seek urgent, in‑person care: If you can, be seen at urgent care or an ER today/within 24 hours, or at least arrange an urgent appointment with your primary care clinician. Ask for:\n  - Neurology referral and EEG (a sleep‑deprived EEG is often helpful).\n  - Basic labs: CBC, ferritin/iron studies, electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium), glucose, thyroid tests, B12/folate.\n  - Orthostatic vitals (lying/standing pulse and BP) to screen for POTS/orthostatic intolerance.\n\nGo to the ER immediately if:\n- Any jerking lasts 5 minutes or more, or you have repeated episodes close together.\n- You lose consciousness, injure yourself, are confused after an episode, bite your tongue, or lose bladder control.\n- Severe or worsening headache, vision changes, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, stiff neck, weakness, or numbness.\n\nSafety until you’re evaluated\n- Don’t drive, swim alone, climb heights, or operate machinery.\n- Try to capture a video of an episode (with someone’s help) and keep a log: time, what you felt, duration, triggers, and recovery.\n\nAbout your current symptoms\n- Jerks on waking: Brief, shock‑like jerks shortly after awakening are classic for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, especially if worse with sleep deprivation or flashing lights. Some people only have these for years before a bigger seizure ever happens.\n- Breathing-linked dizziness: Anxiety or subtle hyperventilation can lower CO2 and cause cerebral blood vessel constriction → dizziness, tingling, and “electric” or vibrating sensations. Dysautonomia (including POTS) can also cause breath‑linked lightheadedness and “head rush” sensations.\n- Anemia can worsen lightheadedness and sleep quality; iron deficiency can also cause restless legs and sleep movement.\n\nPractical steps you can try (not a substitute for evaluation)\n- Breathing: Try gentle nasal breathing only. Inhale quietly 2–3 seconds, exhale passively (don’t force air out) 3–4 seconds. Keep the breath small and relaxed. Avoid big sighs or forceful exhalations.\n- Hydration and salt: 2–3 liters water/day and a bit more salt (unless you have a reason to restrict) can help if you have orthostatic symptoms.\n- Sleep: Prioritize regular sleep, avoid all‑nighters, alcohol, and bright/flashing lights. Screens off 1 hour before bed.\n- Iron: Continue iron as prescribed. Take it with vitamin C (e.g., orange juice) and away from calcium/tea/coffee for best absorption.\n\nAbout your supplements\n- “Beef liver” pills can be very high in vitamin A and copper; excessive vitamin A can cause headaches, pressure/fullness in the head, and vision changes. Until you’re evaluated, consider pausing them and use only the iron your clinician prescribed.\n\nHelpful questions for your visit\n- Do the jerks happen mostly in the morning? Any triggers (sleep loss, stress, flashing lights, alcohol)?\n- Any confusion after episodes, tongue biting, incontinence, or injuries?\n- Any perioral tingling or hand/foot tingling during dizziness?\n- Do symptoms worsen when standing and improve when lying down?\n- Family history of seizures or fainting disorders?\n\nIf you can share any recent lab results (hemoglobin, ferritin) or more detail about the jerks (timing, frequency), I can help you think through next steps while you arrange an in‑person evaluation.",

    "question": "So I’ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn’t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I’ve been having deja vu’s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I’m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
    "answer": "Short answer: Yes—what you describe is very consistent with focal (temporal lobe) seizures that sometimes spread into a generalized “grand mal” seizure. An MRI can be normal in temporal lobe epilepsy, and an EEG showing left-sided epileptiform activity supports it. You should try to see an epileptologist (a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy) and consider starting treatment rather than waiting further.\n\nWhy this fits\n- Typical temporal lobe auras: sudden nausea/“rising” feeling, déjà vu/déjà rêvé, fear, altered sound perception, and distortions of size/distance (the “ceiling far away, hands bigger” episodes are classic illusions that can occur with temporal/occipital involvement and are also seen in migraine).\n- Progression: A focal seizure from the temporal lobe can spread to both hemispheres and become a generalized tonic–clonic seizure (what you experienced).\n- EEG: Left-sided abnormalities (especially spikes/sharp waves in temporal leads) are common in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact wording on your report matters.\n- MRI: A normal MRI does not rule out epilepsy. Some causes (e.g., mesial temporal sclerosis or subtle cortical dysplasia) can be missed without a high‑resolution epilepsy protocol.\n\nAbout tonsillectomy/mono: EBV (mononucleosis) and surgery/anesthesia can transiently lower the seizure threshold, but they are not usual root causes of chronic epilepsy. AIWS-like symptoms have been associated with EBV and migraine, but your long-standing, stereotyped episodes plus EEG findings point more toward temporal lobe seizures.\n\nWhat to do next\n- See an epileptologist. Ask for:\n  - A 3T epilepsy‑protocol MRI read by an epilepsy neuroradiologist.\n  - Consider prolonged video‑EEG monitoring if diagnosis is still uncertain or to localize onset.\n  - If seizures continue despite 2 medicines, referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center for surgical/neuromodulation evaluation (PET/SPECT, neuropsych testing, etc.).\n- Start antiseizure medication (you’ve had ≥2 unprovoked seizures). Common first‑line options for focal epilepsy:\n  - Levetiracetam (Keppra): easy to start, but can cause irritability/anxiety in some.\n  - Lamotrigine: good cognitive/mood profile; needs slow titration and rare serious rash risk.\n  - Lacosamide: generally well tolerated; can affect heart conduction (PR interval).\n  - Oxcarbazepine/carbamazepine: effective; can cause low sodium and drug interactions.\n  - Choice depends on your health history, mood, other meds, and pregnancy plans if relevant. If access is delayed, ask your current neurologist or primary doctor to start therapy while you await the specialist.\n- Keep a seizure diary: date/time, aura features, duration, potential triggers (sleep loss, alcohol, illness, stress, menstrual cycle), medication adherence.\n\nSafety and lifestyle\n- Driving: Laws vary, but most places require 6–12 months seizure‑free. Ask your clinician about your local rules.\n- Water/heights: Shower instead of bath; don’t swim alone; avoid ladders/rooftops and operating heavy machinery.\n- Triggers to avoid: sleep deprivation, binge alcohol, recreational drugs; be cautious with medicines that lower seizure threshold (e.g., tramadol, bupropion).\n- Tell friends/partners what to do: turn you on your side, cushion head, don’t put anything in your mouth, don’t restrain, time the seizure, call emergency services if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, repeats without recovery, or there’s injury.\n- Consider a medical ID and, if you have nocturnal events, a seizure detection device. Good seizure control reduces risks including SUDEP.\n\nQuestions to bring to your visit\n- What exactly did my EEG show (spikes/sharps in which leads)?\n- Can I get a 3T epilepsy‑protocol MRI?\n- Which medication do you recommend for me and why? What side effects should I watch for?\n- What are my local driving/work/activity restrictions?\n- Do I need video‑EEG monitoring or other tests now?\n- If seizures continue, when do we discuss surgical/neuromodulation options?\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, I can help interpret the exact EEG/MRI wording and tailor medication pros/cons to your situation.",

    "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
    "answer": "Short answer: Eosinophils rise most often from allergies or a medication reaction; parasites are only one of many causes. At your age, with no travel and no allergy history, a medication effect is high on the list. The exact significance depends on your absolute eosinophil count (AEC), not just the percentage.\n\nWhy the percent alone isn’t enough\n- Labs usually report both a percent and an absolute number (AEC). The AEC = total white blood cell count × eosinophil percent.\n- Example: if WBC is 4.0 and eos are 22%, AEC ≈ 0.88 (880/µL) = mild eosinophilia; if WBC is 10.0, AEC ≈ 2.2 (2200/µL) = “hypereosinophilia.”\n- Please check your report for the absolute eosinophil count (often shown as cells/µL or x10^9/L).\n\nCommon causes to consider\n- Medications: very common cause. Anticonvulsants can do this. Topiramate has been linked (rarely) to drug reactions with eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and other hypersensitivity syndromes. Venlafaxine has rare hypersensitivity cases with eosinophilia. Clonazepam is a less common culprit.\n- Allergic/atopic disease: asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, eosinophilic GI disease (even if you don’t think you’re “allergic,” sometimes these are subtle).\n- Infections: mainly parasitic helminths; travel isn’t required for all (e.g., Strongyloides exists in parts of Europe/US), but without exposures/travel it’s less likely.\n- Autoimmune/vasculitic disorders (e.g., EGPA/Churg–Strauss—usually with asthma/sinus disease), skin disorders, adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s), and rarely blood cancers or hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nClues that point to a drug effect\n- New medication or dose increase in the past weeks–months.\n- Any rash, fever, facial swelling, mouth sores, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, liver test abnormalities, or kidney issues. If any of these are present, seek care promptly.\n\nWhat to do before your hematology visit\n- Don’t stop seizure meds on your own. Changing antiepileptics must be done carefully with your neurologist.\n- Ask your doctor for:\n  - A repeat CBC with differential to confirm and to get the absolute eosinophil count.\n  - Basic labs (liver enzymes, kidney function, urinalysis), total IgE.\n  - If there’s any risk/exposure, stool ova/parasite tests (often 3 samples) and Strongyloides serology.\n  - Consider a chest X‑ray if you have cough, wheeze, or shortness of breath.\n  - If symptoms suggest, tests for autoimmunity (ANCA/ANA) or morning cortisol (for Addison’s).\n- Make a medication timeline (including OTCs, herbal/supplements) noting start dates and dose changes for the past 3–6 months.\n- Note any symptoms: rash, fever, night sweats, weight loss, sinus/asthma symptoms, chest or abdominal pain, diarrhea, trouble swallowing/food getting stuck, new numbness/weakness.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Fever with rash, facial swelling, yellowing of the eyes/skin, dark urine, severe sore throat with swollen glands.\n- Chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing.\n- Severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting/diarrhea, blood in stool or urine.\n- Unexplained weight loss or drenching night sweats.\nThese can indicate a more serious drug reaction or organ involvement.\n\nReassurance\n- In a 26‑year‑old, persistent eosinophilia is most often due to allergy or a drug effect. Hematologic cancers and primary eosinophilic disorders are much less common but are the reason you’re appropriately seeing a hematologist.\n- Your “tingling” and low blood pressure are well‑known topiramate effects and don’t by themselves explain eosinophilia; Addison’s (which can cause eosinophilia and low BP) usually also causes fatigue, salt craving, abdominal symptoms, and abnormal electrolytes.\n\nIf you can share your absolute eosinophil count, recent medication changes, and any symptoms (especially rash/fever/respiratory or GI issues), I can help you interpret how concerning this is and what questions to bring to your appointment.",

    "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes, a form of “reflex” focal epilepsy is one possibility—but it’s not the only one, and what you describe can have several explanations. A proper work‑up would help.\n\nWhy epilepsy is on the list\n- Some focal (usually temporal lobe) seizures are very brief (seconds), can include a loud internal sound/ringing, a sudden “jolt/flash,” a brief “out of it” feeling, disequilibrium, and are sometimes triggered by specific cognitive/emotional stimuli (reading/music/thinking/remembering). These are called reflex seizures.\n- The link to vivid recall of the past, the sudden onset/offset, and the brief altered state fit that pattern.\n\nOther possibilities\n- Transient spontaneous tinnitus: very common, seconds-long ringing with brief ear fullness or slight disequilibrium; benign. Usually not tied to a particular thought, so the trigger pattern makes this less convincing on its own.\n- Migraine aura/vestibular phenomena: possible, but auras usually last minutes, not a second.\n- “Brain zaps” (often with SSRI/SNRI changes) or anxiety surges: can feel electric with a whoosh, but yours began in adolescence and have a specific cognitive trigger.\n- Exploding head syndrome: typically occurs when falling asleep/waking, not while walking around.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Ask for a neurology referral. Even if episodes are infrequent, your consistent trigger pattern and brief altered awareness warrant evaluation.\n- Likely tests: routine or sleep‑deprived EEG (sometimes ambulatory EEG if events are rare) and a brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol. If the sound is clearly one‑sided, an audiology/ENT exam can be added.\n- Keep a simple log for a few weeks: date/time, what you were doing/thinking, side of ringing (left/right/both), duration, any loss of awareness, balance issues, nausea, deja vu/fear/odd smells, and how you felt after.\n\nSafety and self‑care\n- Until you’re evaluated, avoid known triggers when you must be fully safe (driving, heights). If you sense one coming, pause what you’re doing.\n- Good sleep, regular meals, hydration, and limiting alcohol can reduce many neuro events, including seizures.\n- Seek urgent care if an episode lasts >5 minutes, clusters repeatedly, or is followed by prolonged confusion, weakness, new severe headache, or injury.\n\nTalking points for your doctor\n- Mention the specific cognitive trigger (recreating past scenes), the sudden loud internal ringing “like a bang,” brief altered state, and near‑loss of balance.\n- Ask specifically about “reflex focal seizures” and whether an EEG/MRI is appropriate.\n\nIf this does turn out to be a mild focal epilepsy, many people do well with trigger management and, if needed, low‑dose antiseizure medication.",

    "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes, you should be cautious, and you have a good reason to ask for a waiver or alternative.\n\nWhy:\n- Conducted electrical weapons (TASER/stun guns) typically cause brief, painful muscle contractions. They don’t usually trigger seizures, but there are rare case reports of seizures immediately after exposure, and injuries from falls are more common.\n- Many agencies and the manufacturer now discourage or prohibit “voluntary exposures” in training because the risk isn’t zero and there’s little added training benefit.\n- A past seizure disorder—especially after head injury—doesn’t mean you’d definitely have a problem, but it’s a reasonable medical precaution to avoid elective exposure.\n\nWhat to do:\n- Ask the employer if a voluntary exposure is truly required. Many departments now allow alternatives (observing a demo, video-based training, or cartridge-switch drills).\n- Request a medical waiver/accommodation. A brief letter from your primary care clinician or a neurologist stating your remote history of seizures after head injury and recommending you avoid elective CEW exposure is usually sufficient.\n- If, after medical advice, you still choose to proceed, insist on risk-reduction measures: no head/neck/chest probe placement, shortest possible exposure, done on a mat with you already supported (to prevent falls), with medical personnel present.\n\nGiven your history and the modern guidance around training exposures, it’s reasonable to avoid being shocked and to seek an alternative. If you want, tell me what device and setting this is (TASER with probes vs contact stun, duration, standing vs prone), and I can help you phrase a waiver request or questions for the employer.",

    "question": "I am a 23 year old women I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and other chronic inflammation about 8 years ago, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy, on top of that I have cysts throughout my body. I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I’m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing all of this. With Crohn’s disease, a new epilepsy diagnosis, and multiple cysts, it’s very reasonable to ask how (or if) these fit together. I’ll break this into two parts and add practical next steps you can take with your doctors.\n\n1) How inflammation relates to epilepsy\n- What we know:\n  - Inflammation in the brain (neuroinflammation) can both trigger seizures and be amplified by seizures. Key pathways involve immune cells in the brain (microglia/astrocytes), breakdown of the blood–brain barrier, and pro‑inflammatory signals such as IL‑1β, TNF‑α, HMGB1/TLR4, COX‑2/PGE2, complement, and the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n  - Certain epilepsies are autoimmune/inflammatory in origin (e.g., autoimmune encephalitis with antibodies such as LGI1, CASPR2, NMDA-R, GAD65; Rasmussen encephalitis; FIRES). These often respond to immunotherapy (steroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis, rituximab; occasionally IL‑1 or IL‑6 blockers).\n  - People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, including Crohn’s) have a modestly higher risk of epilepsy than the general population. Mechanisms may include systemic cytokines affecting the brain, vascular/inflammatory complications, metabolic/electrolyte issues during flares, and medication effects.\n\n- Crohn’s-specific contributors that can lower seizure threshold:\n  - Nutrient deficiencies from malabsorption: B6, B12, folate, thiamine, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D. Electrolyte abnormalities (low sodium, magnesium, calcium) and hypoglycemia can provoke seizures.\n  - Medications that can lower seizure threshold or cause neurotoxicity: fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin), bupropion, tramadol, theophylline, clozapine; high-dose or prolonged metronidazole can cause cerebellar toxicity; rare CNS events have been reported with anti‑TNF agents (e.g., demyelination).\n  - Fever/infections during flares.\n\n- When to consider an autoimmune/inflammatory epilepsy workup:\n  - New‑onset seizures in an adult without a clear structural/metabolic cause, especially if seizures escalate quickly, are medication‑resistant, or if there are additional symptoms (memory or personality changes, movement disorders, faciobrachial dystonic seizures, hyponatremia without another cause).\n  - What to ask about: MRI brain with and without contrast; EEG; basic labs including sodium, magnesium, calcium, glucose, CBC/CMP; vitamin levels (B6, B12, folate, thiamine, vitamin D); thyroid autoimmunity; CSF analysis if warranted; serum/CSF autoimmune encephalitis panels.\n\n- Treatment implications:\n  - Standard anti‑seizure medications (ASMs) remain first‑line. To minimize drug–drug interactions with IBD therapy, options like levetiracetam, brivaracetam, lacosamide, lamotrigine often play well with biologics and immunomodulators. Enzyme‑inducing ASMs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) can affect bone health and interact with other meds.\n  - If autoimmune epilepsy is suspected or seizures are refractory, discuss adding immunotherapy (e.g., high‑dose steroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis) with neurology; there are case-based uses of anakinra (IL‑1 blockade) or tocilizumab (IL‑6 blockade) in specific inflammatory epilepsies.\n  - Supportive steps: optimize sleep, avoid known pro‑convulsant meds, aggressively correct electrolytes during GI flares, replete vitamins (especially B6, B12, folate, thiamine, D), track seizure frequency vs. Crohn’s activity.\n\n- Search terms and leads to read about:\n  - “Neuroinflammation and epilepsy review,” “IL‑1β TNF‑α seizures,” “autoimmune epilepsy workup,” “IBD epilepsy risk,” “FIRES anakinra,” “LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis seizures.”\n  - Names frequently cited: Vezzani and colleagues (neuroinflammation and epilepsy reviews), Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance (patient-friendly resources), ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) position papers on autoimmune epilepsy.\n\n2) Could “cysts throughout the body” be related to inflammation?\n- Sometimes yes:\n  - Skin/hair follicle related: epidermoid/pilar “sebaceous” cysts, acne nodules, and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). HS is an inflammatory condition with recurrent tender nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts in armpits/groin; it’s more common in people with Crohn’s and is often described as “cysts.”\n  - Gynecologic: endometriomas are cysts from endometriosis (a chronic inflammatory disease). Simple/functional ovarian cysts are very common and not necessarily inflammatory.\n  - Mucous/retention cysts (salivary, Bartholin gland) can form from chronic duct blockage/inflammation.\n  - Around Crohn’s-affected regions: inflammatory masses, abscesses, or fistulas may be colloquially called “cysts.”\n\n- Often not primarily inflammatory:\n  - Simple kidney or liver cysts are typically congenital/degenerative and benign.\n  - Polycystic kidney disease is genetic.\n  - Breast simple cysts are common and usually hormonal.\n  - Arachnoid cysts in the brain are congenital; most are incidental and not seizure‑causing.\n  - Parasitic cysts (e.g., neurocysticercosis) can cause seizures, but this depends on travel/epidemiology and would be seen on MRI.\n\n- Practical steps to clarify the “cyst” picture:\n  - Make a list by location and type: skin, breast, ovary, kidney, liver, perianal, oral, etc.; how they were diagnosed (exam vs ultrasound/CT/MRI), and whether any were biopsied/drained.\n  - Ask for a unifying view: Some people have a “follicular occlusion” tendency (acne/HS/epidermoid cysts). Crohn’s can coexist with HS. If HS features are present, dermatology can guide anti‑inflammatory treatments that also overlap with IBD care.\n  - If any “cysts” are in the brain or spinal canal, or if you’ve had new focal neurologic symptoms, make sure MRI brain with and without contrast has been done and reviewed by neurology.\n\nActionable checklist to discuss with your doctors\n- Neurology:\n  - Confirm MRI brain with and without contrast and EEG have been done.\n  - Review seizure semiology and any red flags for autoimmune epilepsy; consider autoimmune encephalitis panels and CSF if appropriate.\n  - Choose ASMs with minimal interaction with IBD therapies; monitor sodium if using oxcarbazepine/carbamazepine; consider mood profile if levetiracetam.\n- Gastroenterology/Primary care:\n  - Check and replete: B6, B12, folate, thiamine, vitamin D; magnesium, calcium, sodium; iron studies.\n  - Review medication list for pro‑convulsant agents (e.g., fluoroquinolones, bupropion, tramadol) and metronidazole exposure.\n  - Bone health: vitamin D/calcium, and consider DEXA if you’ve had steroids or enzyme‑inducing ASMs.\n- Dermatology/Gynecology (re: “cysts”):\n  - Evaluate for hidradenitis suppurativa, endometriosis/endometriomas, and clarify which cysts are inflammatory vs simple.\n- General:\n  - Track seizure frequency and Crohn’s symptom activity side‑by‑side to see if flares correlate.\n  - Bring a concise list of all cyst locations/types to your next visit.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing:\n- What medications are you currently taking for Crohn’s and for seizures?\n- Have you had an MRI brain with and without contrast? Any mention of inflammatory changes or cysts?\n- What types/locations of cysts have been identified?\n- Any recent vitamin/electrolyte labs?\n\nWith those details, I can help you and your clinicians refine the workup and the most compatible treatment options.",

    "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",
    "answer": "Short answer: “Selenica‑R 40%” in Japan is valproic acid/sodium valproate. Although best known for epilepsy, it’s also used for migraine prevention and some movement disorders (myoclonus/tremor). If your doctor suspects vestibular migraine or a movement‑disorder component to your symptoms, a valproate trial is within the realm of reasonable options. That said, you should understand the target diagnosis, the plan, and the monitoring because valproate has important side effects.\n\nWhy your doctor might choose it\n- Vestibular migraine: chronic dizziness (often “rocking/swaying/oscillating”), motion/visual sensitivity, +/- headache or light/sound sensitivity. Valproate is an evidence‑based migraine preventive.\n- Myoclonus/tremor or other movement symptoms: valproate can help certain myoclonic or tremor disorders.\n- Less likely but possible: mood stabilization if anxiety has a cyclic/mood component.\n\nPoints to clarify with your doctor (bring this list)\n- What diagnosis are we treating (vestibular migraine, seizure/myoclonus, essential tremor, something else)?\n- Expected benefits and timeline: what change should I notice, and by when (often 4–8 weeks at a target dose for migraine)?\n- Dose and form: “40%” is the syrup concentration; confirm your actual mg/day and how/when to increase or stop if no benefit.\n- Monitoring: baseline and follow‑up labs (liver function tests, CBC/platelets; sometimes ammonia if mental slowing/confusion occur). Ask how often they’ll check.\n- Side effects to watch: sleepiness, tremor, weight gain, nausea, hair thinning; rare but serious liver or pancreas problems, and hyperammonemia (confusion, lethargy, worsening balance).\n- What’s Plan B if this doesn’t help (e.g., topiramate, propranolol, verapamil, venlafaxine, nortriptyline, vestibular rehab therapy)?\n\nAbout your symptom pattern\n- Constant “off‑center/oscillating” dizziness plus speech difficulty and fine‑motor changes is not typical for a simple pinched nerve. It’s good you had a brain MRI and ENT evaluation; if not already done, consider:\n  - Neurology (ideally neuro‑otology or movement‑disorders) review.\n  - Vestibular testing (VNG/vHIT/calorics) if not done.\n  - EEG if there’s concern for myoclonus or focal seizures.\n  - If limb symptoms are prominent or progressive, a cervical spine MRI can still be useful, but it wouldn’t explain speech issues or global dizziness.\n\nPPPD vs vestibular migraine\n- Persistent Postural‑Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD): chronic rocking/swaying worsened by upright posture, motion, or busy visual settings; commonly helped by vestibular rehabilitation and SSRIs/SNRIs (venlafaxine often better tolerated than SSRIs). Valproate is not a standard PPPD treatment.\n- Vestibular migraine: can present primarily with dizziness +/- headache; preventives include valproate, topiramate, beta‑blockers, calcium‑channel blockers, venlafaxine, and tricyclics.\n\nMagnesium note\n- 2000 mg/day is a high dose. In Japan, magnesium oxide is often used for constipation, but chronic high doses can sometimes raise magnesium levels (especially if kidney function isn’t perfect) and cause weakness, low reflexes, and dizziness. Ask your doctor to check kidney function and a serum magnesium level; consider alternative bowel regimens (PEG, psyllium, lactulose) if needed.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- New or worsening weakness/numbness on one side, severe headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, severe confusion, trouble speaking that is clearly getting worse, or double vision.\n\nBottom line\n- Valproate (Selenica‑R) can be an appropriate trial if your doctor is targeting vestibular migraine or a myoclonus/tremor component. Make sure there’s a clear target diagnosis, a time‑limited trial plan with monitoring, and consider a neurology/neuro‑otology consult. If SSRIs weren’t tolerated, options like venlafaxine, nortriptyline, or topiramate plus vestibular rehabilitation are reasonable alternatives depending on the diagnosis.",

    "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds. Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
    "answer": "Short answer:\n- Yes, epilepsy can occur without an obvious cause.\n- Your mom’s cousin having epilepsy does not meaningfully increase your personal risk. His children have a modestly higher risk than the general population.\n- Most antidepressants, including citalopram (an SSRI), are considered safe in people with or without epilepsy. Some drugs do increase seizure risk, especially in overdose or when combined with other risk factors.\n\nMore detail:\n\nWhat epilepsy is\n- Epilepsy is a tendency to have unprovoked seizures (usually defined as two or more unprovoked seizures, or one with a high risk of recurrence).\n- Causes fall into broad categories: genetic, structural (head injury, stroke, tumors), infectious, immune, metabolic, or unknown. In about half of cases, no clear cause is found—this is often presumed genetic (inherited or due to gene variants) even when no structural problem is seen.\n\n“Can it happen for no reason?”\n- Sometimes yes. Many people have “idiopathic/genetic” epilepsies where brain structure is normal but the brain networks are more excitable. That’s not a personal failing; it’s biology.\n- A first-ever seizure can also be “provoked” by something reversible (e.g., alcohol withdrawal, high fever, severe sleep deprivation, low sodium, certain medications). Provoked seizures do not necessarily mean chronic epilepsy.\n\nFamily risk\n- General lifetime risk of epilepsy in the population is roughly 1–3%.\n- First-degree relatives (parent, sibling, child) of a person with epilepsy have about a 2–3× increase over baseline (still a small absolute risk, roughly 2–5% by early adulthood, depending on epilepsy type).\n- More distant relatives (like your mother’s cousin) do not meaningfully change your risk; yours is essentially near population baseline.\n- His children (first-degree relatives) do have a modestly higher risk than average, but most will not develop epilepsy.\n- Stronger inherited patterns exist for certain rare syndromes that typically begin in childhood; if the relative’s epilepsy began in early life or many relatives are affected, a genetics consultation may be useful for that family.\n\nMedications and substances\n- Can medications “cause epilepsy”? They don’t cause chronic epilepsy in most cases, but some can provoke seizures or lower seizure threshold, especially at high doses, overdoses, rapid dose changes, electrolyte disturbances, or drug interactions.\n- Higher-risk examples: bupropion; clozapine; tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine); tramadol; theophylline; meperidine; isoniazid (without vitamin B6); some antibiotics at high doses or with kidney problems (e.g., imipenem, cefepime, fluoroquinolones); stimulants and illicit drugs (cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA).\n- SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, escitalopram) and SNRIs are generally low risk and commonly used in people with epilepsy. Rarely, SSRIs can contribute to low sodium (hyponatremia) or, in overdose, seizures.\n- Alcohol: heavy use and especially withdrawal increase seizure risk. Smoking itself is not a strong direct cause, but it correlates with other risks.\n- Benzodiazepine or barbiturate withdrawal can cause seizures.\n\nTriggers (for people who have epilepsy)\n- Sleep deprivation, missed doses of anti-seizure meds, heavy alcohol use/withdrawal, acute illness/fever, flashing lights (a minority), stress, and metabolic problems (low sodium, low blood sugar) can trigger seizures.\n\nHormone therapy (HRT)\n- Estrogen can slightly lower seizure threshold, while progesterone can be protective. In practice, gender-affirming hormone therapy does not generally cause epilepsy. If someone already has epilepsy, hormones can influence seizure patterns; coordination between endocrinology and neurology helps if seizures are present.\n\nWhat you can do\n- Your personal risk appears low based on the family history you shared.\n- There’s no routine screening (like EEG) for people without symptoms. If you ever have a possible seizure (loss of awareness, convulsions, unusual spells), seek medical care promptly.\n- General prevention: protect against head injury, sleep regularly, moderate alcohol, avoid illicit stimulants, and use caution with known pro-convulsant medications (especially in combination). Discuss any new meds with your clinician if you’re worried about seizure risk.\n\nIf you want, tell me more about your relative’s age at onset/type of seizures and I can give a more tailored sense of familial risk.",

    "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really “off” and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel “off” again. So now, I’m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I’ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy “test” video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some “impending doom” throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- It’s normal for flashing lights to feel unpleasant or make you feel “off,” even without epilepsy.\n- Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is rare, especially with first onset in adults. Most people who feel uncomfortable with flashing lights do not have epilepsy.\n- Watching a flashing “test” video does not make you develop epilepsy or make you more susceptible in the future. At most, it could trigger a seizure in someone who is already predisposed.\n\nMore detail\n- How common is PSE? About 3% of people with epilepsy are photosensitive, and epilepsy itself affects about 1% of the population. New-onset photosensitive epilepsy in a 31-year-old with no prior seizures is uncommon.\n- What you felt: discomfort, unease, and “impending doom” can happen with intense visual stimuli, anxiety/panic, migraine, motion sensitivity/vestibular issues, or simple eyestrain. Those are not seizures.\n- What a photosensitive seizure typically looks like: sudden loss of awareness, rhythmic jerking, staring spells, eyelid fluttering, or convulsions—often within seconds of the flicker. You didn’t describe anything like that.\n\nTesting\n- If you’re concerned, a neurologist can do an EEG with intermittent photic stimulation. This is the standard, safe way to check for photosensitivity. You don’t need to keep self-testing with provocative videos.\n\nWhat to do now\n- You did not increase your long-term risk by watching the video.\n- If flashing images bother you:\n  - Watch in a well-lit room and lower screen brightness/contrast.\n  - Sit farther back; use a smaller screen when possible.\n  - Skip or look away from strobe scenes; don’t force yourself to watch them.\n  - Consider tinted lenses if you also get light-triggered headaches (FL-41 for migraine photophobia). For true PSE, certain blue-tinted lenses can help, but evidence varies.\n  - If suddenly exposed to intense flashing, covering one eye or looking away can reduce stimulation.\n- Seek medical care urgently if you ever have:\n  - A first seizure (loss of awareness, convulsions, or confusion afterward),\n  - Repetitive jerks you can’t control,\n  - A seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, or injury during an episode.\n\nIf you’d like, I can outline how to prepare for a neurology visit or what an EEG appointment is like.",

    "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes, this deserves prompt re‑evaluation. A normal MRI does not rule out temporal lobe epilepsy, and the increase to three episodes in a day is concerning.\n\nWhy MRI can be normal\n- MRI looks for structural causes (scars, tumors, malformations). Many people with temporal lobe epilepsy have a normal MRI, especially if it wasn’t a high‑resolution “epilepsy protocol” MRI. Diagnosis is clinical plus EEG.\n- Even EEGs between events can be normal; prolonged or video EEG is often needed to capture an episode.\n\nWhy your description fits focal (temporal) seizures\n- Brief spells (1–2 minutes) with déjà vu, rapid memory “flashbacks,” feeling “zoned out,” nausea/hot flush, slurred speech, visual changes, and post‑episode fog are classic for temporal lobe seizures with impaired awareness.\n- Clustering (several in a day) can happen and raises the risk of a larger seizure.\n\nOther possibilities\n- Migraine with aura or vestibular migraine can cause dizziness, visual/speech symptoms and nausea, but auras usually last 5–60 minutes and déjà vu/rapid memory sequences are less typical.\n- Panic or dissociation can mimic some features, but the stereotyped brief episodes plus post‑event confusion point more to seizures.\n- Less likely but considered: cardiac arrhythmia, TIAs, metabolic issues.\n\nWhat to do now\n1) Contact your doctor or a neurologist/epileptologist promptly (ideally within a few days). Tell them the frequency is increasing.\n2) Ask for:\n   - Routine EEG (with hyperventilation/photic stimulation) or sleep‑deprived EEG.\n   - If negative, 24–72 hour ambulatory EEG or inpatient video‑EEG to capture an event.\n   - If MRI was not a 3T epilepsy‑protocol scan, request that.\n   - Basic labs (glucose, electrolytes, CBC) as appropriate.\n3) Discuss starting an anti‑seizure medication if your clinician agrees the events are likely seizures. Many people with probable focal seizures start treatment even before EEG proof.\n4) Safety until you’re evaluated and controlled:\n   - Do not drive; laws vary, but most places require a seizure‑free period before driving. Ask your clinician about local rules.\n   - Avoid heights, swimming/bathing alone, operating machinery, open flames.\n   - Prioritize sleep, avoid alcohol/recreational drugs, manage stress, don’t skip meals.\n\nTrack your episodes\n- Keep a log (date/time, duration, triggers, symptoms before/during/after).\n- If safe, have someone video an episode; witness descriptions help a lot.\n\nGo to urgent care/ER if\n- Any spell lasts 5 minutes or more, or you have repeated events without full recovery.\n- You have a new severe headache, fever/stiff neck, a significant head injury, persistent weakness/vision loss, or prolonged confusion.\n\nBottom line: Your symptoms and the clustering strongly warrant further evaluation for focal seizures despite a normal MRI. An EEG (often prolonged/video) and, if needed, a high‑resolution epilepsy‑protocol MRI are the next steps. In the meantime, follow seizure precautions and arrange prompt neurology follow‑up.",

    "question": "My current age is 31. Height: 5'7\" Weight: 140 lbs. I have been having convulsive seizures almost every month since I turned 26. These seizures almost exclusively occur within an hour of waking up. I walk around the house for up to half an hour, burning up. Could stress be a trigger for these episodes? I also have times where I get euphoric and nauseous, but they never last very long.Basically, what I want to know is, what is going on in my head. Is this temporal lobe epilepsy? Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—nine seizures in one day is a seizure cluster and a medical red flag.\n\nWhat to do right now\n- If you ever have: a seizure lasting 5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, trouble breathing, serious injury, or 3+ seizures in an hour, call emergency services.\n- Ask your neurologist urgently for a written rescue plan and a fast‑acting “rescue” medication (e.g., intranasal midazolam or diazepam) for clusters.\n- Do not stop Keppra suddenly; stopping abruptly can worsen seizures.\n\nCould stress be a trigger?\n- Yes—stress can lower seizure threshold, but the most common triggers for morning seizures are poor sleep/sleep deprivation, missed/late doses, alcohol (especially the day after), illness/fever, and abrupt waking.\n- Keep a diary of sleep, meds, alcohol/caffeine, stress, and seizures to spot patterns.\n\nWhat might be going on\n- The brief episodes of nausea and euphoria sound like “auras” (focal aware seizures), often from temporal or insular cortex; autonomic sensations like “burning up,” flushing, and post‑seizure wandering/confusion fit that picture too. Those focal seizures can secondarily generalize into convulsions.\n- The fact that convulsions are within an hour of waking also fits some generalized epilepsies (e.g., “generalized tonic‑clonic seizures on awakening”). Without testing, we can’t say if this is temporal‑lobe focal epilepsy with secondary generalization or a generalized epilepsy that peaks after waking.\n\nKey testing to clarify the diagnosis\n- EEG that includes sleep/sleep‑deprivation, or inpatient video‑EEG monitoring to capture an event.\n- High‑resolution epilepsy‑protocol brain MRI (3T).\n- Lab tests (electrolytes, glucose) and review of meds/substances that lower seizure threshold (bupropion, tramadol, stimulants, heavy alcohol, etc.).\n- If seizures started in adulthood and cluster, your team may also consider autoimmune causes.\n\nIf Keppra isn’t working\n- First, make sure the dose and adherence are optimized and that triggers are addressed.\n- If it’s ineffective or poorly tolerated, there are good alternatives. Choice depends on whether your seizures are focal or generalized. Broad‑spectrum options are safest when the type is unclear:\n  - Lamotrigine: effective for focal and generalized tonic‑clonic; generally mood‑friendly; must be titrated slowly due to rare serious rash.\n  - Valproate: very effective for generalized and focal seizures, especially morning generalized seizures; avoid in women who are or could become pregnant due to high birth‑defect risk; can cause weight gain, tremor.\n  - Topiramate or zonisamide: broad‑spectrum; can cause cognitive slowing and kidney stones; may reduce appetite/weight.\n  - Perampanel or clobazam: useful add‑ons for tonic‑clonic; perampanel can cause irritability; clobazam can sedate.\n  - Brivaracetam: similar to Keppra but sometimes better tolerated.\n  - If your epilepsy is confirmed focal, lacosamide, oxcarbazepine, or carbamazepine are effective; note carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine can worsen some generalized epilepsies, so classification matters.\n- After failure of two appropriate antiseizure medications, you meet criteria for drug‑resistant epilepsy, and you should be evaluated at a comprehensive epilepsy center for options like surgery (especially for temporal‑lobe epilepsy), laser ablation, or neuromodulation (VNS, RNS, DBS).\n\nSafety tips (especially since your seizures happen after waking)\n- Don’t drive until your neurologist clears you (laws vary, commonly require a seizure‑free interval).\n- Shower instead of bathing; keep the bathroom door unlocked; consider someone nearby when you shower in the morning.\n- Avoid heights, swimming alone, open flames, and operating heavy machinery.\n- Consider a seizure alarm/watch and share a seizure first‑aid plan with household members.\n\nHelpful details to share with your neurologist\n- Exact Keppra dose, timing, side effects, and adherence.\n- Any prior EEG/MRI results.\n- Sleep schedule and changes, alcohol/recreational drugs, new meds.\n- Seizure description from a witness: where you look first, head/eye turning, speech arrest, automatisms, duration, recovery time.\n\nIf you can, please tell me:\n- Your current Keppra dose and side effects.\n- Any EEG/MRI you’ve had and what they showed.\n- Any clear triggers (sleep loss, alcohol, missed doses).\n- Whether you’re on any other meds.\n\nGiven the seizure cluster you described, I recommend contacting your neurologist today or going to urgent care/ER if you can’t be seen quickly, to discuss a rescue plan and near‑term medication adjustment, and to arrange EEG/MRI and referral to an epilepsy center.",

    "question": "25 Male, 186 CM, 93 KG.I was happy that Johnson vaccine finally arrived at my country. However I started reading about it, there were some concerns reported last month that it may cause Neurological disorder and muscle paralysis.So as a someone who is treating from mild epilepsy (occurred to me only 4 times and usually my diagnosis are good) for about 6 years , should I be concerned about it ? also if I have the chance to take AstraZeneca should I do it ?Would appreciate your response because I can't reach to my Dr. at the moment",
    "answer": "Short answer: With well‑controlled epilepsy, you can get vaccinated. Epilepsy is not a contraindication to any of the COVID‑19 vaccines. The main precaution is that fever after vaccination can transiently lower seizure threshold, so plan for that. Between Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and AstraZeneca (AZ), both are acceptable and the serious neurologic side effects you read about are very rare. If an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) is available, it generally has the lowest risk of the specific issues you’re worried about.\n\nKey points for you:\n- Epilepsy and COVID vaccines\n  - People with epilepsy were vaccinated worldwide without evidence that vaccines worsen seizure disorders.\n  - Fever, poor sleep, dehydration, and stress can trigger seizures. Keep taking your anti‑seizure meds, stay hydrated, rest, and use paracetamol/acetaminophen if you develop fever or significant aches after the shot.\n  - If you’ve had status epilepticus or have a rescue plan (e.g., benzodiazepine), keep it handy as usual.\n\n- The rare neurologic side effect you read about\n  - This refers mainly to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a temporary immune‑mediated nerve disorder that can cause weakness or paralysis.\n  - After J&J, GBS has been seen slightly above background at roughly a few cases per million doses (highest in older men). After AZ, a small increase has also been reported, likewise a few per million. Most people recover with treatment. These events remain very rare.\n  - Both J&J and AZ also have a very rare blood‑clotting syndrome (TTS). The risk is higher with AZ than J&J and highest in younger adults, but still only on the order of several to a few‑dozen per million. Risk varies by country and age/sex.\n\n- Comparing options for a 25‑year‑old male\n  - If Pfizer/Moderna is available: generally preferred because they have the lowest risk of GBS/TTS. There is a small myocarditis risk in young men (on the order of tens per million, usually mild and resolving), but the overall safety profile is excellent and safer than COVID infection.\n  - If your choice is only J&J vs AZ: both are reasonable. Absolute risks of GBS or TTS are very small. J&J has a somewhat stronger GBS signal; AZ has a higher clotting (TTS) signal in younger adults. If you’re most worried about GBS, you might lean AZ; if you’re most worried about clots, you might lean J&J. Either way, the benefit of getting vaccinated far outweighs these rare risks.\n\n- Red flags after vaccination (seek urgent care if they occur, especially 4–30 days after J&J/AZ)\n  - For GBS: new tingling that spreads upward, progressive weakness, facial droop, trouble walking, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath.\n  - For TTS: severe or persistent headache, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, severe abdominal pain, unusual bruising or pinpoint rash.\n  - For seizures: any seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or repeated seizures without full recovery between them.\n\n- When to discuss with your doctor before choosing a viral‑vector vaccine (J&J/AZ)\n  - Past GBS (especially within 6 weeks of any vaccine), history of heparin‑induced thrombocytopenia, prior cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, known clotting disorders, or current thrombocytopenia. In these cases, mRNA is usually preferred.\n\nBottom line: Your epilepsy is not a reason to avoid vaccination. If you can get an mRNA vaccine, that’s the simplest choice. If you’re choosing between J&J and AZ, both are acceptable—pick based on which risk profile you’re more comfortable with and what’s available. Prepare for fever control and good rest after the shot, and seek care promptly if any of the warning symptoms above appear.\n\nIf you tell me what vaccines are actually available to you and whether you’ve ever had GBS, clotting issues, or heparin reactions, I can help you weigh the options more specifically.",

    "answer": "Thanks for sharing that. I can help with info and practical tips for living with photosensitive epilepsy. If you have a specific question (gaming, school, lights, meds, sports, etc.), tell me and I’ll focus on that. Meanwhile, here are quick, teen-friendly pointers:\n\nCommon triggers to watch for\n- Flashing lights (about 3–30 flashes per second), strobe effects, concert lighting, emergency vehicle lights\n- Rapid scene changes in videos/games, high-contrast patterns (stripes), bright light in a dark room\n- Flicker from some fluorescent or LED lights\n- Sunlight flicker (e.g., driving past trees/fences)\n\nWays to reduce risk\n- Sleep: Aim for consistent 8–10 hours; sleep loss lowers seizure threshold.\n- Screens and gaming:\n  - Keep room lights on (don’t use screens in a dark room).\n  - Lower brightness to a comfortable level; avoid very high contrast.\n  - Sit farther back and use smaller screens if possible.\n  - Take breaks (10–15 minutes per hour), and stop if you feel an aura.\n  - Disable “screen shake,” rapid flashes, or “strobe” effects in game settings if available.\n  - Consider accessibility settings like “Reduce Motion” on your device.\n- Lighting:\n  - Avoid strobes. Ask staff to turn them off if you’re somewhere that uses them.\n  - Try polarized sunglasses and a brimmed hat outdoors.\n  - Some people find precision-tinted lenses helpful (e.g., FL-41 or other specialist tints—ask your eye doctor/neurologist).\n  - If certain classroom lights flicker, ask to switch seats or have a bulb replaced.\n- If you sense a trigger starting:\n  - Look away immediately and cover one eye with your hand (reduces stimulation).\n  - Close your eyes and turn away from the source; leave the area if needed.\n- Daily habits:\n  - Take medications exactly as prescribed. If you miss a dose, follow your doctor’s instructions—don’t double up unless told to.\n  - Eat regular meals, hydrate, manage stress; avoid nicotine, alcohol, or drugs.\n\nSafety and planning\n- Seizure first aid for people around you:\n  - Time the seizure, protect your head, roll you onto your side, don’t restrain, and don’t put anything in your mouth.\n  - Call emergency services if it lasts 5 minutes or longer, repeats without recovery, there’s an injury, or breathing doesn’t return to normal.\n- Rescue medication: If you’ve been prescribed a rescue med (like a nasal spray), make sure parents/guardians, school nurse, and coaches know when and how to use it.\n- Medical ID: Consider a medical ID bracelet or phone lock-screen info.\n- School accommodations (504/IEP):\n  - Permission to wear hat/sunglasses, move seats, step out if lighting triggers, limit exposure to strobe-heavy videos, extra time if a seizure occurs, nurse access.\n- Activities:\n  - Swimming only with close supervision; showers are safer than baths.\n  - Helmets for biking/skateboarding; be cautious with heights.\n  - VR and some 3D or rhythm/flashy games can be risky—approach carefully or avoid.\n\nWhen to contact your neurologist\n- New or worsening seizures, new triggers, side effects from meds, or trouble with school/sports because of triggers.\n- If you want guidance on tinted lenses, device settings, or a formal seizure action plan.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- Your main triggers (e.g., certain games, classroom lights, concerts)\n- What devices you use (iPhone/Android, PC, console) so I can share exact settings to reduce flashing/motion\n- Whether you have a rescue med or seizure action plan—I can help you draft a simple one you can share at school and with family\n\nYou’re not alone—many teens with photosensitive epilepsy do great with a few adjustments.

    "question": "I’m (19M) 6 foot 2, 74kg. I’m on clobasam and tegratol for my epilepsy . Don’t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn’t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn’t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don’t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It’s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit! All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
    "answer": "Short answer: some people with epilepsy can have a small amount of alcohol without obvious problems, but binge or heavy drinking increases seizure risk for almost everyone with epilepsy. Your history of “getting away with it” doesn’t mean it’s safe for you; it likely means you’ve been lucky so far.\n\nWhy this matters for you in particular\n- Nocturnal seizures: Alcohol fragments sleep and reduces deep sleep, which is a common trigger for nighttime seizures. Risk is highest the night of drinking and especially the next morning (the “hangover/withdrawal” window).\n- Clobazam (a benzodiazepine) + alcohol: additive sedation, worse breathing during sleep, memory blackouts, higher injury/SUDEP risk after a nocturnal seizure.\n- Carbamazepine (Tegretol) + alcohol: more dizziness/imbalance, possible sodium drop (both can contribute), liver load; alcohol can also make people miss or delay doses.\n- Data: A sizable minority of people with epilepsy report alcohol as a trigger, and the risk climbs once you go beyond about 2–3 standard drinks, especially with 5+ (“binge” range). Seizures often occur within 6–48 hours after drinking stops, often after sleep loss.\n\nWhat doctors usually recommend\n- If you drink: aim for no more than 1–2 standard drinks, spaced out, with food, plenty of water, and finish several hours before sleep. Avoid binges. Do not mix with other sedatives or cannabis. Never skip or delay meds.\n\nPractical harm‑reduction if you choose to drink\n- Set a firm cap (ideally 1–2). Avoid shots/high-proof drinks. Alternate alcohol with water.\n- Take your meds on time; set alarms. Do not double up if you forgot earlier without calling for advice.\n- Prioritize sleep: finish drinking early; go to bed on time. Avoid drinking when already sleep‑deprived, ill, or stressed.\n- Night safety: don’t sleep alone after drinking if you can help it; use a seizure alert device if you have one; make the sleep area safe (low bed, clear hazards, lock doors/windows if you sleepwalk).\n- Medical ID and a plan your friends know (when to call EMS).\n- Do not drive if you drank heavily the night before or feel hungover; many alcohol‑related seizures happen the next morning.\n\nSigns you should tighten up or seek care\n- Any increase in nocturnal events, injuries, waking with tongue bites, muscle soreness, or confused mornings.\n- Missed doses, blackouts, or falls when drinking.\n- Symptoms of low sodium (headache, nausea, confusion) or liver issues (abdominal pain, yellowing eyes/skin).\n\nBottom line\n- There isn’t a subgroup of people with epilepsy who are reliably “immune” to alcohol’s seizure‑provoking effects. Tolerance up to 5–10 drinks without an event in the past doesn’t prove safety for the next time.\n- Given your nocturnal epilepsy and clobazam use, the safest plan is to stick to the 1–2 drink guideline and avoid binges. If that feels unrealistic, talk with your neurologist about a written harm‑reduction plan and night‑time safety measures.\n\nIf you want, I can help you translate “1–2 standard drinks” into typical pours for the drinks you usually have and help you set a practical going‑out plan that fits your routine.",

    "question": "21F. I pretty much have generalized hyperhidrosis but the sweating in my feet, hands, and underarms are what bother me the most. I’ve been looking into Iontophoresis but read that people with epilepsy might not be able to use this treatment. Anyone know anything about this? Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
    "answer": "Short answer: it’s a precaution, not an absolute “no,” but you should clear it with your neurologist first.\n\nWhat the warnings mean\n- Tap-water iontophoresis uses a low-voltage electrical current through the skin to temporarily block sweat output. It’s very effective for hands/feet and can help the underarms with the right pads.\n- Many device manuals list epilepsy as a contraindication or precaution. That’s largely out of caution; there isn’t strong evidence that peripheral iontophoresis triggers seizures. However, because it involves electrical current, manufacturers and clinicians are conservative.\n\nWhen it’s usually not advised\n- Uncontrolled or recently active seizures.\n- Any implanted electronic devices (pacemaker/ICD, vagus nerve stimulator, deep brain stimulator).\n- Significant cardiac disease, pregnancy, or metal hardware in the current path are also commonly listed precautions.\n\nIf your neurologist says it’s okay, safer ways to try it\n- Prefer pulsed-current devices for comfort and lower current density.\n- Start very low (for example 2–5 mA) and increase gradually only as needed.\n- Treat one area/limb at a time. For underarms, avoid setups that send current across the chest; many clinicians treat one axilla at a time.\n- Avoid use when sleep-deprived, ill, or if you’ve missed seizure meds.\n- Stop immediately if you feel any aura, lightheadedness, or unusual symptoms. Have someone nearby for the first few sessions.\n- Do not use if you have open skin, cuts, or metal jewelry in the water/path.\n\nOther options for hyperhidrosis\n- Topical: 20% aluminum chloride (palms/soles/axillae), glycopyrronium cloth (Qbrexza) for underarms, or sofpironium bromide gel (Sofdra) for axillae.\n- Oral anticholinergics: glycopyrrolate or oxybutynin (discuss side effects like dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision).\n- Botulinum toxin injections: very effective for underarms; also used for palms/soles.\n- Microwave thermolysis (miraDry) for underarms.\n- Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (surgery) is a last resort.\n\nBottom line\n- Many clinicians consider epilepsy a relative contraindication. If your seizures are well controlled and you have no implanted devices, some will allow iontophoresis with precautions. Get individualized clearance from your neurologist and a dermatologist familiar with hyperhidrosis before starting. If it’s not advised for you, there are several effective alternatives.",

    "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you were rushed in clinic—that’s frustrating, and these are very reasonable questions.\n\nShort answers\n- Does epilepsy increase the risk of “brain diseases” as you age? Not necessarily. Epilepsy itself is not usually a degenerative brain disease. Long-term outcomes depend mostly on the underlying cause, seizure control, injuries, and other health factors. People with well‑controlled epilepsy often age normally.\n- Are seizures (and partial seizures) bad for the brain? Brief, self‑limited seizures (under a few minutes) are not thought to cause lasting brain damage in most people. Repeated, very frequent, or prolonged seizures (especially >5 minutes or clusters without recovery) can be harmful, mostly because of low oxygen, metabolic stress, or injuries. So we do try to minimize seizures and avoid missed meds/sleep loss, but it’s about sensible risk reduction, not living in fear.\n\nMore detail you can use\n- Cognitive/neurologic risks over time:\n  - Most people with good control do not experience progressive brain damage from epilepsy itself.\n  - Some studies show a higher rate of mood disorders (depression/anxiety), sleep problems, and—depending on cause and age of onset—a modestly higher risk of later-life cognitive issues or dementia. Much of that risk relates to the underlying brain condition, vascular risk factors, and seizure control.\n  - Temporal lobe epilepsy can affect memory; long post‑seizure amnesia like you had can happen and may leave a permanent gap for that day, but shouldn’t by itself cause ongoing memory loss. If you notice persistent memory decline, tell your neurologist.\n\n- Seizure frequency and severity:\n  - Occasional brief seizures are unlikely to cause permanent damage. The bigger dangers are status epilepticus (seizure >5 minutes or back‑to‑back without recovery), injuries (falls, head trauma), aspiration, and SUDEP.\n  - “Partial” (focal) warning symptoms suggest breakthrough activity. They’re a signal to tighten triggers/adherence and discuss medication optimization. We still aim to minimize them.\n\n- SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy):\n  - Overall risk in adults is about 1 in 1,000 per year; higher if you have frequent generalized tonic‑clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, or miss meds. Good adherence and good sleep reduce risk substantially.\n\n- Triggers and practical prevention (you’re already doing the right things):\n  - Don’t miss doses. Use a pill organizer, phone alarms, automatic refills, or ask about once‑daily/extended‑release options if that helps.\n  - Prioritize sleep consistency.\n  - Manage stress: exercise, relaxation techniques, therapy if needed.\n  - Be cautious with alcohol and recreational drugs; keep hydration and nutrition steady.\n  - Keep a seizure diary (sleep, stress, missed doses, auras).\n\n- Safety:\n  - Head protection matters. Since one seizure occurred while biking, always wear a helmet; avoid riding if sleep‑deprived or after missed meds; consider lower‑risk routes. Follow local driving rules after a seizure (often a seizure‑free interval is required).\n  - Consider a medical alert ID and sharing a seizure first‑aid plan with people around you.\n  - Emergency rule: call emergency services if a seizure lasts >5 minutes, seizures repeat without full recovery, you’re injured, or breathing is impaired.\n  - Ask about a rescue medication (e.g., intranasal midazolam/diazepam) if you get clusters or prolonged seizures, or if your “partials” sometimes escalate.\n\n- Medication and long‑term health:\n  - Some antiseizure drugs can affect bone health (consider vitamin D, calcium, and bone density screening), mood, or cognition. Regular reviews help balance seizure control and side effects.\n  - If you had an 8‑year remission then a tougher seizure, it’s reasonable to recheck drug levels, sleep issues (including possible sleep apnea), labs, and consider an updated MRI/EEG to reassess the “anomaly” and refine the plan.\n\nQuestions to take to your neurologist\n- What is my exact epilepsy type and what is the “brain anomaly” (location, likely cause)?\n- Given the breakthrough seizure after 8 years, should we adjust dose, switch to extended‑release, or check drug levels?\n- Do I need updated MRI and EEG?\n- Can I have a rescue medication for warnings/partials or clusters?\n- What is my SUDEP risk and how can I reduce it further?\n- Are there restrictions on driving/cycling, and for how long?\n- Should I be screened for sleep apnea, mood disorders, vitamin D/bone health?\n- Would neuropsychological testing for memory be helpful?\n- What’s the plan if I have another aura or miss a dose?\n\nIf your provider can’t make time for these, ask for a longer follow‑up, a telehealth visit, or a second opinion with an epilepsy specialist (epileptologist).\n\nIf you want, tell me which medication(s) you’re on, how often you take them, and your typical day/sleep schedule. I can suggest a personalized adherence plan and questions to prioritize for your next visit.",

    "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I’ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I’m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I’ve realized there’s a lot of times in my life where I don’t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I’m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I’m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say “what” even though I can recall what they’re saying and I’m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I’m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say “why did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare”. So I’m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I’m probably overthinking this but I’m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing this—what you’re noticing is common and understandably confusing. A few points that may help while you wait for your EEG:\n\nWhat “zoning out” can be if it’s not epilepsy\n- Normal attention lapses/daydreaming: Very common, especially when tired, stressed, bored, or multitasking. A typical pattern is saying “what?” then realizing you did hear/understand—this is a normal processing hiccup, not a seizure.\n- Microsleeps: Brief dozing off (seconds) from sleep deprivation or sleep apnea. Often feels pleasant or “drifty.”\n- Anxiety/rumination, ADHD-inattentive type, and dissociation can also look like staring spells.\n- Migraine photophobia or sensory sensitivity can make flashing lights feel bad without it being a seizure.\n\nHow absence or other seizures usually behave\n- Typical absence seizures: abrupt start/stop, last 5–20 seconds, you’re unresponsive and usually don’t remember it; eyelid fluttering, slight head nodding, or a pause mid-sentence may occur. Childhood onset is most common; true adult-onset absence is uncommon.\n- Focal impaired-awareness (temporal lobe) seizures in adults: often 30–120 seconds, may have staring, speech arrest, lip smacking or picking, and usually some confusion or memory gap afterward.\n- Photosensitive epilepsy: flashing lights can trigger generalized seizures (sometimes in people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Often there’s a history of morning jerks or a past convulsive seizure, but not always.\n\nClues favoring non-epileptic spells in your description\n- You can sometimes recall what was said and even enjoyed the “good stare.” Awareness or recall during the episode is less typical of absence seizures.\n- No history of a clear convulsive seizure after 31 years makes lifelong unrecognized generalized epilepsy less likely (not impossible). That said, some people do have non-convulsive seizures for years before diagnosis.\n\nWhat the EEG can and cannot tell you\n- A sleep-deprived EEG increases the chance of detecting epileptiform activity, especially for generalized epilepsies and photosensitivity.\n- A normal EEG does not completely rule out epilepsy. If your history remains suspicious, your clinician might order an ambulatory EEG or inpatient video-EEG monitoring.\n- Tell the technologist exactly what your spells are like and that flashing lights bother you; they’ll do photic stimulation and hyperventilation safely.\n\nPractical steps while you wait\n- Keep a simple log: date/time, what you were doing, duration, awareness (could you respond?), movements (eye fluttering, lip smacking), triggers (lights, stress, lack of sleep), and how you felt after. If safe, your wife can record a brief video during an event—very helpful for neurologists.\n- Prioritize sleep, avoid alcohol/intoxicants, and minimize exposure to intense flashing lights.\n- Safety: until you have clarity, be cautious with driving if you’re having episodes where you can’t respond, avoid swimming alone or bathing (take showers), avoid heights, and use extra care with machinery. Driving rules vary by state—ask your clinician for guidance.\n\nPreparing for the sleep-deprived EEG\n- Follow the lab’s instructions about how little to sleep.\n- Wash hair; avoid hair products. Bring a medication list. Limit caffeine if instructed. Arrange a ride if you’ll be too sleepy to drive.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- A first convulsive seizure, any seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, injury, or new neurological symptoms (weakness, severe headache, trouble speaking).\n\nIf you’re open to a few quick clarifying questions, they can help narrow possibilities:\n- During spells, can your wife get your attention with touch or voice? Do you ever continue an activity automatically (typing, chewing) but can’t respond?\n- Any morning jerks or dropping things? Any history of a full-body convulsion, even years ago?\n- Do you snore or feel very sleepy in the day?\n- Do flashing lights trigger headache, nausea, or just discomfort versus clear episodes of unresponsiveness?\n- Any meds or substances that might lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, tramadol, high-dose stimulants, heavy alcohol use or withdrawal)?\n\nBottom line: What you describe could be normal attention lapses or another non-epileptic cause, but epilepsy (especially focal impaired-awareness seizures or photosensitivity-related generalized epilepsy) is still on the table. Your upcoming sleep-deprived EEG is a good next step. Keep tracking episodes, prioritize sleep, and discuss safety and driving with your clinician.",

    "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I’ve lost weight - I’ve always had a low appetite but I’ve always done my best to make sure I’m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I’m naturally pretty pale but my family say I’m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I’ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They’ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I’ll find out but I’m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don’t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it’s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be “anti convulsants except keppra” usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk thé dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day excepté 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- Your results show true iron deficiency (ferritin 14) and folate deficiency (serum folate 3.9), either of which can cause fatigue, pallor and feeling “washed out.” They can occur together even with a seemingly good diet.\n- Levetiracetam (Keppra) is not known to cause folate or iron deficiency and folic acid does not interact with it. Correcting these deficiencies should not worsen your epilepsy; if anything, improving anemia may help how you feel. No urgent need to call your neurologist unless your seizures change, but do let them know at your next follow‑up.\n- The thirst/overnight drinking isn’t explained by iron/folate deficiency. If diabetes was ruled out, ask your GP to look into other causes.\n\nWhy both iron and folate can be low even with a decent diet\n- Malabsorption is common:\n  - Coeliac disease: classic cause of concurrent iron and folate deficiency; worth screening (tTG‑IgA plus total IgA).\n  - H. pylori infection or atrophic gastritis; low stomach acid; inflammatory bowel disease.\n- Intake/absorption factors:\n  - Tea/coffee with meals, and calcium/dairy or antacids around meals, reduce iron absorption.\n  - Boiling veg can deplete folate; folate is highest in legumes, leafy greens, and fortified grains eaten raw/lightly cooked.\n  - Alcohol can lower folate.\n- Blood loss:\n  - Periods are a common cause, but yours sound light; consider occult GI blood loss if warranted (stool FIT/FOBT), especially if symptoms like heartburn, abdominal pain, or black stools.\n- Medications: Older antiseizure meds (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate) can lower folate; levetiracetam typically does not.\n\nCould this affect your epilepsy?\n- Severe anemia/hypoxia can lower seizure threshold, but your main risk is feeling more fatigued; treating the deficiencies does not interfere with levetiracetam.\n- High‑dose folate can reduce levels of phenytoin/carbamazepine, but not levetiracetam.\n\nWhat to ask your GP and what tests are useful\n- Start treatment now? Typical initial plan:\n  - Iron: 40–65 mg elemental iron once daily or every other day (e.g., ferrous sulfate 325 mg = 65 mg elemental) for 8–12 weeks, then continue 2–3 months after hemoglobin normalizes to rebuild stores.\n  - Folic acid: usually 1 mg/day in many countries; in the UK 5 mg/day is commonly prescribed for deficiency for 4 months.\n  - Your B12 looks fine; good to recheck if symptoms don’t improve.\n- How to take iron for best absorption:\n  - Take on an empty stomach with water or vitamin C/fruit juice; avoid tea/coffee, calcium/dairy, and antacids for 2 hours before/after.\n  - If it upsets your stomach, take with a small snack or switch to every‑other‑day dosing or a different formulation.\n  - Separate iron from all other medications by 2 hours just to avoid any chance of binding (no known issue with levetiracetam, but spacing is a safe habit).\n- Evaluate causes:\n  - Screen for coeliac disease (tTG‑IgA and total IgA).\n  - Consider H. pylori testing if you have upper‑GI symptoms.\n  - Review menstrual history and any GI bleeding signs; consider a stool blood test if indicated.\n  - Basic labs if not already done: full blood count with indices (MCV), reticulocyte count, iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), CMP (including kidney function and calcium), TSH, HbA1c/fasting glucose, and urinalysis.\n- Thirst/overnight drinking:\n  - If HbA1c and fasting glucose are normal, ask about serum sodium/osmolality and urine osmolality/specific gravity to assess for diabetes insipidus or other concentrating issues; also check for UTI, hypercalcemia, and review fluid intake patterns.\n\nWhat to expect\n- Energy usually starts to improve within 1–3 weeks of iron therapy; hair/skin/nail changes take longer. Ferritin often takes 2–3 months (or more) to replenish.\n- Plan to recheck hemoglobin in about 4 weeks and ferritin and folate after 8–12 weeks. Many clinicians aim for ferritin >30–50 µg/L to feel well.\n\nDiet tweaks that can help\n- Iron: keep up heme iron (meat, especially red meat), add vitamin‑C‑rich foods with meals; limit tea/coffee with meals. Don’t overdo liver (vitamin A).\n- Folate: legumes, lentils, chickpeas, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, spinach/kale (raw or lightly steamed), and fortified cereals/grains.\n\nWhen to seek care urgently\n- Chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, fainting, very rapid heartbeat, black/tarry stools, or any seizure change.\n\nIf you share a few more labs (CBC with MCV/hemoglobin) and whether you drink tea/coffee with meals or take antacids, I can help interpret further.",

    "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
    "answer": "I’m glad he was evaluated quickly and that you got clear information. Below are direct answers to your questions, based on current pediatric epilepsy practice. Of course, I can’t diagnose or manage his case—use this to guide discussion with his neurologist.\n\n1) How come the EEG was abnormal hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?\n- Many people with epilepsy have “interictal epileptiform discharges” (spikes/spike‑and‑wave) on EEG even when they are not having a seizure. These are markers of a brain that’s prone to seizures, not continuous seizures.\n- Abnormalities often persist between seizures and can be more likely to show up soon after a seizure and during sleep. They also wax and wane—an EEG can be normal one day and abnormal the next.\n- An abnormal EEG after a first seizure (especially generalized spike‑and‑wave) raises the chance of another seizure and is why treatment is often recommended.\n\n2) Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?\n- The EEG abnormality itself does not harm growth or development.\n- Most children with genetic/primary generalized epilepsies have normal development. Cognitive or school issues are more often related to the underlying epilepsy syndrome and sleep disruption, not the EEG per se.\n- One isolated tonic‑clonic seizure is very unlikely to affect development. Monitor school performance and sleep; tell the neurologist if attention or learning changes appear.\n\n3) Should we worry about an underlying cause? Do we need an MRI to look for scarring?\n- In a child with a normal neurologic exam and a clearly “generalized” EEG pattern, the chance of finding a structural brain lesion (scar, tumor, malformation) is low. CT being normal is also reassuring, though MRI is more sensitive.\n- Many pediatric neurologists do not obtain MRI when the clinical picture and EEG fit genetic/primary generalized epilepsy. Others obtain a screening MRI once for completeness. Either approach is reasonable; it’s not urgent if everything else points to a generalized epilepsy.\n- Red flags that would push toward MRI: focal neurologic deficits, seizures that start focally, focal EEG findings, developmental regression, or anything atypical in history.\n\n4) What is the realistic quality of life on Depakote (valproate)? What side effects do families actually see?\n- Efficacy: For genetic generalized epilepsies (tonic‑clonic, myoclonic, and absence seizures), valproate is among the most effective options. In boys, it’s often first‑line because long‑term reproductive risks matter less than in girls.\n- Common side effects families notice:\n  - Sleepiness or slowed thinking at the start or after dose increases (often improves over 1–2 weeks; taking the larger dose at night can help).\n  - Weight gain and increased appetite (common). Focus on diet, activity, and sleep from the outset.\n  - Tremor or fine hand shakiness (dose‑related).\n  - Hair thinning or shedding (uncommon, usually mild and reversible; zinc/selenium-containing multivitamin can help some).\n  - Stomach upset or nausea (take with food; extended‑release can help).\n- Less common but important:\n  - Elevated liver enzymes or lower platelets—usually detected on routine blood tests. Serious liver toxicity is rare at his age (highest risk is under age 2 or when on multiple seizure meds).\n  - Pancreatitis (very rare): severe persistent abdominal pain and vomiting—seek urgent care.\n  - High ammonia levels can cause lethargy or confusion; your doctor will check if symptoms suggest it.\n- Monitoring: Baseline and periodic labs (liver panel, CBC/platelets), and sometimes a valproate level after dose adjustments. Frequency varies by clinic, but often at baseline, 1–3 months after starting/titrating, then every 6–12 months if stable.\n- Day‑to‑day life: Most kids on valproate attend school, play sports, and live normally. The biggest quality‑of‑life issues tend to be weight/appetite and occasional tiredness.\n\nDose perspective for your son:\n- 37.5 kg; 250 mg twice daily = 500 mg/day (~13 mg/kg/day). That’s a low starting dose. Typical effective ranges are 20–30 mg/kg/day, so the team may raise it based on response, side effects, and blood levels.\n\n5) Can we avoid Depakote and use CBD or “no meds” instead?\n- With a first unprovoked seizure, the average recurrence risk is about 30–40%, but an abnormal generalized EEG raises the risk to 60% or more. That’s why many clinicians start medication after the first event in this scenario—to prevent more seizures and reduce injury risk.\n- CBD: Prescription cannabidiol (Epidiolex) has good evidence for Dravet syndrome, Lennox‑Gastaut, and TSC—not for primary generalized epilepsies. Over‑the‑counter CBD is unregulated (variable content, contaminants) and is not recommended as a substitute.\n- Important interaction: CBD plus valproate more often elevates liver enzymes; they should not be combined without careful monitoring by the treating neurologist.\n- If you wish to avoid valproate specifically, discuss alternatives such as levetiracetam or lamotrigine. They can work for generalized tonic‑clonic seizures, but valproate is generally the most effective across generalized seizure types. Choice depends on your child’s exact EEG pattern, seizure type(s), and side‑effect priorities.\n\n6) Should we get a second or third opinion? Another EEG?\n- A second opinion—ideally with a pediatric epileptologist—is perfectly reasonable for peace of mind, especially about starting valproate vs alternatives and whether to do MRI.\n- Bring the actual EEG recording and report for re‑review. Repeating a routine EEG isn’t usually necessary right away unless the new team requests it. The planned longer video‑EEG is valuable because sleep and longer recording increase diagnostic yield.\n\nAdditional practical suggestions:\n- Ask whether he should have a rescue medication (e.g., intranasal midazolam or rectal diazepam) and when to use it. General rule: call EMS if a convulsive seizure lasts 5 minutes, if there are repeated seizures without full recovery, or if breathing/color is concerning.\n- Safety:\n  - Never swim or bathe alone; showers are safer than baths.\n  - Helmet for biking/scooters; avoid heights and climbing without protection.\n  - Good sleep, regular meals, hydration; treat fevers promptly.\n  - Be cautious with strobe/flashing lights if he’s photosensitive; take breaks from screens.\n- School: Ask for a seizure action plan for the nurse/teachers.\n- Keep track of seizures, side effects, and triggers in a diary/app.\n\nWhat to ask the neurologist at the next visit:\n- Does his EEG show features suggesting a specific generalized epilepsy syndrome (e.g., absence, juvenile myoclonic)? Any history of brief morning jerks or staring spells?\n- Do we need an MRI at all, and if so, when?\n- Target valproate dose and timing for lab checks/levels.\n- Rescue medication plan and activity/sports guidance.\n\nBottom line:\n- His evaluation and the choice of valproate are consistent with common, evidence‑based care for a first generalized seizure with a clearly abnormal generalized EEG.\n- MRI is optional in this scenario; not wrong to defer, not wrong to get one for reassurance.\n- Most kids do very well—normal schooling and activities—with good seizure control. Side effects are usually manageable; keep open communication with the care team and monitor weight, energy, mood, and labs.\n- If you’re uneasy, get a pediatric epilepsy second opinion and share the existing EEG; the upcoming video‑EEG will add helpful clarity.\n\nIf you want, I can help you list concise pros/cons of valproate versus alternatives for boys with generalized epilepsy to take to the appointment.",

    "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett’s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don’t know what they’re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn’t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we’ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that “deja vu” feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn’t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don’t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I’m feeling down mentally. Today I’m still feeling crappy but I’m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
    "answer": "Short answer: it could have been a seizure, but sleep paralysis is also possible. Given your childhood epilepsy and the strong triggers you had (sleep deprivation, alcohol, high caffeine, and an evening dose of Adderall), it’s safest to treat this as a possible focal seizure until you’re evaluated.\n\nWhy it could be a seizure:\n- Deja vu “aura,” brief inability to move/speak (behavioral arrest), and very loud sounds can happen with focal (often temporal lobe) seizures.\n- Post‑event fatigue and feeling mentally “off” the next day fit a postictal state.\n- Triggers: lack of sleep, alcohol (and early‑morning withdrawal), and stimulants/caffeine all lower seizure threshold.\n\nWhy it could be sleep paralysis:\n- Occurred around awakening, eyes were closed, you couldn’t move or speak, and you felt vibration/loud sounds—classic for sleep paralysis.\n- However, the aura‑like deja vu beforehand leans more toward seizure.\n\nWhat to do now:\n- Do not drive, swim alone, take baths, climb heights, or operate dangerous equipment until cleared.\n- Avoid alcohol and high caffeine. Don’t take Adderall in the evening; consider holding it until you’ve spoken with your prescriber. Prioritize a full night of sleep.\n- Contact your primary care clinician or a neurologist urgently (within 24–72 hours). Ask for:\n  - Neurologic exam and medication review\n  - EEG (routine; consider ambulatory if normal but suspicion remains)\n  - Basic labs (glucose, electrolytes, magnesium) and, if you haven’t had one as an adult, a brain MRI\n- If you have another event, one lasting >5 minutes, repeated events, a head injury, persistent confusion >10 minutes, or any new weakness, severe headache, fever, or you’re pregnant, go to the ER.\n\nPractical tips:\n- Keep a log of any further episodes (time, what you felt before/during/after, sleep, caffeine/alcohol, meds).\n- If possible, have someone observe or record an event.\n- Avoid mixing alcohol with Adderall, and avoid late-day stimulant or caffeine use.\n\nIf you can share: did you have tongue biting, urinary incontinence, severe muscle soreness, or confusion afterward? Have you had similar “auras” recently? Those details can help your clinician.",

    "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",
    "answer": "I’m glad the topiramate is helping and that you haven’t had a seizure since October. What you describe from the accident (waking confused/agitated, being sedated) is common after a seizure. About the current pain:\n\nWhat’s most likely\n- After a seatbelt/airbag impact, the most common causes of persistent one‑sided chest/left lower rib pain are:\n  - Rib or costal cartilage injury (bruise, hairline fracture, or costochondritis). These can be very tender to touch and hurt with certain movements or deep breaths. Cartilage injuries often outlast bone bruises and can take weeks to months to settle.\n  - Intercostal muscle strain or nerve irritation from the trauma.\n- Less likely months later: lung contusion (“bruised lung”) or pleurisy from the accident. Those typically cause sharp pain with breathing and resolve over days–weeks. Ongoing “pressure” without fever/cough is less typical for pleurisy.\n- Other considerations to keep in mind (usually come with other symptoms): pneumothorax (shortness of breath, sudden sharp pain), pneumonia (fever, cough), spleen injury (left upper belly pain, sometimes to the left shoulder), or heart issues (exertional chest pressure, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating).\n\nRed flags that should prompt urgent care now\n- New or worsening shortness of breath, pain that’s severe or “tearing,” fainting, palpitations, blue lips/fingertips.\n- Fever, cough producing colored or bloody mucus.\n- Marked swelling or deformity over the ribs, or pain that’s rapidly escalating.\n- Left upper abdominal pain with shoulder tip pain, lightheadedness, or vomiting.\nIf any of these are present, go to an ER.\n\nPractical steps you can take now\n- Pain control:\n  - If you can safely take them: ibuprofen 400–600 mg every 6–8 hours with food, or naproxen 220–440 mg every 12 hours; or acetaminophen up to 1,000 mg per dose (max 3,000 mg/day). Avoid NSAIDs if you have kidney disease, ulcers, stomach bleeding risk, or are pregnant.\n  - Topicals: OTC 4% lidocaine patches or gel can be more effective than menthol for rib wall pain. Capsaicin cream can help some people.\n  - Avoid tramadol; it can lower the seizure threshold.\n- Activity and breathing:\n  - Relative rest, but do take 10 slow deep breaths every hour while awake or use an incentive spirometer if available to prevent shallow-breathing complications.\n  - Splint the area with a small pillow when coughing or sneezing.\n  - Gentle stretching and heat to the muscles after the first 48–72 hours; ice can help if it flares after activity.\n  - Sleep with the painful side up, a pillow under the upper arm to keep the chest relaxed, or on your back with a small pillow under the knees.\n- Time course: rib/cartilage injuries often take 4–8 weeks, sometimes longer for cartilage. Persistent pain beyond 8–12 weeks, worsening pain, or significant functional limits warrants imaging.\n\nLow-cost ways to get checked without full insurance\n- A plain chest/rib X‑ray and basic exam can rule out complications; many urgent care centers and imaging centers offer cash prices.\n  - Search: “self-pay chest X-ray near me” or “cash price imaging center [your city].”\n  - Ask about financial assistance/charity care at county hospitals or Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Look up “find a health center HRSA” for nearby clinics.\n  - Point-of-care ultrasound (in some urgent cares/ERs) can detect rib fractures and fluid around the lung and is sometimes cheaper than X‑ray.\n- If chest pain is persistent, an EKG is inexpensive and quick, and can reassure about the heart if symptoms suggest it.\n\nAbout your seizures and driving\n- What you described (deja vu, altered taste/smell, dissociation) fits focal seizures from the temporal lobe, but you still need a formal evaluation (neurology visit, EEG, and ideally a brain MRI focused on temporal lobes).\n- Laws vary, but most U.S. states require 3–12 months seizure‑free before driving, sometimes with a doctor’s statement. Please check your state’s DMV rules and do not drive until you meet them.\n- Keep doing what’s working: regular sleep, no alcohol/drugs, good hydration (important with topiramate), and take meds on schedule. Avoid medicines that lower seizure threshold (tramadol, bupropion, high-dose diphenhydramine, some tramadol-like cough meds).\n\nTopiramate reminders\n- Common effects: tingling in fingers/toes, word-finding trouble, taste changes, weight loss.\n- Stay well hydrated to reduce kidney stone risk; seek care for severe eye pain/blurred vision (rare glaucoma risk).\n- If you ever plan pregnancy, talk with a clinician early—topiramate has risks in pregnancy.\n\nA few questions that would help me tailor advice\n- Is the pain sharp and worse with a deep breath, cough, or certain movements, or is it a steady pressure?\n- Can you point to one fingertip spot that reproduces the worst pain, and does pressing there make it clearly worse?\n- Any shortness of breath, cough, fever, or abdominal pain on the left?\n- Does gentle NSAID or acetaminophen dosing reduce it?\n\nIf you share those details, I can help you decide how urgent imaging is and whether your current plan is reasonable.",

    "question": "Age: 16 Height: 5’3 Weight: 190 Gender: Female at birth but identify as male Medications: Onfi, Lamictal XR, Buspirone, Celexa, Quillivant, 5-HTP, Melatonin, Omega Fatty Acid, and birth control pills Smoking Status: never have and never will Existing Conditions: ADHD, Frontal Lobe Tonic Clonic Nocturnal Epilepsy, Aspergers, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,I asked my doctor if I was a candidate for brain surgery to get whatever part of my brain that’s causing seizures snipped out. He offered for us to do three tests. A pet scan, a cat scan, and an mri. Should I do it? I’ll have to have a seizure but I’m terrified of sudep. They said if there’s any signs they’ll probably be able to stop it. Still I’m terrified I’ll go through all this and it’ll be no use. I have frontal lobe nocturnal tonic clinic epilepsy. What do you all think? Is this a good idea? Should I go for it? Or should I stick with just adding medication? I’m 16 years old and I just want this gone. I’m so sick and tired of the fear.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Wanting your seizures gone and being scared about SUDEP is completely understandable. I’ll give you general information you can use to talk with your epilepsy team, but your own doctors know your specifics best.\n\nBig picture\n- If you’re still having seizures after trying two appropriate anti-seizure medicines at tolerated doses (you’re on lamotrigine XR and clobazam), that meets the usual definition of drug‑resistant epilepsy. In that situation, a comprehensive presurgical evaluation is the recommended next step. It doesn’t commit you to surgery; it’s an information‑gathering phase to see whether surgery or neuromodulation could help.\n\nWhat the tests are for\n- MRI brain (epilepsy protocol): looks for a structural cause (scar, cortical dysplasia, lesion). This is central to planning and has no radiation.\n- PET scan: looks for areas that use less glucose between seizures—can help localize when MRI/EEG aren’t definitive.\n- CT: often used for surgical planning (bone details) and to fuse with MRI/PET. Radiation is modest and generally acceptable when planning surgery.\n- Most centers will also do inpatient video‑EEG monitoring (EMU). They may taper meds to capture your typical seizures so they can see exactly where they start. This is standard and done with continuous monitoring, bed alarms, oxygen/rescue meds ready, and staff who respond within seconds.\n\nSafety during EMU and SUDEP concerns\n- Your worry about SUDEP is valid, but the risk of a fatal event during a monitored hospital stay is extremely low. Continuous observation, quick airway support, and rescue medication make EMU one of the safest places to have a seizure.\n- In the long run, the best way to lower SUDEP risk is to reduce or eliminate convulsive seizures. If the evaluation leads to better-targeted treatment (surgery, device therapy, or optimized meds), that can meaningfully reduce your risk.\n\nCould surgery help in frontal lobe epilepsy?\n- Outcomes vary by person and by whether there’s a clear, resectable focus:\n  - If there is a well‑defined frontal focus on tests, long‑term seizure freedom after surgery can be around 40–70%. \n  - If no clear lesion is found, chances of complete seizure freedom are lower, but many still see major seizure reduction.\n- If surgery isn’t the right fit, there are other options:\n  - Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS): FDA‑approved for people your age; can reduce seizures and improve quality of life.\n  - Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): usually approved for adults, but some centers use them in select teens.\n  - Dietary therapies (ketogenic or modified Atkins): can help some people with focal epilepsy.\n  - Medication optimization with blood level monitoring and interaction checks.\n\nImportant med and health points to review with your team\n- Birth control and lamotrigine: Estrogen‑containing pills can lower lamotrigine levels by up to ~50%, which can worsen seizures—especially around pill‑free intervals. Ask about checking lamotrigine levels and whether a different contraceptive (e.g., progestin‑only IUD/implant) or dose adjustments would be better.\n- 5‑HTP + citalopram + buspirone: This combo raises the risk of serotonin syndrome; 5‑HTP is generally not recommended with SSRIs/buspirone. Please discuss stopping 5‑HTP with your prescriber.\n- Stimulants (Quillivant/methylphenidate): Often safe in epilepsy, but let your team know; they’ll weigh benefits/risks.\n- Sleep apnea screening: Your BMI and nocturnal seizures put you at higher risk. Untreated sleep apnea can worsen seizures and may increase SUDEP risk. Ask for a sleep study if not done.\n- Adherence: Taking meds exactly as prescribed is one of the strongest protections against SUDEP.\n\nWays to lower SUDEP risk now\n- Aim for no convulsive seizures; keep a strict medication schedule; don’t miss doses.\n- Prioritize sleep and avoid triggers (sleep deprivation, illness, alcohol/recreational drugs).\n- Nighttime safety: consider seizure‑alert devices or a roommate/monitoring at night; people who are heard and turned from a prone position after a convulsive seizure have lower risk.\n- Have a rescue‑medication plan (e.g., intranasal midazolam) and teach family how to use it.\n- Treat coexisting issues (sleep apnea, depression/anxiety), and keep regular follow‑up with an epileptologist.\n\nIs it a good idea to proceed?\n- Given your ongoing seizures despite two anti‑seizure meds, a presurgical evaluation at a comprehensive epilepsy center is appropriate and often the best path toward seizure freedom or substantial reduction.\n- The evaluation itself is designed to be as safe as possible. Even if you don’t end up a candidate for resective surgery, the information gained frequently leads to a better plan (different meds/doses, diet therapy, or devices).\n\nQuestions to ask your team\n- Are you an accredited epilepsy center, and will I be admitted to an EMU?\n- What are the chances of finding a single, resectable focus in my case?\n- What are expected outcomes and risks for frontal lobe surgery in patients like me?\n- If not a surgical candidate, what’s your next‑best plan (VNS, diet, RNS later, med changes)?\n- Can we check my lamotrigine level and review interactions with my birth control and supplements?\n- Can I be screened/treated for sleep apnea?\n- What specific steps will you take in the EMU to keep me safe during seizures?\n\nYou deserve to feel safer and to have a plan that gives you hope. From what you’ve shared, moving forward with the presurgical work‑up is reasonable and often the best way to get you closer to seizure freedom. Bring these points to your neurologist, and consider bringing a parent/guardian to help take notes and advocate for you. If you want, I can help you draft a short list of your top concerns to take to your appointment.",

    "question": "Age - 31 Sex – Female   Height - 5'6\"    Weight - 120lbs Race – Caucasian Duration of complaint - A few days Location (Geographic and on body) - United States. Full body Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) – Epilepsy Current medications (if any) - Keppra, Prozac I recently went to the hospital due to a generalized dystonia attack. This is the first time this has happened to me. I also have temporal lobe epilepsy. I have been doing a lot of research and have recently started looking into deep brain stimulation for treatment of both. The Keppra I'm taking doesn't seem to be doing much. I have an appointment with my doctor coming up soon, and was hoping to get some information so I could have some good questions to ask regarding treatment, including DBS. Any other recommendations would be great as well. Thank you in advance for your help.",
    "answer": "I’m glad you have an appointment coming up. Given a first-time generalized dystonia episode plus known temporal-lobe epilepsy, it’s important to clarify exactly what happened and to map out a stepwise plan. Below is a concise guide you can take to your visit: what to ask, what workups are typical, pros/cons of deep brain stimulation (DBS), and other treatment options.\n\nKey points to clarify first\n- Was the recent episode truly generalized dystonia, a dystonic medication reaction, or a seizure with dystonic posturing? This matters a lot for treatment.\n- Any new meds in the last few weeks (especially anti-nausea meds like metoclopramide or prochlorperazine, antipsychotics, or stimulant/illicit use)? These can trigger acute dystonia.\n- SSRIs (including fluoxetine/Prozac) can rarely cause dystonia. Rarely, Keppra can as well. Bring a full med/supplement list.\n\nRecommended evaluations to discuss\n- Movement-disorders evaluation to determine the type of dystonia (primary vs secondary).\n- For dystonia workup (tailored to your exam/history):\n  - Medication review for drug-induced dystonia.\n  - Consider labs if indicated: copper/ceruloplasmin (Wilson disease), thyroid, electrolytes; sometimes genetic testing (e.g., DYT1/TOR1A, THAP1, GNAL) if generalized/early-onset or family history.\n  - Brain/spine MRI if atypical features or red flags.\n- For epilepsy optimization and surgical candidacy:\n  - Review seizure semiology, frequency, and prior meds tried.\n  - High-resolution epilepsy-protocol MRI, prolonged video-EEG monitoring; sometimes PET/SPECT/MEG and neuropsych testing.\n  - Determine if seizures are unilateral temporal (potentially curable with surgery/laser) vs bilateral/poorly localized.\n\nDBS overview specific to your situation\n- Dystonia DBS (typically GPi-DBS):\n  - Best results in primary generalized or segmental dystonia after meds and botulinum toxin fail. Response is often 50–80% improvement over months; strongest in DYT1 and earlier-onset cases; more variable in secondary dystonia.\n  - Risks: infection (about 3–10%), hemorrhage (~1–2%), lead issues, speech/mood changes, frequent programming visits, battery replacements.\n  - Onset of benefit is gradual (weeks to months), not immediate.\n- Epilepsy DBS (ANT-DBS):\n  - Approved for drug-resistant focal epilepsy (including temporal-lobe). Typically yields a median ~50–70% seizure reduction over time; rarely makes people seizure-free. Not a first-line “curative” option for unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy when resection/laser is possible.\n- One DBS will not treat both conditions. GPi-DBS helps dystonia, while ANT-DBS targets seizures. Some people can have both systems, but that’s more hardware and management.\n- Alternatives for epilepsy that may be better than DBS depending on your case:\n  - Medication optimization: options include lamotrigine, lacosamide, oxcarbazepine/carbamazepine, topiramate, clobazam, brivaracetam, and cenobamate (very effective for focal seizures). If Keppra isn’t helping, ask about switching to brivaracetam (similar mechanism, often fewer mood effects).\n  - Resective surgery or laser ablation for unilateral mesial temporal epilepsy (highest chance of seizure freedom).\n  - Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) for temporal-lobe epilepsy, especially bilateral or eloquent cortex; often achieves large reductions over time.\n  - Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) if other options aren’t suitable.\n\nTreatments to consider for dystonia before DBS\n- Acute rescue for attacks: diphenhydramine or benztropine (for suspected drug-induced reactions), benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), and sometimes IV anticholinergics in the ER.\n- Preventive/ongoing: trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, clonazepam, gabapentin; botulinum toxin for focal/segmental dystonia. A movement-disorders specialist can tailor this.\n\nTargeted questions to bring to your appointment\n1) About the episode\n- Do you think this was true generalized dystonia, a dystonic reaction to a medication, or a seizure-related dystonia?\n- Any signs it could recur or progress? What should I do acutely if it happens again?\n\n2) Workup\n- What evaluations do you recommend to determine the cause and type of dystonia (labs, imaging, genetic tests)?\n- Should we review or change any meds that could trigger dystonia (including fluoxetine or recent anti-nausea/antipsychotic meds)?\n\n3) Dystonia treatment plan\n- What medications or botulinum toxin should we try before considering DBS? What doses and timelines?\n- If DBS is appropriate, am I a candidate for GPi-DBS? What improvement could I realistically expect, and how long would it take?\n\n4) Epilepsy optimization\n- Are my seizures focal temporal and unilateral? Am I a candidate for resection or laser ablation?\n- If not a surgical candidate, which is better for me: RNS, ANT-DBS, or VNS—and why?\n- Which antiseizure medications should we try next if Keppra isn’t effective or tolerable? Could brivaracetam, lacosamide, lamotrigine, or cenobamate be good options for me?\n\n5) Combining therapies\n- If I need DBS for dystonia and a device for epilepsy, can I have both? Any device–device interactions or MRI limitations I should know about?\n\n6) Safety and life planning\n- What should my rescue plan be for severe dystonia or clusters of seizures?\n- Any interactions or cautions with Prozac and antiseizure meds?\n- For future pregnancy planning, which seizure meds are safest, and should I start folic acid?\n\nPractical tips before the visit\n- Keep detailed logs of events: date/time, triggers, video if possible, duration, body parts involved, awareness, recovery.\n- Bring a complete med list, including over-the-counter and recent short-term meds (especially antiemetics or new psych meds).\n- Note family history of movement disorders or early-onset neurologic disease.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Severe, sustained dystonia causing trouble breathing, swallowing, or severe pain; high fever or dark urine (possible rhabdomyolysis).\n- Seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, or any new neurological deficits.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- Keppra dose and how long you’ve been on it.\n- Details of the dystonia episode (what moved, for how long, awareness, triggers, meds taken around that time).\n- Your seizure pattern and prior meds tried.\nI can help you tailor the question list and discuss likely next steps.",

    "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
    "answer": "I can’t diagnose over chat, but I can give you a framework to discuss with her epileptologist.\n\nAbout the “side‑to‑side head movements”\n- In convulsive or “subtle” status epilepticus, motor signs can include forced head/eye deviation to one side, eyelid/facial twitching, nystagmus, jaw movements. Forced turning of head/eyes to the right is consistent with seizures from the left hemisphere.\n- True “side‑to‑side” (alternating “no‑no”) head shaking is less typical of focal epileptic seizures and can be seen in non‑epileptic movements, metabolic encephalopathy, or post‑ictal states. In ICU, drug effects and brainstem phenomena can also cause alternating movements.\n- The only way to be sure is EEG correlation at the time. Given she was in documented status epilepticus, it’s very plausible at least some of what you saw was seizure activity.\n\nWhat she likely had\n- The overall picture fits “new‑onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE)” with a focal (left temporal) onset. In young people, this is often preceded by a febrile illness and may be autoimmune or post‑infectious even when routine CSF/serum antibody panels are negative.\n- This overlaps with FIRES (febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome); adults can be affected. MRI can be normal early. Memory problems and a left temporal focus fit limbic involvement.\n- Many people with NORSE/FIRES or seronegative autoimmune encephalitis later develop chronic focal epilepsy, commonly temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which seems consistent with her current nocturnal focal aware motor seizures (head/eye/mouth involvement, eyes/head pushed to the right).\n\nCurrent seizures\n- Description suggests focal aware motor seizures, likely left hemispheric (head/eye deviation to the right). Nocturnal clustering is common in TLE.\n- She meets the definition of drug‑resistant epilepsy (ongoing seizures after adequate trials of two appropriate antiseizure medications).\n\nThoughts on the medication regimen\n- Levetiracetam 2500 mg/day: reasonable dose. Monitor mood/irritability.\n- Sodium valproate 2400 mg/day (~44 mg/kg/day for 55 kg): high dose. Monitor LFTs, platelets, weight, ammonia (if confusion). Major teratogenic and neurodevelopmental risks in pregnancy—this should be discussed explicitly, with reliable contraception. Consider whether valproate is still needed if other options control seizures.\n- Phenytoin 300 mg/day: monitor total and albumin‑corrected levels, bone health (vitamin D, calcium ± DEXA), neuropathy, cosmetic effects, drug interactions. Long‑term use is often de‑emphasized if alternatives work.\n- Adding lacosamide (Vimpat) is a reasonable next step for focal seizures. Points to discuss:\n  - Get a baseline ECG and avoid if significant PR‑interval prolongation or conduction disease. Caution when combined with other sodium‑channel drugs (e.g., phenytoin).\n  - If lacosamide helps, consider a planned taper of phenytoin or valproate to reduce polypharmacy and side effects.\n- Other options for focal epilepsy include: lamotrigine (slow titration, especially if on valproate), brivaracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, perampanel. If valproate is continued, be cautious with lamotrigine due to interaction and rash risk.\n\nImportant next steps to discuss with her team\n- Comprehensive epilepsy center referral if not already:\n  - Prolonged inpatient video‑EEG to capture current events.\n  - High‑resolution epilepsy‑protocol MRI (mesial temporal focus), and consider FDG‑PET or ictal SPECT if MRI is negative.\n  - Neuropsychological testing for memory/language mapping.\n  - Re‑review autoimmune work‑up (CSF and serum panels: NMDA‑R, LGI1, CASPR2, GABA‑B, AMPAR, DPPX, GAD65, etc.). Some cases are seronegative; repeat testing and oncologic screening (e.g., ovarian teratoma in young women) may be appropriate.\n- Because she’s drug‑resistant, discuss non‑pharmacologic therapies:\n  - Epilepsy surgery evaluation (even with normal MRI, left temporal onset can sometimes be localized with SEEG; surgery can be curative but has memory/language risks on dominant side).\n  - Neurostimulation (VNS; ANT‑DBS where available).\n  - Ketogenic/modified Atkins diet can help in NORSE/FIRES and refractory focal epilepsy.\n- Safety and rescue:\n  - Written rescue plan; intranasal/buccal midazolam for clusters or seizures >3–5 minutes.\n  - Optimize sleep, strict adherence, minimize alcohol/recreational drugs.\n  - Discuss SUDEP risk and consider nighttime seizure‑alert devices.\n- Women’s health/contraception:\n  - Valproate risks in pregnancy are substantial; this warrants a proactive plan (effective contraception—enzyme‑inducing drugs like phenytoin reduce combined OCP efficacy; consider IUD or depot options; folic acid supplementation).\n- Monitoring:\n  - Drug levels (phenytoin, valproate) and side‑effect labs (CBC, CMP/LFTs, platelets, ammonia if encephalopathy).\n  - Bone health (vitamin D/calcium; consider DEXA if long‑term phenytoin/valproate).\n  - ECG before starting lacosamide.\n\nDriving and legal\n- In NSW/Australia, driving requires a seizure‑free interval per Austroads guidelines (often at least 6 months for private licenses, sometimes longer). Nocturnal-only seizures still typically count. Confirm with her doctor and local regulations.\n\nBottom line\n- The initial illness looks like NORSE/post‑infectious or autoimmune limbic encephalitis with a left temporal focus, now evolving into drug‑resistant focal epilepsy. Lacosamide is a reasonable add‑on, but consider a plan to simplify therapy if it helps, given the high‑dose valproate and long‑term phenytoin. A comprehensive epilepsy evaluation (video‑EEG, advanced imaging, surgical/neurostimulation options) is warranted, and women’s health/valproate risks should be addressed explicitly. Bring your seizure videos to clinic—they’re very helpful.",

    "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing all of that—it makes sense to feel unsure after putting the pieces together. What you describe could be seizures, but there’s also a very common non-epileptic explanation that fits your triggers and timeline.\n\nWhat might be going on\n- Epileptic seizures: Two or more unprovoked seizures can meet criteria for epilepsy. Some people have very infrequent seizures.\n- Convulsive (vasovagal) syncope: Fainting from a strong vagal response to pain/needles or emotional stress can cause brief jerking that looks like a seizure. The triggers you describe (a painful baseball hit, ear piercing/needle) are classic for vasovagal syncope. People often feel a “prodrome” (aura-like warning) of warmth, lightheadedness, tunnel vision, nausea, ringing in the ears, then brief loss of consciousness with a few jerks, then relatively quick recovery. This is not epilepsy and is common in otherwise healthy young people.\n- A “concussive” event after a blow to the head can also cause a one-time seizure-like episode with very low long-term risk of epilepsy.\n\nClues that help tell them apart\nNone of these are absolute, but they guide your doctor:\n- Triggers: Pain/needles and emotional stress point more to vasovagal syncope than epilepsy.\n- Color and prodrome: Pallor, clamminess, nausea, tunnel vision, and muffled hearing suggest syncope.\n- Movements: In syncope, jerks are usually brief and irregular; in epilepsy they’re more rhythmic and longer.\n- Tongue biting: Side-of-the-tongue biting is more specific for epilepsy; tip of tongue can occur in syncope.\n- Recovery: Prolonged confusion (>10–15 minutes), deep sleepiness, muscle soreness, and headache are more suggestive of epilepsy; faster reorientation favors syncope. That said, feeling “spiritual” or unusually connected can occur after both and isn’t diagnostic.\n\nShould you be tested?\nYes—an evaluation is reasonable. Even if these were years apart, it’s worth clarifying so you know how to manage future risks.\n- Start with your primary care clinician; ask for referral to a neurologist.\n- Bring any witness accounts (even brief written recollections from people who saw the events).\n\nTypical evaluation\n- Detailed history and exam.\n- ECG to screen for heart rhythm issues (important because some arrhythmias can mimic seizures).\n- Basic labs (glucose, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium).\n- EEG (sometimes sleep-deprived or ambulatory) to look for epileptiform activity.\n- Brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol if seizures are suspected.\n- If vasovagal syncope is likely: consider a tilt-table test and guidance on prevention strategies.\n\nImplications depending on the result\n- If epilepsy is diagnosed: You’d likely discuss antiseizure medication, safety precautions, and driving rules that vary by region (many places require 3–12 months seizure-free before driving; check your local laws).\n- If vasovagal syncope: Generally benign and not treated with antiseizure meds. Prevention works well:\n  - Stay well hydrated, don’t skip meals.\n  - For needles/piercings/blood draws: lie down, warn staff, use “applied muscle tension” (rhythmically tense your legs, buttocks, and abdomen for 10–15 seconds, relax 20–30 seconds, repeat) to keep blood pressure up.\n  - Recognize your prodrome early; lie down and elevate your legs if you feel it coming.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Book an appointment for an evaluation. You don’t need the ER unless another prolonged event occurs or you have new red flags (chest pain, palpitations, prolonged confusion, focal weakness, head injury, pregnancy, fever/infection).\n- Until you’re evaluated, consider basic safety: avoid swimming alone, climbing heights, or bathing in a locked bathroom; showers are safer than baths.\n- If another event happens, bystanders should protect your head, turn you on your side, time the event, and avoid restraining your limbs. Call emergency services if the seizure lasts >5 minutes, breathing is impaired, or you’re injured.\n\nBottom line\nYou’re not making a big deal out of nothing—it’s smart to get clarity. Your two episodes, both with pain/needle triggers and years apart, sound more like vasovagal syncope with convulsive movements than epilepsy, but only a proper evaluation can tell. Either way, there are clear steps to prevent recurrences and stay safe.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a concise summary to bring to your appointment and a checklist of questions to ask.",

    "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I’d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",
    "answer": "Short answer\n- With your current anti-seizure medicines (valproate/divalproex and levetiracetam), clinically important drug–drug interactions with typical feminizing HRT are unlikely.  \n- The one epilepsy drug that reliably interacts with estrogen is lamotrigine (estrogen lowers its level), but you’re not on lamotrigine.  \n- Estrogen can be proconvulsant in theory; progesterone tends to be anticonvulsant. In practice, most transfeminine patients can start HRT without seizure worsening if it’s introduced gradually and sleep is protected.\n\nDetails\n\nYour current antiseizure meds\n- Valproate (Depakote): not an enzyme inducer; does not meaningfully reduce estradiol levels. Estrogens do not reliably change valproate levels. Main shared safety issue is liver: valproate has hepatic risk; oral estrogens increase hepatic protein synthesis. Practical step: check baseline liver panel and repeat after HRT starts and with dose changes.\n- Levetiracetam (Keppra): minimal metabolism, very low interaction potential with hormones. HRT does not affect its levels.\n\nHRT components and seizure risk\n- Estradiol (17-β): theoretical proconvulsant effect, but modern GAHT (especially transdermal patch/gel) produces steadier levels and rarely causes clinically significant seizure worsening. Avoid ethinyl estradiol (the pill used in many contraceptives) in GAHT; it has more hepatic effect and higher clot risk.\n- Antiandrogens:\n  - Spironolactone: no known effect on seizure control or ASM levels. Watch potassium and blood pressure. Dose earlier in the day to reduce nocturia, which can disturb sleep (a trigger for you).\n  - Cyproterone acetate (where used): hepatic risk; use caution with valproate. Not commonly used in the US.\n  - GnRH analogs: no meaningful interaction with valproate or levetiracetam.\n- Progesterone (micronized): generally neutral to mildly anticonvulsant; some clinicians add 100–200 mg at bedtime. Avoid abrupt on/off changes, which can cause hormonal fluctuations.\n\nWhat actually causes trouble\n- Enzyme-inducing ASMs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, high-dose topiramate, oxcarbazepine) lower estradiol levels and can blunt HRT. You are not on these.\n- Lamotrigine levels drop with estrogens (including HRT and many contraceptives) and seizures can worsen unless the lamotrigine dose is adjusted. Not applicable to your current regimen.\n- Sleep loss and anxiety are triggers for you; HRT changes, diuresis from spironolactone, or dose-titration periods can transiently affect sleep/mood. Plan proactively to protect sleep.\n\nPractical plan to start HRT with epilepsy\n- Prefer transdermal estradiol (patch or gel) if possible; start low and titrate every 4–6 weeks. It gives steadier levels and lower clot risk than oral.\n- Do not change multiple neurologic meds at the same time you start HRT.\n- Monitoring:\n  - Baseline labs: CBC, CMP (with AST/ALT), valproate level (total ± free if albumin low), and possibly a levetiracetam level to anchor your “personal therapeutic range.”\n  - Recheck valproate (and optionally levetiracetam) 4–6 weeks after starting estradiol and after any HRT dose change, or sooner if seizures change.\n  - Track seizures, sleep, and stress in a diary/app for the first 3 months.\n- Sleep/anxiety:\n  - Keep strict sleep schedule; consider front-loading spironolactone (e.g., morning/afternoon) to avoid nocturia.\n  - Be cautious with late-day Adderall; stimulants can fragment sleep and, in high doses, lower seizure threshold. If you need it, use early in the day and consistently.\n- Safety labs ongoing: LFTs and valproate level every 3–6 months during titration; potassium/creatinine with spironolactone.\n\nJuvenile myoclonic epilepsy specifics\n- Valproate is highly effective for JME; levetiracetam is also effective. HRT does not necessitate changing away from valproate/levetiracetam.\n- If seizures were to increase after HRT starts, the usual fix is modest ASM dose adjustment rather than stopping HRT.\n\nFertility and other considerations\n- If future biological parenting is a possibility, consider sperm banking before HRT (valproate can impair sperm parameters; estradiol/spironolactone further suppress fertility).\n- Bone health: valproate can affect bone; ensure adequate vitamin D and calcium, weight-bearing exercise, and check vitamin D levels.\n\nTwo quick clarifications to sort out with your clinicians\n- Your message lists “Keppra 1000 mg once nightly” and also “1 × 500 mg Keppra pill at night.” If you are on immediate-release levetiracetam, once-daily dosing is atypical; if it’s XR, once daily 1000 mg is standard. Clarify formulation/dose.\n- Target valproate levels for JME are often in the 50–100 mcg/mL total range (individualized). Knowing your stable baseline helps interpret any future changes.\n\nBottom line\n- Based on current evidence, feminizing HRT (estradiol ± spironolactone ± micronized progesterone) does not have a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with valproate or levetiracetam, and most people with epilepsy can start HRT without seizure worsening if it’s introduced gradually with monitoring.\n- Coordinate between your neurologist and the prescriber of HRT, set a monitoring plan, and protect sleep. That proactive approach is usually all that’s needed.\n\nIf you can share the specific HRT regimen you’re considering (estradiol route/dose; antiandrogen choice), I can tailor the interaction and monitoring advice more precisely.",

    "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you and your family are going through this. You’re doing the right thing by documenting what you see and pushing for answers. Below is a practical list of likely possibilities, what to ask the doctor, and steps you can take now to improve safety.\n\nWhat might explain the spells, shaking, and memory problems\n- Medication side effects or toxicities (high on my list)\n  - Valproate/Depakote can cause:\n    - Tremor, gait instability, confusion, slowed thinking.\n    - Reversible parkinsonism (shaking, stiffness, shuffling, falls) in older adults.\n    - Hyperammonemia (high blood ammonia) even when liver tests look okay. This can cause sudden confusion, sleepiness, memory problems, and “negative myoclonus/asterixis” (brief lapses in muscle tone) that lead to dropping things (cigarette, dishes). This fits your description of sudden jerks and dropping items.\n  - Gabapentin can cause:\n    - Drowsiness, dizziness, unsteady gait, memory and concentration problems—especially when combined with other brain-slowing meds.\n  - Together they can add up to worse confusion and falls, even if they don’t have a “dangerous interaction” on paper.\n  - Blood pressure medicines can contribute to dizziness/orthostatic drops and falls.\n\n- The “leg shaking while standing/leaving her leaning on things” pattern\n  - Orthostatic tremor or orthostatic myoclonus: fast shaking of the legs that occurs mainly when standing, improves with sitting or leaning. Often causes the feeling that the legs will give out. This is frequently missed and can be diagnosed by a neurologist (movement disorder specialist) with surface EMG. Treatments can include clonazepam, gabapentin, propranolol, or others—though meds must be balanced with side effects.\n  - Less likely epileptic seizures if awareness is preserved and it’s mostly the legs; capturing an event on video-EEG would help.\n\n- Epilepsy vs nonepileptic events\n  - It’s possible she has epilepsy, but some events may be something else (orthostatic tremor, medication effects, fainting from low blood pressure). Video of an event and, if possible, inpatient video-EEG monitoring can clarify.\n\n- Vascular cognitive impairment (“plaques” on brain imaging)\n  - In people with long-standing high blood pressure and heavy smoking, MRI often shows white matter disease (tiny vessel damage), which can cause memory and walking problems. This is different from Alzheimer’s and is common.\n  - Alzheimer’s or another neurodegenerative process is also possible, but medications and medical issues must be ruled out first.\n\n- Other contributors worth checking\n  - Low thyroid (TSH), low B12, low sodium, kidney/liver problems, diabetes, sleep apnea, depression/anxiety—all can worsen memory and balance.\n  - Urinary tract infections or other infections can trigger confusion in older adults.\n\nWhat to bring to the doctor and what to ask for\n- Bring:\n  - A complete medication list with exact doses and times (including over-the-counter and supplements).\n  - A symptom diary for 1–2 weeks: time of day, what happened, what she was doing, how long it lasted, awareness, triggers, and what meds she took before it.\n  - Phone videos of the leg-shaking/fall spells (get from the side if safe).\n  - A home blood pressure log (including seated and standing readings: measure sitting, then stand and recheck at 1 and 3 minutes).\n\n- Ask for:\n  - Medication review with a plan to simplify. Specifically ask whether Depakote could be causing tremor, gait problems, or confusion and whether a gradual switch to another anti-seizure medication with fewer cognitive effects in older adults (for example, lamotrigine or levetiracetam) is appropriate. Also ask whether gabapentin dose can be reduced or stopped to see if cognition and balance improve.\n  - Labs:\n    - Valproic acid (Depakote) level.\n    - Ammonia level (to check for valproate-induced hyperammonemia).\n    - Comprehensive metabolic panel, liver and kidney tests.\n    - CBC (platelets can drop with valproate).\n    - TSH, vitamin B12, folate, HbA1c, electrolytes (especially sodium).\n    - Urinalysis/culture if any urinary symptoms or sudden confusion.\n  - Brain MRI (if not done recently) to clarify “plaques” and look for small strokes or other changes.\n  - EEG, and if events are frequent, discuss video-EEG monitoring to confirm whether the spells are epileptic.\n  - Orthostatic vitals in clinic and a movement-disorder evaluation; consider surface EMG for orthostatic tremor/myoclonus.\n  - Cognitive screening (MoCA) and depression/anxiety screening.\n  - Review of blood pressure medications for orthostatic drops.\n\nPractical safety steps now\n- Fall prevention:\n  - Use a cane or walker; install grab bars; remove throw rugs/clutter; good lighting; sturdy shoes; consider physical therapy for balance training.\n  - Sit down to dress and when doing tasks that trigger leg shaking.\n- Fire and burn safety (critical with the cigarette drops):\n  - Absolutely no smoking in bed or when drowsy. Smoke only while seated in a hard chair at a table.\n  - Use a deep, heavy, water-filled ashtray; keep a metal bowl of water nearby to douse butts immediately.\n  - Wear snug, non-flammable clothing; keep oxygen (if any) far away from cigarettes.\n  - Install working smoke alarms in every bedroom and hallway; many local fire departments will install these for free.\n- Seizure precautions (until clarified):\n  - Don’t drive; shower instead of bath; avoid heights, open flames, and swimming alone.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or repeated without recovery.\n- New weakness or numbness on one side, slurred speech, severe headache (stroke signs).\n- Severe or rapidly worsening confusion or extreme sleepiness (especially if on Depakote—could be high ammonia).\n- Head injury from a fall, high fever, chest pain, shortness of breath.\n\nAbout the combination of Depakote and gabapentin\n- They are not absolutely contraindicated together, but in older adults they can strongly add to drowsiness, confusion, and gait instability. Depakote can also directly cause tremor and cognitive slowing, and in some people causes high ammonia levels that make thinking and balance much worse. The pattern you’re seeing is plausible and worth a careful, supervised medication change rather than being dismissed.\n\nAccess to care without insurance\n- Look for a Federally Qualified Health Center (sliding-scale), a county clinic, or a teaching hospital/neurology department with charity care. Ask for a social worker to help with applications (Medicaid, disability, hospital financial assistance).\n- Low-cost labs (some national labs offer direct-pay discounted panels).\n- If you can, prioritize: lab tests (including ammonia and valproate level), medication review, and a movement-disorder neurology visit.\n\nSupport for you\n- Caregiving is hard. Consider a counselor, caregiver support groups (local or online), and discuss with family how to share tasks so you can pursue your graduation and jobs. Your well-being matters too.\n- If anxiety feels overwhelming or you’re in crisis, call/text 988 in the U.S.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a one-page “doctor handout” summarizing her meds, symptoms, and the specific tests and questions to bring to the next appointment. I can also help you list nearby low-cost clinics if you share your city/ZIP.",

    "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
    "answer": "Short version: what you’re seeing is very plausible. Valproic acid (VPA) can blunt alertness, attention, processing speed, and language output in some children—even at doses considered “low.” When it’s stopped, many kids look more awake, engaged, and communicative. The occasional mood swings you’ve noticed can happen too, as you’re removing a medication that also acts as a mood stabilizer.\n\nWhy this can happen\n- Direct cognitive/behavioral effects of VPA: VPA enhances inhibitory (GABA) signaling and can slow processing speed and attention, increase fatigue, and dampen affect. Kids with neurodevelopmental disorders (PDD/ASD, ADHD) tend to be more sensitive to these effects.\n- “Not just dose-dependent”: Some children experience noticeable cognitive dulling at serum levels that look “modest.” Side effects don’t always track neatly with dose or blood level.\n- Language/communication: Slowed attention and processing can translate into less spontaneous speech, poorer receptive language, and reduced social engagement; removing the drag can uncover abilities that were there but harder to express.\n- Hyperammonemia (sometimes): VPA can raise ammonia, causing brain “fog,” irritability, and slowed thinking even with normal liver tests. It’s more likely in younger children or with carnitine deficiency. If it was present, stopping VPA would reverse it.\n- Carnitine depletion: VPA can lower carnitine in kids, contributing to fatigue and cognitive slowing. This also reverses off the drug.\n- Mood effects: Because VPA is a mood stabilizer, coming off it can bring some transient mood lability (sadness/crying spells) as the brain re-equilibrates. This often settles with time.\n\nWhy topiramate was worse\n- Topiramate is well known for cognitive side effects (word-finding difficulty, attention/processing-speed problems, dizziness/ataxia). Your experience fits that profile; VPA is generally “gentler” than topiramate but can still cause meaningful cognitive dulling in some children.\n\nOther factors to keep in mind\n- Seizure control vs. medication effect: Interictal epileptiform activity can affect cognition, but the improvement after stopping VPA argues the med was the bigger contributor here. Still, keep an eye out for subtle absence or myoclonic seizures (staring, brief unresponsiveness, sudden drops/jerks, morning clumsiness), which can masquerade as inattention.\n- Genetics/neurodevelopment: A 15q26.1 microdeletion, PDD/ASD, ADHD, and developmental delays make her more vulnerable to medication side effects on cognition and behavior.\n- Bedwetting/accidents: These are common with developmental delay and ADHD. They’re less likely to be directly from VPA, though daytime sedation can worsen awareness of bodily cues.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Celebrate the gains and keep tracking: Keep simple notes on attention, language, sleep, mood, and any events that could be seizures. Share with her neurologist.\n- Discuss with her neurologist:\n  - Whether an updated EEG is warranted now that she’s off medication, especially if there’s any concern for subtle seizures.\n  - The occasional mood swings—often transient; behavioral strategies usually suffice. If they become frequent or impairing, your team can consider targeted supports.\n  - If medication is ever needed again, options with a more favorable cognitive profile (for many kids, lamotrigine is “lighter” cognitively; ethosuximide for absence seizures; levetiracetam can be effective but sometimes irritability/mood issues).\n  - If VPA were ever reconsidered, strategies like checking ammonia, carnitine, thyroid, and CBC/LFTs, and supplementing L-carnitine when appropriate can help mitigate side effects.\n- School/therapies: Given the clear cognitive/communication upswing, it’s a good time to:\n  - Update neuropsychological testing to adjust IEP goals.\n  - Intensify speech-language therapy and occupational therapy (to leverage the new attention/engagement and work on fine/gross motor skills and toileting routines).\n  - Consider a structured bladder program with pediatric OT or urology if accidents persist.\n- Safety: You’ve met the common “2 years seizure-free” criterion to stop meds, but kids with neurodevelopmental disorders/genetic variants have a somewhat higher relapse risk. Maintain your seizure action plan and revisit it with school/caregivers.\n\nBottom line\nYour observation is consistent with known effects of valproic acid on alertness, attention, and processing speed in children—effects that can meaningfully dampen language and social engagement. Coming off VPA often reveals a “more present” child. The occasional mood swings likely reflect the loss of a mild mood-stabilizing effect and often improve over time. Keep close communication with her neurologist and therapy team to build on her current momentum and to watch for any return of seizures.",

    "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
    "answer": "Short version: your EEG showed “interictal epileptiform discharges” (spike-and-wave bursts) coming from the right side of your brain, mainly the frontal area, with spread toward the temporal and central (sensorimotor) regions. That pattern supports a tendency to have focal (partial) seizures from that area, even though you didn’t have a clinical seizure during the recording.\n\nWhat the terms mean:\n- Spike-and-wave discharges: brief abnormal bursts of electrical activity that are typical of epilepsy between seizures (interictal). They are not the same as an actual seizure on EEG.\n- Right frontotemporal and central regions: the signals were seen over the right frontal lobe and extended toward the right temporal lobe and the central/rolandic (sensorimotor) area.\n- Maximally frontal: the largest/clearest activity was over the right frontal electrodes, suggesting the main focus is likely in the right frontal lobe, with a field that spreads to nearby regions.\n\nHow to interpret this:\n- It’s common not to capture an actual seizure during an EEG. Interictal spikes are often what we rely on to support a diagnosis of epilepsy when the history fits.\n- In someone with episodes suggestive of focal seizures, this EEG increases confidence that the events are epileptic and likely arise from the right frontal region.\n- A small number of people without epilepsy can have rare spikes, but a clear focal spike-and-wave pattern plus your history is usually considered significant.\n\nWhat this might mean for care:\n- Your neurologist will correlate this with your description of events and any brain imaging (ideally an MRI with an epilepsy protocol) to look for a structural cause in that region.\n- It may support starting or continuing anti-seizure medication and guide choices if a change is needed.\n\nSafety/next steps:\n- Until you’ve discussed this with your neurologist, follow seizure precautions: avoid swimming alone or heights, be cautious with machinery, minimize sleep deprivation and alcohol. Driving rules vary by location—follow local regulations and your doctor’s advice.\n- Seek urgent care for a convulsive seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery, a significant head injury, or new focal weakness.\n\nIf you’d like, share what your typical episodes are like (symptoms, duration, triggers), current meds, and whether you’ve had an MRI—this can help frame what questions to ask your neurologist at your follow-up.",

    "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re dealing with this. You’re right to prioritize getting safe, affordable care and stabilizing your income. Here’s a practical, California-specific game plan you can start on now, plus answers to your questions.\n\nImmediate medical and safety steps\n- Do not drive. In California, seizures/lapses of consciousness must be reported and you must be seizure‑free for a period before the DMV reinstates driving.\n- Seizure safety: no heights, swimming alone, tubs/hot baths, open flames/hot surfaces, heavy machinery/ladders. Use showers, keep doors unlocked, avoid alcohol and sleep deprivation.\n- Do not stop Keppra suddenly. If side effects are intolerable, a clinician can switch meds or adjust dosing. Some clinicians add vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50–100 mg/day to reduce Keppra irritability, but only start supplements after speaking with a clinician.\n- Get seen at a low‑cost community clinic ASAP. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) can see you on a sliding scale, order/refill meds, and refer to neurology and cardiology:\n  - Family Health Centers of San Diego, San Ysidro Health, La Maestra, Neighborhood Healthcare, Vista Community Clinic. Ask for: primary care visit, neurology referral, and basic cardiac work‑up (ECG, Holter, echocardiogram if indicated).\n  - They also have certified enrollment counselors who can re-check Medi‑Cal and Covered California and screen you for financial aid.\n- If you must pay cash, ask about low cash‑price imaging centers for MRI/EEG and cardiology tests; clinics can direct you to the cheapest options.\n\nCoverage and cost options in California\n1) Medi‑Cal (California Medicaid)\n- Eligibility for adults is based on your current monthly income. The cutoff is roughly 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Your $630/week unemployment likely puts you over that right now, which is why you were denied.\n- Important: Medi‑Cal is year‑round. As soon as your unemployment ends or drops, reapply immediately (same month). If approved, ask about retroactive coverage for the month of application and up to 3 months before if you would have qualified in those months.\n- Where to apply/ask questions:\n  - Online: BenefitsCal.com\n  - San Diego County ACCESS line: 866-262-9881\n  - 211 San Diego can connect you to in‑person help: dial 2‑1‑1\n\n2) Covered California (Obamacare)\n- Subsidies are based on your projected annual income, and plan eligibility depends on whether you are eligible for Medi‑Cal this month.\n- If your current monthly income is too high for Medi‑Cal, you can generally get a subsidized Covered California plan now. If your projected annual income is around 150–200% FPL, you can often get a Silver plan with very low copays/deductibles at a low monthly premium.\n- Many people are quoted high premiums because the income estimate is off. Sit with a Covered California certified enroller (free, often at FQHCs) to:\n  - Enter your real projected annual income (unemployment for only 3–4 months may bring your annual income down a lot).\n  - Make sure you’re matched with an “Enhanced Silver” (CSR 87 or 94) plan if eligible—these have much lower deductibles/copays.\n  - In California, people with incomes at or below about 150% FPL can enroll year‑round in subsidized coverage—ask the counselor if you qualify for this special rule.\n\n3) County Medical Services (CMS) – San Diego County\n- San Diego still has a County Medical Services program for low‑income adult residents who don’t qualify for Medi‑Cal. It can cover necessary services at contracted clinics/hospitals.\n- Ask the county worker specifically: “Am I eligible for the County Medical Services (CMS) program while I’m over Medi‑Cal income?” They’ll screen you.\n\n4) Hospital financial assistance for your $5,000 ER bill (very important)\n- California law requires hospitals to provide charity care/discounts for patients up to at least 400% of FPL and to offer reasonable payment plans. They must screen you for financial assistance before collections.\n- Act now: call the hospital’s billing department and say, “I want to apply for Financial Assistance/Charity Care under California’s Hospital Fair Pricing law (AB 1020). Please send the application.” Provide proof of income (unemployment statements), household size, and any assets. Ask for full or partial charity write‑off and a zero‑interest payment plan for any remainder.\n- If you’re denied or need help, call:\n  - Health Consumer Alliance (free legal help statewide): 888-804-3536\n  - Legal Aid Society of San Diego, Health Consumer Center: they can help with Medi‑Cal, Covered California, and hospital bills.\n\nIncome support and disability options\n- State Disability Insurance (SDI) – California EDD:\n  - If you’re medically unable to do your regular job (and a server with frequent lapses/seizures is unsafe), apply for SDI now. You cannot collect Unemployment Insurance (UI) and SDI at the same time. If you switch to SDI, you should stop certifying for UI.\n  - SDI typically pays about 60–70% of recent wages and is much faster than federal disability programs.\n  - A U.S. licensed provider must certify your disability (an FQHC clinician can do this). Foreign medical records help but won’t replace a US provider certification.\n  - File online ASAP: edd.ca.gov/disability. If you’re past the standard filing window, still apply—explain why you filed late (medical issues).\n- Employer/Union disability: Ask your union or HR if there’s a separate short‑term disability benefit. If yes, they’ll tell you how to apply; it usually also requires a clinician’s certification.\n- Social Security Disability (SSDI) / SSI:\n  - SSDI requires work credits and often takes months to years. Medicare starts 24 months after SSDI approval (except ALS/ESRD). Epilepsy can qualify if seizures persist despite treatment and are well‑documented; you’ll need strong US medical records and doctor statements.\n  - SSI is needs‑based (very low income/assets) and provides Medi‑Cal if approved. You can apply at ssa.gov or your local SSA office, but consider talking to Legal Aid first for strategy.\n\nWhat to say to the county worker/enroller\n- “I need help picking the fastest path to coverage. Right now my monthly unemployment makes me ineligible for Medi‑Cal, but my annual income will likely be low. Please screen me for:\n  - Covered California with Enhanced Silver cost-sharing reductions based on my projected annual income.\n  - San Diego County Medical Services (CMS) as a bridge until Medi‑Cal.\n  - Medi‑Cal ABD/medically needy with share of cost, in case I qualify under disability rules.\n  - Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE), if there’s any way to use it now.\n  - Retroactive Medi‑Cal for months I qualify once my income drops.”\n- “I also need help with a hospital financial assistance application under AB 1020 for a $5,000 ER bill.”\n- Ask for an appointment with a certified enroller at an FQHC if the county can’t help immediately.\n\nNeurology/cardiology access tips\n- FQHCs can refer to neurology; ask if they work with Project Access San Diego (Champions for Health), which connects uninsured low‑income patients to volunteer specialists (including neurology and cardiology).\n- Epilepsy Foundation of San Diego County can help with education, support groups, and sometimes navigation/referrals: find them online or via 211 San Diego.\n- Keep a seizure diary (dates, times, duration, triggers, missed meds, sleep, alcohol/caffeine). This helps your clinician optimize treatment and supports disability claims.\n- Medication cost: generic levetiracetam is inexpensive at many pharmacies (use a coupon app if paying cash). If switching meds is appropriate, ask for generics with low cash prices.\n\nUsing records from Mexico\n- Bring all records. If they’re in Spanish, ask the clinic to scan them in and note key findings; translation helps but isn’t strictly required for clinicians to use. For disability programs, US documentation is much stronger; get US clinic notes and any US tests you can.\n\nIf symptoms worsen\n- If you have prolonged confusion, a new type of seizure, injury, head trauma, chest pain, or fainting with injury, go to the ER. You cannot be turned away for inability to pay, and you can pursue charity care afterwards.\n\nKey contacts and next steps checklist\n1) Make a same‑week appointment at a local FQHC (Family Health Centers SD, San Ysidro Health, La Maestra, etc.) for seizure management and SDI paperwork.\n2) Apply for State Disability Insurance online at edd.ca.gov/disability; stop certifying for UI when you submit SDI.\n3) Meet with a Covered California certified enroller (ask the FQHC to schedule) to re‑estimate annual income and check for Enhanced Silver plans, or CMS if applicable.\n4) Call the hospital billing office to request a Financial Assistance/Charity Care application (AB 1020). Ask for help from Health Consumer Alliance (888-804-3536) if needed.\n5) Call San Diego County ACCESS (866-262-9881) or 211 for help with Medi‑Cal/CMS and to understand options when UI ends.\n6) Contact Epilepsy Foundation of San Diego County for support and resources.\n\nYou’re doing the right things under really tough circumstances. If you want, tell me your ZIP code and I can list the nearest FQHC clinics and Covered California enrollment sites, plus the billing office contact for your ER hospital if you have its name.",

    "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’ve been going through this, and I’m glad you reached out. Given your recent crisis, please also make sure you have urgent supports in place (details below).\n\nShort answer to your question: yes—it’s very possible.\n- Some of the anti‑seizure medicines you were on are also used as mood stabilizers. In particular:\n  - Lamotrigine helps prevent bipolar depression and stabilize mood.\n  - Sodium valproate (Epilim) treats mania and helps with mood stabilization (though it’s generally avoided in people who could become pregnant due to serious risks and can worsen PCOS).\n  - Topiramate is sometimes used off‑label for mood and impulsivity but evidence is weaker.\n  - Levetiracetam (Keppra) can sometimes worsen irritability/anxiety in some people.\n- If you have an underlying bipolar‑spectrum or mood‑instability condition, being on lamotrigine/valproate/topiramate could have been keeping it partly controlled. Stopping them may have “unmasked” mood symptoms.\n- Also important: antidepressants like mirtazapine can sometimes trigger hypomania/mania or rapid cycling in people with bipolar disorder when used alone (without a mood stabilizer).\n\nWhat you describe—weeks of very low mood interspersed with periods of feeling more impulsive/reckless and rapid day‑to‑day shifts—raises the possibility of:\n- Bipolar spectrum disorder (particularly if there’s decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, spending sprees), sometimes with mixed features, or\n- Another form of mood/affect dysregulation (often seen with PNES), sometimes linked to trauma or stress.\nA careful psychiatric assessment is needed to sort this out.\n\nWhat to do next (please don’t change or stop any meds on your own):\n1) Seek an urgent medication review\n   - Contact your GP or mental health team urgently to discuss possible bipolar spectrum and the risk that mirtazapine monotherapy could be destabilizing your mood.\n   - Ask for an assessment for bipolar disorder and a plan that may include a mood stabilizer. Options to discuss:\n     - Lamotrigine (often helpful for depression‑predominant bipolar; generally weight‑neutral).\n     - Lithium (very effective for mood stabilization and suicide‑risk reduction; needs blood monitoring).\n     - Quetiapine or other second‑generation antipsychotics (effective, but can affect weight/metabolic health).\n     - Avoid/limit valproate given your age and PCOS unless there’s a compelling reason and you’re fully counseled under the pregnancy prevention program.\n   - If bipolar is suspected, continuing an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer is often avoided.\n\n2) Therapy\n   - PNES is commonly associated with stress/trauma and benefits from psychotherapy (CBT with a trauma‑informed approach; DBT can help with emotion regulation and impulsivity).\n   - Ask for a referral to psychological therapies familiar with PNES.\n\n3) Safety and monitoring\n   - Create a written safety plan (warning signs, coping steps, who to contact, removing or locking away means).\n   - Track a daily log of sleep, mood (1–10), impulses/spending, and triggers. Bring this to appointments.\n   - Ask your clinician to check for medical contributors: thyroid function, iron/ferritin, B12/folate, vitamin D, sleep quality, and hormonal factors (PCOS/endometriosis can influence mood, including PMDD).\n\n4) Practical stabilizers\n   - Keep sleep/wake times regular.\n   - Eat regularly, hydrate, and minimize caffeine/energy drinks.\n   - Lean on trusted supports; consider limits on spending during “up” periods (freeze cards, spending caps).\n\nIf you’re in the UK and need urgent help:\n- If you feel at immediate risk: call 999 or go to A&E.\n- 24/7 listening: Samaritans 116 123.\n- Text support: SHOUT to 85258.\n- NHS 111 for urgent advice.\n- Contact your local Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team (via your local NHS trust or GP).\n- Let a trusted person know how you’re feeling today.\n\nYou’re not alone in this, and there are effective treatments. Bringing the “were my anti‑seizure meds stabilizing my mood?” question directly to your GP/psychiatrist is a very reasonable next step, especially given the recent severe low mood and the pattern you’ve noticed.",

    "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",
    "answer": "I can’t diagnose you here, but based on what you’ve described, the pattern sounds most consistent with chronic migraine with aura complicated by probable medication‑overuse headache, with a few other treatable possibilities to consider. Below is a focused framework you can take to your neurologist/headache specialist.\n\nWhat your history suggests\n- Chronic migraine with aura:\n  - Headache on waking, daily or near‑daily for >3 months, unilateral throbbing, photophobia/phonophobia, nausea, and visual aura all fit.\n- Medication‑overuse headache (MOH) likely amplifying and perpetuating the pain:\n  - Daily ibuprofen and daily kratom (an opioid‑like agent) both can cause MOH. Criteria: regular use of NSAIDs ≥15 days/month or opioids (or opioid‑like) ≥10 days/month for >3 months in someone with a primary headache disorder.\n  - MOH produces a dull, daily or near‑daily headache that persists from morning to night and reduces responsiveness to acute and preventive treatments.\n- Other primary headaches to keep in mind:\n  - Hemicrania continua: continuous unilateral headache with exacerbations, often responsive dramatically to indomethacin. Typically strictly side‑locked and may have autonomic signs (tearing, nasal congestion).\n  - Cervicogenic/occipital neuralgia overlap: unilateral pain radiating from neck/occiput to the eye; can respond to occipital nerve blocks and PT.\n- Seizure‑related headache:\n  - Post‑ictal headaches are common, but your long continuous pattern is more typical of chronic migraine/MOH than of ictal or post‑ictal headache.\n\nImportant safety and interaction notes\n- Kratom:\n  - Acts at mu‑opioid receptors and has been linked to seizures, liver injury, QT prolongation, and significant drug interactions.\n  - Combining kratom with hydroxyzine, baclofen, and Librium increases sedation and respiratory depression risk.\n  - Regular use strongly predisposes to medication‑overuse headache.\n- Ibuprofen daily: increases MOH risk, GI/renal risks.\n- Propranolol with resting pulse 40–60 bpm: further dose increases for migraine prevention may not be safe; discuss with your doctor.\n- Do not abruptly stop baclofen or benzodiazepines (Librium) because of withdrawal/seizure risk.\n\nWhat to ask your doctors to do next\n1) Reassess for secondary causes and update imaging\n- If you haven’t had a recent MRI brain with and without contrast (and MRV/MRA if clinically indicated), ask for it, given the chronic unilateral nature and change from prior pattern.\n- Basic labs: CBC, CMP, TSH; consider ESR/CRP if any systemic symptoms.\n- Formal eye exam to check for papilledema if headaches are worse on waking or there’s any visual change beyond typical aura.\n\n2) Address likely medication‑overuse headache\n- Plan a supervised discontinuation of kratom and restrict NSAIDs:\n  - Opioid‑like agents should be tapered gradually to minimize withdrawal and seizure risk. A common approach is 10–20% dose reduction every 3–7 days, individualized by your clinician.\n  - Limit all acute headache meds to ≤2 days per week on average once the taper is completed.\n  - Your team may offer bridge therapy during withdrawal (e.g., a brief steroid taper, scheduled naproxen for a short window, antiemetics, IV magnesium in clinic/ED) to blunt rebound; this must be tailored to your seizure risk.\n- For cubital tunnel syndrome, discuss non‑NSAID strategies (splinting, PT, topical NSAIDs, neuropathic agents) to avoid relapsing into MOH.\n\n3) Start or optimize a migraine preventive that fits with epilepsy and your vitals\n- You’re already on propranolol and zonisamide; further beta‑blockade may be limited by bradycardia and BP.\n- Options to discuss:\n  - CGRP monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab): generally well‑tolerated, no known seizure‑worsening, minimal drug interactions.\n  - Oral CGRP antagonists for prevention: atogepant daily or rimegepant every other day. Check interactions with your current meds; generally compatible.\n  - OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) for chronic migraine (≥15 headache days/month).\n  - If considering traditional preventives: valproate can help both epilepsy and migraine but has side effects and interaction considerations; TCAs/SNRIs can help migraine but may lower seizure threshold—require careful risk/benefit discussion with your epileptologist.\n  - If headache is side‑locked and daily, request a short diagnostic indomethacin trial (with gastric protection). A dramatic response supports hemicrania continua and guides long‑term therapy.\n\n4) Improve acute/abortive options that avoid MOH\n- Since triptans didn’t help before, discuss:\n  - Gepants for acute treatment (ubrogepant, rimegepant) which do not cause MOH in the same way and are usually safe with epilepsy.\n  - Dihydroergotamine nasal (if cardiovascular status allows), or intranasal lidocaine as a non‑systemic option.\n  - Neuromodulation devices (Nerivio, Cefaly, gammaCore) as non‑drug options.\n- Keep ondansetron for nausea; metoclopramide or prochlorperazine can be alternatives but may have extra‑pyramidal risks.\n\n5) Consider procedures and neck‑focused care\n- Greater/lesser occipital nerve blocks can help chronic migraine and occipital neuralgia and may also be a useful bridge during MOH withdrawal.\n- Physical therapy targeting cervical posture and mobility; evaluate for cervicogenic contribution.\n\n6) Lifestyle and supplements (generally seizure‑safe)\n- Maintain consistent sleep and hydration; limit screen glare and use blue‑light filters when aura is active.\n- Magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg nightly, riboflavin (B2) 400 mg daily, and CoQ10 100–300 mg daily have supportive evidence and are safe with your meds.\n- Gentle aerobic activity as tolerated; avoid known personal triggers.\n- Keep a concise headache diary: laterality, aura, severity, duration, meds used, and any seizure correlation.\n\nRed flags that warrant urgent care\n- “Thunderclap” sudden worst headache of life.\n- New neurologic deficits, double vision, persistent aura >60 minutes different from your usual, confusion, fainting, high fever/neck stiffness.\n- Progressive worsening with vomiting, or headache triggered by coughing/straining that is new.\n- Any significant change from your typical aura or seizure pattern.\n\nBottom line to discuss with your neurologist\n- Your current pattern is very consistent with chronic migraine with aura, likely worsened by medication‑overuse headache from daily kratom and NSAID use. The most impactful next steps are:\n  - A supervised plan to taper/stop kratom and restrict NSAIDs/acute meds.\n  - Start a modern, well‑tolerated migraine preventive (CGRP mAb or gepant prevention, or Botox) compatible with epilepsy and your heart rate/BP.\n  - Consider an indomethacin trial if the headache is truly side‑locked, and consider nerve blocks/PT if there’s a cervical component.\n  - Update brain imaging if not recent.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a concise message to your neurologist summarizing the above and your goals for the next visit.",

    "question": "Weird version of sleep paralysis that feels like it’s in my head and somethings rattlingSo I get this weird sleep paralysis and sometimes it happens multiple times a night. But it’s like where I’m paralized but idt I can open my eyes. It feels like my brain is “tight”. like my brain feels like it’s rattling or something that could explode. Sometimes it feels like I’m in a hurricane. And sometimes I feel like I can control the feeling. Like if I ask myself a yes or no question. Bunch of times.. when an answers right the hurricane feeling will get much heavier. I have no clue how to explain it but this morning I felt like there was a “magnet” moving my had to my forehead. The thing is my hand couldn’t and didn’t actually move Bc I was laying on it but it was like in my imagination. It feels like my brain is zipped up. I sometimes think I can hear it. It happens when I’m waking up, falling asleep, or laying in bed It’s kinda like a whooshing feeling",
    "answer": "What you’re describing fits very well with recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, often with hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations (sensations as you’re falling asleep or waking). Many people also feel intense vibration, rumbling, “whooshing,” pressure/tightness in the head, a sense of being pulled or floated, or a “storm/hurricane” feeling. The “magnet moving your hand,” the rattling/zip sensation, and feeling like you can “ask questions” and the sensation changes are classic kinesthetic/vestibular hallucinations that can happen when dream imagery leaks into wakefulness while your body is still in REM paralysis. It feels real but is not dangerous.\n\nAnother benign phenomenon that can go with this is “exploding head syndrome” (the brain doesn’t literally explode): people hear a sudden bang, zap, or whoosh at sleep onset or awakening. It’s harmless but alarming.\n\nWhy it happens:\n- In REM sleep your brain keeps your body paralyzed (REM atonia). If you wake up before the paralysis turns off, you’re aware but can’t move or open your eyes normally.\n- Dream-like sensory effects (sound, motion, pressure, presence) can blend with wakefulness, causing the intense internal sensations you described.\n\nCommon triggers:\n- Sleep deprivation, irregular sleep schedule, jet lag, stress/anxiety, sleeping on your back.\n- Alcohol or cannabis (especially after heavy use or withdrawal), stimulants, some antidepressants (or stopping them) can change REM sleep and trigger episodes.\n- Obstructive sleep apnea and PTSD increase risk.\n- More frequent episodes (especially multiple times nightly) raise suspicion for narcolepsy, particularly if you also have daytime sleepiness or muscle weakness with emotions (cataplexy).\n\nWhat you can do now:\n- Keep a steady sleep schedule (aim 7–9 hours, same wake time daily).\n- Reduce sleep debt; manage stress; limit caffeine after noon and alcohol near bedtime.\n- Try side-sleeping instead of on your back; use pillows to keep position.\n- If an episode hits:\n  - Remind yourself it’s sleep paralysis and will pass in seconds to a couple minutes.\n  - Focus on slow breathing and moving one tiny muscle (wiggle a toe, finger, or tongue).\n  - Try a small cough or blink; sometimes that breaks the atonia.\n  - A bedside light or gentle sound on a timer can provide an orienting cue.\n  - If you share a bed, ask your partner to touch/speak to you if they notice you’re stuck.\n\nWhen to see a clinician (primary care or sleep medicine):\n- Episodes are frequent (e.g., weekly or multiple times per night), very distressing, or you’re excessively sleepy in the daytime.\n- You have any of the following: sudden muscle weakness triggered by emotions (knees buckling, jaw slack when laughing), falling asleep uncontrollably, loud snoring/gasping or witnessed apneas, new headaches or neurological symptoms, or the whooshing persists while fully awake and in sync with your heartbeat.\n- You recently started/stopped meds (especially antidepressants or stimulants) and symptoms changed.\n\nEvaluation may include a sleep diary, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, review of medications/substances, screening for sleep apnea, and sometimes an overnight sleep study with daytime nap testing if narcolepsy is suspected. For severe, persistent cases, doctors sometimes use REM-suppressing medications (certain antidepressants) or treat coexisting sleep disorders.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you think through possible triggers. A few quick questions:\n- How often is this happening now, and are you very sleepy during the day?\n- Do you ever get sudden weakness triggered by laughter or strong emotions?\n- Do you snore, wake up choking/gasping, or feel unrefreshed?\n- Any recent changes in sleep schedule, stress, alcohol/cannabis, or meds?",

    "question": "24F In less than a month, 5’4”, 114 lb, white. Marina, and occasional Tylenol. 9 months Postpartum, Arthritis, Depression, and Anxiety. No other drugs, or conditions. I’ve been having seizure like things for about 4 months, the Dr’s are confused by the full list of the symptoms, but believe they are seizures. It started with dizziness 6 months ago. So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG’s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I’m scared.. I’m a new mom, and some days I’m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can’t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don’t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I’m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn’t have any “episodes” yesterday, but couldn’t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I’m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr’s that they might not be considering as an option.",
    "answer": "You’re doing the right thing by going in for long‑term video EEG (vEEG). Two short EEGs being normal doesn’t rule out epilepsy—many people only show changes during a captured event. A 3–5 day admission is standard and often gives answers, whether the events are epileptic or not.\n\nWhat to expect during the vEEG admission\n- Set‑up: Electrodes are glued to your scalp and you’ll be on continuous video and heart‑rate monitoring. You’ll have a button to press at the first warning (stage 1).\n- Provoking events: They may use sleep deprivation, hyperventilation, flashing lights, or ask you to do things that tend to bring events on (safely). If you’re on antiseizure meds, they might adjust them—if not, you’ll likely just be observed.\n- Safety: Bed/chair alarms, assisted bathroom trips, fall precautions. You won’t be able to shower. Nurses/techs will come quickly when you press the button.\n- Other in‑hospital tests they might add: basic labs (electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose), EKG/telemetry, brain MRI with an epilepsy protocol (if not done), orthostatic vitals. Some centers can place a cardiac/event monitor.\n- Length: Plan for the full 5 days; they discharge earlier if they get a clear answer.\n\nIf epilepsy is confirmed\n- They’ll classify the seizure type and choose a medicine. Many antiseizure meds are compatible with breastfeeding; tell them you’re postpartum so they choose with mood and lactation in mind.\n- You’ll get safety counseling (driving, heights, water, baby care).\n\nIf epilepsy is not found (normal EEG during your typical events)\nCommon next steps target other conditions that can mimic seizures. None of these mean “it’s all in your head”—they’re real and treatable:\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)/functional seizures:\n  - Episodes often have preserved awareness, eyelid flutter, variable duration, frequent clusters, and are triggered by stress; vEEG shows no epileptic activity during events.\n  - Best treatment is psychotherapy (CBT or trauma‑informed therapy), plus targeted physiotherapy for functional symptoms, and active treatment of anxiety/depression. Antiseizure meds don’t help PNES.\n- Syncope or dysautonomia (including POTS):\n  - Can cause collapse, eye flutter, brief unresponsiveness, and post‑event fatigue. Triggers: standing, heat, dehydration, pain, stress.\n  - Tests: orthostatic vitals, tilt‑table test, EKG, Holter/patch monitor, echocardiogram if needed, fluids/salt strategies, and medications if POTS is confirmed.\n- Cataplexy (part of narcolepsy):\n  - Sudden loss of muscle tone with preserved awareness, often triggered by strong emotions (laughter, excitement, surprise). Episodes last seconds to a minute; people can slump or collapse and can’t speak or move.\n  - If suspected: referral to a sleep specialist for overnight sleep study + daytime MSLT.\n- Migraine variants (e.g., hemiplegic migraine):\n  - Transient weakness, speech problems; usually linked with migraine features and last longer than a minute.\n- Metabolic/other medical:\n  - Blood sugar abnormalities (especially while breastfeeding), anemia/iron deficiency, thyroid disease, electrolyte disturbances (Ca/Mg/Na), B12 deficiency. These are checked with blood tests.\n- Less common: periodic paralysis (episodes last hours, potassium-linked), movement disorders.\n\nThings to do now and to ask your team\n- Bring up:\n  - Triggers you’ve noticed (standing, heat, emotions, sleep loss, pain, dehydration).\n  - Whether events truly arise from sleep (has anyone seen one start while you’re asleep?).\n  - Any palpitations, chest pain, fainting history, tongue biting, injuries, or incontinence.\n  - The very high frequency and clustering.\n  - Postpartum status, breastfeeding/sleep deprivation, Mirena IUD, mood symptoms.\n  - Request: iron studies, B12, TSH, electrolytes, glucose; consider cardiac monitor and, if epilepsy is excluded, referral for PNES‑informed therapy and/or a sleep evaluation for cataplexy.\n- Keep a simple log while admitted: time, what you were doing, warning symptoms, duration, and recovery.\n\nSafety with your baby until you have a diagnosis\n- Don’t bathe the baby alone; use shallow water or have another adult present.\n- Feed and change the baby seated on the floor or a low couch.\n- Avoid carrying the baby on stairs; use stroller/crib on wheels if possible.\n- No co‑sleeping; use a bassinet/crib.\n- Cook with back burners only; avoid hot liquids while holding the baby.\n- Don’t drive until your clinicians clear you.\n- Prioritize sleep, hydration, regular meals; ask for help to get predictable rest.\n\nPreparing for the stay and passing the time\n- Practical: clean, dry hair; no hair products; button‑down/loose tops; comfortable pants; slippers with grip; long phone charger; headphones/earplugs; snacks; a water bottle; toiletries; pump supplies if pumping (ask about fridge/storage and power outlets).\n- Activities: audiobooks/podcasts, streaming, journaling, simple crafts that can be done seated, puzzles, guided breathing/relaxation apps, video calls with family.\n- Emotional: ask to meet the unit social worker; they can help with childcare logistics and leave paperwork. Let staff know you’re anxious—they can walk you through each step.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- Any event lasting >5 minutes or repeated events without recovery, a serious injury, head trauma, new severe headache with fever/stiff neck, chest pain, or new focal weakness that doesn’t resolve—call emergency services.\n\nTwo quick questions that could help your team:\n- Do your collapses ever follow laughter, surprise, or strong emotions?\n- Have you ever had tongue biting on the side of the tongue, loss of bladder control, or significant injuries during an event?\n\nYou’re not alone—these evaluations are stressful, but they’re exactly how we get clarity and a plan. If you’d like, I can help you make a short checklist to bring to the hospital.",

    "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 ¬— at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",
    "answer": "You’ve carried a lot for a long time. The symptoms you describe—fatigue, poor concentration, anxiety/depression, and memory problems—can come from several places, and they often reinforce each other. Here’s a practical way to sort this out and move toward what’s most likely to help, with cost in mind.\n\nWhat might be lingering from childhood epilepsy versus PTSD\n- Early left temporal lobe epilepsy can leave stable, lifelong cognitive patterns, most commonly:\n  - Verbal memory issues (remembering names, lists, conversations), word-finding, and sometimes slower processing speed.\n  - These tend to be fairly consistent over time (not dramatically better/worse day to day).\n- PTSD/depression/anxiety commonly cause:\n  - Marked fatigue, variable concentration/“brain fog,” poor sleep, intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal, and memory lapses that fluctuate with stress and sleep.\n  - When PTSD/sleep/mood improve, attention and memory often improve, too.\n- Mild TBI at 14 with brief loss of consciousness typically doesn’t cause progressive problems years later; persistent cognitive effects from a single mild concussion are uncommon, especially if you functioned okay afterward.\n\nHow “in the clear” you may be regarding epilepsy now\n- A normal recent EEG plus many years without seizures are good signs; they both predict a low risk of recurrence.\n- The risk is not zero. It’s higher if there’s a structural brain scar (e.g., mesial temporal sclerosis), sleep deprivation, heavy alcohol use, certain drugs, or febrile illnesses.\n- Therapeutic doses of stimulants (like Adderall) are generally safe in people with well-controlled epilepsy, but they can worsen anxiety/sleep, which can indirectly raise seizure risk. Review this with your prescriber.\n\nWho to see first (cost-conscious, stepwise)\n1) Primary care visit (often lowest cost)\n   - Screen and treat reversible contributors: sleep issues, iron deficiency, thyroid issues, B12/folate, vitamin D, anemia, infections, medication side effects.\n   - Simple questionnaires (PHQ‑9, GAD‑7, PCL‑5, sleep screening) help quantify mood/PTSD burden and guide referrals.\n\n2) Neurologist—ideally an epileptologist—for a one-time consult\n   - Goal: confirm your current seizure risk is low, review your EEG, and see whether any further testing is worthwhile.\n   - If you haven’t had a brain MRI since childhood, ask whether a one-time MRI with an epilepsy protocol is indicated. If it’s normal and your EEG is normal, that further lowers concern.\n   - They can also advise on the safety of Adderall in your situation and seizure-precaution basics.\n\n3) Trauma-focused mental health care (psychiatrist and/or trauma therapist)\n   - Optimize first-line PTSD treatments: evidence-based therapies (CPT, PE, EMDR) and medications (SSRIs/SNRIs; prazosin for nightmares). Good sleep is foundational.\n   - If anxiety/hyperarousal are high, stimulants can sometimes worsen them—discuss alternatives or dose timing with your prescriber. If considering non-stimulants, avoid bupropion given seizure history; atomoxetine, guanfacine, or clonidine are options to discuss.\n\n4) Neuropsychological evaluation\n   - Best tool to separate PTSD/attention/mood effects from any residual left temporal lobe weaknesses and to get practical strategies.\n   - Produces an objective profile, treatment recommendations, and documentation for accommodations if needed.\n   - If cost is a barrier, ask about abbreviated batteries or clinic-based cognitive screening first.\n\nWhere Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) fits\n- Evidence: a few randomized trials (including in active-duty military) show modest short‑term improvement in PTSD symptoms for some patients; effects often last weeks to a few months and may require repeat blocks. It’s not a cure and works best alongside ongoing trauma therapy.\n- Risks are generally low with ultrasound guidance but include temporary Horner’s syndrome (droopy eyelid, small pupil), bleeding, infection, hoarseness, very rare pneumothorax, and rare local‑anesthetic toxicity (which can cause seizures if injected intravascularly—tell the team your history).\n- Cost/coverage vary widely. If you consider SGB:\n  - Choose a center with specific experience treating PTSD (often pain medicine or anesthesia).\n  - Ask: expected benefit and duration, number of blocks typically needed, their outcomes data, total cost, complication rate, ultrasound vs fluoroscopy guidance, and how they coordinate with your therapist.\n- Consider SGB after you’ve optimized first‑line PTSD care or if you need a symptom “window” to better engage in therapy.\n\nPutting it together\n- Your normal EEG and long seizure‑free interval argue that active epilepsy is unlikely to be the main driver of your current daily symptoms.\n- PTSD, sleep disturbance, and mood symptoms likely account for a large share of the fatigue, concentration issues, and memory lapses. Residual verbal memory/word‑finding weaknesses from early left temporal lobe epilepsy may coexist but are usually stable and can be worked around with strategies.\n- A one‑time neurology visit can help you feel confident about seizure risk and medication safety. Then focus resources on trauma-focused care and sleep. Add neuropsych testing if you need clarity on cognitive strengths/weaknesses and concrete strategies.\n\nPractical self‑help steps now\n- Prioritize sleep: consistent schedule, limit late caffeine, consider CBT‑I if insomnia; discuss prazosin if nightmares.\n- Exercise most days (even brief walks) to improve sleep, mood, and cognition.\n- Use memory strategies: external aids (notes/phone reminders), chunking, spaced repetition, and minimize multitasking.\n- Avoid heavy alcohol and stay hydrated; keep regular meals to avoid energy dips.\n\nRed flags that warrant prompt medical attention\n- Any new events concerning for seizures (staring spells with unresponsiveness, loss of awareness, tongue biting, waking confused, sudden injuries).\n- New severe or worsening headaches, new neurological deficits, or major changes in consciousness.\n\nIf you can find one, a behavioral neurologist or neuropsychiatrist is an excellent “one‑stop” specialist who straddles neurology and psychiatry and can help triage what’s driving what.\n\nIf you want, tell me your region/insurance constraints and I can help you prioritize or locate appropriate clinics.",

    "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question.My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures.My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic EpilepsyDrugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 1000mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed.Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety.",
    "answer": "Short answer: Your current anti-seizure medicines (valproate/Depakote and levetiracetam/Keppra) do not have any well-established, clinically significant drug–drug interactions with standard feminizing HRT (17‑β estradiol, plus an antiandrogen such as spironolactone or a GnRH agonist). Most people on these antiseizure meds can start HRT without seizure worsening, provided sleep and stress are well managed and meds are taken consistently.\n\nDetails and practical tips:\n- Estrogen and seizure control\n  - Estrogen can lower seizure threshold in some people, while progesterone can be neutral or protective. In practice, with stable anti-seizure regimens like yours, most patients do fine.\n  - The big interaction people hear about is estrogen speeding up lamotrigine (Lamictal) clearance, lowering its level; you are not on lamotrigine.\n\n- Your specific meds\n  - Valproate (Depakote): Not an enzyme inducer. No consistent evidence that estradiol HRT reduces valproate levels or vice versa. Rarely, any major hormonal change can alter seizure patterns, so monitor clinically.\n  - Levetiracetam (Keppra): Minimal metabolism, renal clearance. No known interaction with estradiol, progesterone, or spironolactone. Does not reduce hormone levels.\n  - Adderall: Therapeutic doses are generally safe in epilepsy; avoid sleep loss and overuse, as sleep deprivation is a JME trigger.\n  - Melatonin and your supplements: Generally fine with HRT and ASMs.\n\n- Antiandrogens and progestogens\n  - Spironolactone: No known interaction with your ASMs; monitor potassium and blood pressure per routine.\n  - GnRH agonists: No ASM interaction.\n  - Cyproterone acetate (not commonly used in the U.S.): More hepatic/thrombotic risk; if used, coordinate closely with your clinicians.\n  - Micronized progesterone: Typically neutral for interactions; may aid sleep and could be seizure-neutral or even helpful for some.\n\n- Route of estrogen\n  - Prefer 17‑β estradiol (avoid ethinyl estradiol).\n  - Transdermal estradiol (patch/gel) gives steadier levels and lower clot risk than oral; many neurologists and endocrinologists favor it for people with epilepsy.\n\n- What to watch and how to start safely\n  - Keep a simple seizure diary starting 4 weeks before HRT and for 2–3 months after each dose change.\n  - Try not to change multiple neuroactive meds at once; if possible, avoid ASM dose changes right when you start HRT.\n  - Maintain strict sleep hygiene; JME is sensitive to sleep loss.\n  - Anxiety is a known trigger for you—have a plan (therapy, coping strategies) as you start HRT.\n  - Labs to consider before starting HRT and 6–8 weeks after dose changes: valproate level (if you and your neurologist monitor levels), CMP/LFTs, CBC/platelets; plus HRT labs (estradiol, testosterone, potassium if on spironolactone, lipids as indicated).\n\n- Other safety points\n  - If your Keppra is not the XR formulation, once‑daily dosing may give variable levels; confirm with your prescriber that you’re on Keppra XR for once‑daily use.\n  - VTE risk: transdermal estradiol helps minimize this. Avoid smoking, manage weight, and stay active—especially important since valproate can promote weight gain.\n  - Contraception: HRT is not birth control. If pregnancy is possible with a partner, use reliable contraception—valproate is highly teratogenic.\n\nWhen to call your clinicians\n- Any increase in seizure frequency, new seizure types, or notable side effects after starting or changing HRT.\n- If you need to adjust your ASM doses, do so only with your neurologist.\n\nBottom line: With your regimen (valproate + levetiracetam), feminizing HRT is generally compatible and not expected to cause pharmacokinetic problems. Choose estradiol (ideally transdermal), coordinate between your endocrinologist and neurologist, monitor sleep and stress, and track seizures during the first couple of months.",

    "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a “warning” which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn’t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I’ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I’ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It’s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more “medium range” events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don’t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I’ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I’ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren’t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I’ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I’m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’re going through this—what you describe is scary, frustrating, and it deserves a clear plan. The details you’ve shared point to something more than simple vasovagal syncope, and your instincts are valid.\n\nWhy epilepsy (especially temporal lobe) should be on the table\n- Stereotyped “warning” with intense déjà vu/surreal feeling is classic for temporal lobe seizure aura.\n- Events during sleep and while lying flat are less typical for vasovagal syncope, but common with seizures.\n- Post-event fogginess and short-term memory issues that persist for hours, plus progressive “medium-range” memory problems, fit with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).\n- Clustering in the week before menses suggests a hormonal pattern (catamenial epilepsy).\n- Your loop recorder showing sinus pauses (5–13 seconds) could be ictal bradycardia/asystole—an uncommon but well-described seizure-related phenomenon, most often from temporal lobe seizures.\n\nImportant nuance about a pacemaker\n- A pacemaker can prevent the prolonged pauses and reduce fainting/injuries, which is important for safety.\n- It does not treat seizures or the memory/cognitive effects. If the pauses are seizure-driven, the primary treatment is antiseizure therapy; a pacemaker can be added if pauses are long (often ≥6 seconds) or you’re getting injured.\n- If your pauses are due to reflex (vasovagal) syncope, a pacemaker can also help when pauses are this long and recurrent. Given your 13-second pauses, it’s reasonable that cardiology is discussing this.\n\nWhat to ask for now (to avoid waiting 2 months without momentum)\n- Request urgent/expedited evaluation at an epilepsy center (ask for a cancellation list). Frame it as “possible temporal lobe epilepsy with ictal asystole.”\n- Inpatient video-EEG monitoring with simultaneous ECG, ideally capturing one of your typical episodes. This is the gold standard to show whether a seizure starts before the heart pause.\n- Epilepsy-protocol brain MRI (3T, with dedicated temporal lobe sequences). Bring prior imaging if any.\n- Consider ambulatory EEG while you continue wearing the loop recorder if admission wait is long.\n- Neuropsychological testing to document memory issues and help localize/lateralize if seizures are confirmed.\n- Ask your cardiologist and neurologist to coordinate—share your loop recorder tracings and the timing of symptoms.\n\nInterim safety and practical steps\n- Don’t drive or operate dangerous machinery until this is clarified and controlled (laws vary; many require a seizure/syncope-free interval).\n- If you feel the warning: lie down flat immediately, elevate legs, and loosen tight clothing. If alone, use your phone/watch SOS to alert someone.\n- Avoid heights, swimming alone, hot baths (showers are safer), cooking over open flames when alone.\n- Keep a detailed diary: date/time, warning symptoms, position (standing/sitting/sleeping), duration, injuries, recovery time, relation to your menstrual cycle, sleep, illness, alcohol, and stress.\n- Bring a witness (if possible) to your appointment; ask anyone who sees an event to note features (staring, lip-smacking/hand automatisms, head/eye turning, speech arrest, cyanosis, jerking, tongue bite—especially on the side).\n- Review meds with your doctors: avoid drugs that slow the heart (e.g., beta-blockers) or markedly prolong QT unless necessary.\n\nCatamenial (hormone-related) angle\n- Track events vs your cycle. If epilepsy is confirmed and events cluster perimenstrually, options some neurologists use include perimenstrual adjustments (e.g., short courses of clobazam or acetazolamide) or progesterone-focused strategies. These should be guided by a neurologist/gynecologist after diagnosis.\n\nWhat to discuss with your doctors\n- “My spells have a stereotyped déjà vu aura and occur even during sleep. Can we evaluate for temporal lobe epilepsy with possible ictal asystole?”\n- “Can we arrange video-EEG with ECG and an epilepsy-protocol MRI?”\n- “Given pauses up to 13 seconds, would a pacemaker improve safety while we clarify the cause? I understand it won’t treat seizures if that’s the driver.”\n- “If seizures are confirmed, what antiseizure medication would you consider first-line for temporal lobe epilepsy, and how might we address the perimenstrual pattern?”\n\nIf you worsen while waiting\n- If spells become more frequent, you have injuries, or the warning time shortens, go to the ER and tell them “possible temporal lobe seizures with ictal asystole” and show your loop recorder history. They may be able to admit you for urgent video-EEG.\n\nBottom line\n- Your history strongly warrants an epilepsy-focused workup for temporal lobe seizures with ictal bradycardia/asystole. A pacemaker may still be appropriate for safety (given the documented long pauses), but it won’t address the root cause if this is seizure-related. Coordinated cardiology–neurology care and timely video-EEG are key.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a brief message to your doctors to expedite the right tests, or help you prepare a one-page summary to bring to your appointments.",

    "question": " Female, 20, 5\"7\", 250lbs, CaucasianNo drug use, no current medication,For the past 6 years I've been having what I think is sleep paralysis fits, the symptoms are like this:I have a weird feeling before sleeping, I can't describe it but when i feel it i know i'm gonna fall into sleep paralysis. then I can't move anything, i'm aware of of my surroundings, scary ominous aura, and sometimes theres this loud ringing, like so loud I feel it in my head pulsing, then pain in my body like fingers being pushed in my sides, and even i sometimes feel my body...buzzing? or shaking fast i dont know if its happening IRL or just in my sleep, or a part of my brain feels like electricity, its usually painful, but there was one time it felt...kinda not bad...like a brain massage, then it went down my back. I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",
    "answer": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you describe matches recurrent sleep paralysis very closely, including the “ominous aura,” awareness but inability to move, loud noises, buzzing/vibrations, pressure or pain, and the “floating/out‑of‑body” sensation. Those last features are called vestibular‑motor hallucinations and are common in sleep paralysis. The loud sounds can be part of sleep paralysis or a related benign phenomenon called “exploding head syndrome.” Sleep deprivation is a strong trigger, which fits your pattern.\n\nIs this a seizure? Based on what you wrote, seizures are less likely:\n- Sleep paralysis happens as you’re falling asleep or waking, with full awareness and an inability to move. People often remember the episode clearly.\n- Seizures typically involve loss of awareness (you don’t respond), no memory of the event, or waking confused; sometimes there’s tongue‑biting (especially on the sides), urinary incontinence, injuries, or rhythmic jerking witnessed by others. Post‑seizure confusion usually lasts minutes to hours.\n- Your “out‑of‑body/spiraling,” buzzing, and pressure sensations are classic for sleep paralysis; they’re not typical seizure features.\n\nThat said, if any of the red flags below appear, you should seek urgent care:\n- Episodes not tied to falling asleep or waking, or happening during the day with loss of awareness.\n- You don’t recall the episode; witnesses see stiffening or rhythmic jerking.\n- Lateral tongue biting, urinary incontinence, injuries, or you’re confused for a long time after.\n- New severe headache, fever with stiff neck, weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, or a recent head injury.\n- If you ever lose awareness unexpectedly, do not drive until evaluated.\n\nPossible contributors to your episodes:\n- Irregular sleep and sleep deprivation (major trigger).\n- Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): your BMI puts you at risk, and fragmented sleep from OSA can worsen sleep paralysis. Signs include loud snoring, gasping/choking at night, witnessed pauses in breathing, morning headaches, dry mouth, and daytime sleepiness.\n- Narcolepsy is less likely but worth considering if you have profound daytime sleepiness and/or sudden muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions (cataplexy).\n\nWhat you can do now (low‑cost, at home):\n1) Reduce triggers\n- Keep a strict sleep schedule (same bed/wake time every day).\n- Aim for 7.5–9 hours of sleep nightly. Avoid staying up several hours past your usual time.\n- Limit caffeine after noon; avoid alcohol and sedatives near bedtime.\n- Manage stress (brief wind‑down, journaling, breathing exercises, or a short guided meditation).\n\n2) Positional and bedroom strategies\n- Keep sleeping on your side (good for both sleep paralysis and suspected OSA). If you roll onto your back, use pillows or a backpack/tennis-ball trick to stay on your side.\n- Elevate the head of the bed slightly if it helps your breathing.\n- Dark, cool, quiet room; consistent pre‑sleep routine; avoid screens 60 minutes before bed or use blue‑light filters.\n\n3) During an episode\n- Remind yourself: this is a REM‑sleep glitch; it’s temporary and will pass.\n- Focus on small movements: try wiggling a single finger or toe, or moving just your tongue or eyebrows. These can “break” the paralysis.\n- Control breathing: slow, steady breaths; count them.\n- Try to move your eyes left-right (eye movements are often preserved during REM).\n- If episodes are frequent, consider a soft night light or relaxing background sound to reduce fear.\n\n4) After an episode/daytime recovery\n- Gentle stretching, hydration, and exposure to morning daylight can help clear the “fog.”\n- If sore, a warm shower and light activity can reduce muscle tension.\n\n5) Consider simple over‑the‑counter options\n- If nasal congestion or allergies affect sleep, a saline rinse or an OTC nasal steroid (like fluticasone) can improve airflow.\n- Melatonin (0.5–1 mg about 4–6 hours before desired bedtime or 1–3 mg 1–2 hours before bed) may help regulate timing; avoid high doses that can cause grogginess.\n\nWhen to pursue evaluation (telehealth/community clinic if possible)\n- If you snore loudly, gasp, or stop breathing at night, or you’re very sleepy in the day, ask about a home sleep apnea test (many programs can mail one; often lower cost).\n- If daytime sleepiness is severe or you have episodes of sudden weakness with emotions, ask about narcolepsy testing (overnight sleep study + daytime nap test).\n- If any seizure red flags appear, you need medical evaluation (could include EEG). Until clarified, avoid driving if there’s any risk of impaired awareness.\n\nAccess ideas if cost or COVID exposure is a barrier\n- Many communities have sliding‑scale clinics or telemedicine visits.\n- Some sleep centers offer home sleep apnea tests without an in‑person visit.\n- If you’re at a university or near one, student health or teaching hospitals often have lower‑cost options.\n\nA few questions that can help narrow things down if you’re able to reply:\n- Do you (or others) notice loud snoring, gasping, or pauses in breathing during sleep? Morning headaches or very dry mouth?\n- Do you have excessive daytime sleepiness when you’re not sleep‑deprived?\n- Do you ever get sudden muscle weakness with laughter or strong emotions?\n- About how long do the paralysis episodes last, and are they always at sleep onset or awakening?\n- Has anyone ever witnessed an episode, and if so, what did they see?\n\nBottom line: What you’ve described fits recurrent sleep paralysis with classic vestibular‑motor and auditory phenomena, strongly triggered by sleep deprivation. It’s frightening but not dangerous. Seizures sound unlikely from your description, but keep an eye on the red flags. Prioritizing regular sleep, side sleeping, and addressing possible sleep apnea can meaningfully reduce episodes. If you can, a telehealth visit to screen for OSA and discuss options would be a good next step.",

    "question": "Male 18 75kg 6ft black I started having these episodes last December. So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",
    "answer": "What you’re describing sounds very concerning for focal (partial) seizures coming from the temporal lobe, sometimes called “auras” or “focal aware seizures,” and possibly some episodes with impaired awareness and memory. The brief déjà vu with a “wave,” dizziness, head discomfort, a vivid but fleeting memory, and then amnesia for the memory are classic for temporal lobe seizures. The episode where you didn’t recognize your coworker and felt dazed, plus the crash with memory gaps, could be larger seizures or post‑ictal (after-seizure) confusion. Concussion from the crash can also worsen memory temporarily, but it wouldn’t explain the months of déjà vu episodes before.\n\nThis needs urgent in‑person medical evaluation.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Do not drive, swim alone, bathe in a tub, climb heights, use power tools, or operate machinery until a doctor clears you. Driving after episodes like this is unsafe and often illegal.\n- Seek urgent medical care today (emergency department or urgent care) given the recent crash, ongoing memory loss, and recurring episodes.\n- If you develop another episode with prolonged confusion, a severe/worst headache, repeated vomiting, fever/stiff neck, new weakness, trouble speaking, or you pass out, call emergency services.\n\nWhat to tell the doctor\n- Age 18, episodes since December: 5–10 seconds of déjà vu, dizziness, head discomfort, a specific recurring memory that vanishes afterward.\n- Two bigger events: one in May with confusion and not recognizing someone; another just before a car crash, with dazed feeling and memory gaps for the surrounding period.\n- No regular meds; occasional alcohol and social smoking; no known injuries except the recent crash.\n- Any family history of seizures? Any past head injuries, high fevers as a child with seizures, sleep deprivation, or alcohol binges before episodes?\n\nWhat evaluation you should expect\n- Neurologic exam and basic labs (glucose, electrolytes, CBC).\n- Brain imaging: MRI with an epilepsy protocol (preferred) or CT if urgent/after head trauma.\n- EEG (ideally within 24–48 hours; sometimes sleep‑deprived or ambulatory EEG increases yield).\n- Depending on details, possibly an EKG/Holter to rule out cardiac causes of blackouts.\n- If concussion is suspected from the crash, concussion assessment and guidance.\n\nSafety and lifestyle until seen\n- Stop driving. Laws vary by country/state, but typically you must be seizure‑free for months before resuming; your doctor can advise once a diagnosis is made. Which country are you in?\n- Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs; both can lower seizure threshold and worsen memory.\n- Prioritize sleep, hydration, regular meals; sleep deprivation can trigger seizures.\n- Ask someone who has seen an episode to write down what they saw or record (safely) if it happens again.\n- Keep a diary: date/time, what you were doing, triggers, how long it lasted, how you felt before/after.\n\nReassurance\n- If this is epilepsy, it’s common and usually very treatable with medication. Getting diagnosed and treated greatly reduces the risk of accidents and memory problems.\n- A brain tumor is a much less common cause in someone your age, but an MRI is the right step to check.\n\nIf you want, tell me your country so I can give you specific driving rules and help you draft a short summary to bring to the ER or your GP.",

    "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
    "answer": "What you describe sounds very typical of neurally mediated (vasovagal) syncope and/or orthostatic intolerance rather than epilepsy, diabetes, or a dangerous heart rhythm. The prodrome of sudden warmth, clamminess, dizziness, loud ringing in the ears, followed by a brief loss of consciousness and feeling washed out afterward is classic. The fact that your non‑flight faints were often with heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating also fits.\n\nWhy airplanes make it worse\n- Cabin conditions: lower cabin pressure (equivalent to 6–8,000 ft), dry air, and warm cabins → relative dehydration and lower oxygen content, which can tip you into a vasovagal episode.\n- Prolonged sitting → blood pools in legs/abdomen; getting up after sleeping can worsen this.\n- Big meals, alcohol, sedating antihistamines, or anxiety/hyperventilation can lower blood pressure or CO2 and trigger episodes.\n\nThings to review with your doctor (ideally before this trip)\n- Orthostatic vitals in clinic and consider a tilt-table test to clarify vasovagal syncope vs. POTS. POTS is common in young women and can overlap.\n- CBC and ferritin (iron deficiency can worsen presyncope), electrolytes, B12, and a recent thyroid panel to ensure you’re not over- or under‑replaced on levothyroxine.\n- If episodes are frequent/severe despite lifestyle measures, discuss a short trial of:\n  - Midodrine (raises vascular tone) or\n  - Fludrocortisone (expands plasma volume)\n  These are evidence-based options for recurrent vasovagal syncope/orthostatic intolerance, used with monitoring.\n- If periods are a trigger, optimize dysmenorrhea management (NSAIDs started 1–2 days before menses can reduce vagal symptoms).\n\nNon‑drug prevention plan for flights\nBefore the flight\n- Hydration and salt loading the day prior and morning of travel. Target an extra 1–2 liters of fluids spread out over the day plus salty foods/electrolyte solution if your blood pressure and kidneys are normal.\n- Avoid alcohol for 24–48 hours and sedating meds (e.g., diphenhydramine).\n- Wear waist‑high 20–30 mmHg compression (or thigh‑high plus an abdominal binder). Knee‑high socks alone are less effective for pooling.\n- Choose an aisle seat, ideally nearer the galley, keep the overhead air vent on you, and dress in layers you can remove quickly.\n- Let the crew know you’re prone to fainting; ask to preboard and to be checked on after sleep.\n\nDuring the flight\n- Drink 200–300 mL (7–10 oz) of fluids per hour. Use an oral rehydration/electrolyte drink rather than plain water for some of this. Keep some salty snacks and protein on hand. Favor small, frequent, mixed-macro meals; very heavy, high‑carb meals can cause post‑meal dips.\n- Move your legs and core every 20–30 minutes: ankle pumps, calf squeezes, buttock and thigh clenches. Get up for a brief walk every 1–2 hours if you feel steady.\n- Avoid overheating: open the vent, remove layers, cool cloths on neck/face.\n\nAt the very first hint of symptoms\n- Do physical counter‑pressure maneuvers (proven to abort many vasovagal episodes):\n  - Cross legs tightly and simultaneously tense thighs/abs/bum for 30–45 seconds; or\n  - Grip a rolled towel or your armrest as hard as you can; or\n  - Isometric arm/leg presses and repeated calf raises while seated.\n- Recline the seat, put your head down, elevate your legs on your bag if possible, loosen tight clothing, and direct the air vent to your face.\n- Sip electrolyte drink. Use paced breathing (in 4 seconds, out 6 seconds) to avoid hyperventilation.\n- Tell the crew early. If symptoms don’t resolve quickly, it’s reasonable to ask for supplemental oxygen; they can also help you lie flat if needed.\n\nIf you do faint\n- Recovery is usually quick once you’re horizontal. Stay down, hydrate, keep cool, and don’t stand abruptly for at least 15–20 minutes. Expect to feel tired for the day.\n\nFine‑tuning your current routine\n- Your current steps are good. Consider upgrading to waist‑high compression, adding an abdominal binder, and swapping some of the plain water for electrolyte solution.\n- Salt tablets can help, but pairing them with fluids and salty foods is often better tolerated than tablets alone.\n- Caffeine: if you’re sensitive, skipping is reasonable; otherwise a small amount may support blood pressure. Avoid large doses.\n- When waking from sleep on board: sit for a few minutes, do leg/abdominal tensing, take a few sips of fluid, then stand slowly if you need to.\n\nWhen to seek re‑evaluation urgently\n- Fainting during exercise, while lying down, or with chest pain/palpitations, a family history of sudden cardiac death, significant injury from a episode, or new neurologic symptoms. These would warrant renewed cardiac evaluation and possibly heart rhythm monitoring.\n\nTravel checklist\n- Waist‑high compression and/or abdominal binder\n- Electrolyte packets, salty/protein snacks\n- Refillable bottle\n- Light layers; cooling wipes\n- A brief note for cabin crew outlining your syncope plan\n- Optional: discuss a trial prescription (midodrine or fludrocortisone) with your doctor beforehand\n\nBottom line: Your history strongly suggests vasovagal/orthostatic syncope exacerbated by flight conditions. With proactive hydration/salt, full‑length compression, counter‑pressure maneuvers, temperature management, and crew awareness, many people significantly reduce or eliminate in‑flight episodes. If despite these steps you’re still fainting, a tilt‑table test and a discussion about midodrine or fludrocortisone would be reasonable next steps.",

    "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
    "answer": "I’m sorry you’ve been dealing with this—both the health changes and feeling dismissed. What you’re describing (sudden, reproducible “about-to-pass-out” exhaustion 10–15 minutes into activity) isn’t typical “just being out of shape,” and it’s reasonable to ask for a thorough evaluation.\n\nA few possibilities to consider and discuss with your clinicians\n- Medication effects: Levetiracetam (Keppra) can cause fatigue, low stamina, and mood changes that sap motivation. Some people do better on an alternative (for example, lamotrigine is often more “activating”). If your seizures allow, a trial switch might be reasonable.\n- Sleep apnea or other sleep disorders: Very common after weight gain and strongly linked to daytime fatigue and worse seizure control. A sleep study is worth pursuing—treating apnea often improves daytime energy and seizure burden.\n- Orthostatic intolerance/POTS or dysautonomia: If your heart rate shoots up or you feel lightheaded within minutes of standing or exercising, this may fit. It can start after major illness. Look for HR rise >30 bpm (or >120 bpm) within 10 minutes standing, palpitations, “grey-out,” brain fog, improved symptoms when lying down.\n- Cardiac causes of exertional presyncope: Arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or ischemia can cause the “I might pass out” feeling with activity. This deserves rule-out, especially if it’s consistent and quick with exertion.\n- Endocrine/metabolic issues: Anemia, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency, low B12, low vitamin D, electrolyte issues, diabetes, or adrenal problems can all blunt exercise tolerance.\n- Mood/psychological load: Depression, anxiety, and Keppra-related irritability can dramatically reduce perceived energy and the ability to push through exertion. Treatable, but shouldn’t be used to dismiss your symptoms.\n- Less common: Neuromuscular or mitochondrial disorders, medication interactions, or post-viral syndromes.\n\nAbout autoimmune disease and “leaky gut”\n- Autoimmune epilepsy is real but uncommon. Clues include rapid onset in adulthood, refractory/frequent seizures, cognitive or psychiatric changes out of proportion, movement disorders, autonomic problems, hyponatremia, and MRI/CSF abnormalities. If any of those fit, ask about an autoimmune/encephalitis workup (EEG, MRI with epilepsy protocol, CSF, and neural antibody panels such as LGI1, CASPR2, NMDA, GAD65).\n- “Leaky gut” is a loosely used term. While gut–brain connections and microbiome differences in epilepsy are being studied, a direct, proven link between increased intestinal permeability and causing epilepsy or your kind of exertional intolerance isn’t established. That said, medically supervised dietary therapies (ketogenic or modified Atkins) do have evidence for seizure control and can aid weight; they require neurologist/dietitian oversight.\n\nWhat to ask for next\n- Cardiology evaluation for exertional presyncope:\n  - Resting ECG\n  - Echocardiogram\n  - Ambulatory monitor (e.g., 7–14 day patch) to catch arrhythmias\n  - Exercise treadmill test (with BP/HR monitoring)\n  - Orthostatic vitals in clinic; consider tilt-table test if POTS suspected\n- Labs:\n  - CBC, CMP, fasting glucose/A1c\n  - TSH and free T4\n  - Ferritin/iron panel, B12, folate, vitamin D\n  - Morning cortisol if symptoms suggest adrenal issues\n- Sleep medicine: In-lab polysomnography for sleep apnea.\n- Neurology (preferably an epileptologist at a comprehensive epilepsy center):\n  - Review MRI (epilepsy protocol) and EEG history\n  - Discuss medication side effects and whether a switch from levetiracetam is reasonable\n  - If red flags are present, consider autoimmune epilepsy workup\n  - Discuss dietary therapy options if appropriate\n- Mental health: Screen for depression/anxiety; address Keppra-related mood effects. Some clinicians try vitamin B6 for Keppra irritability; ask your neurologist first.\n\nPractical things you can start tracking\n- Orthostatic vitals at home: HR and BP after 10 minutes lying down, then at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes standing. Note symptoms.\n- During a light, supervised walk, record time to symptom onset, HR, and perceived exertion. If you have a pulse oximeter, note SpO2.\n- Sleep: snoring, awakenings, daytime sleepiness.\n- A concise timeline of when the exercise intolerance started relative to your seizure and starting Keppra.\n\nSafety until you’re evaluated\n- Avoid pushing through to near-syncope; stop activity if lightheaded, chest pain, or short of breath.\n- Favor recumbent exercise (recumbent bike, rowing) and gradual, interval-based increases if tolerated.\n- Hydration and adequate salt (unless you have a reason to limit) can help orthostatic symptoms; compression stockings may help if standing worsens things.\n- Seek urgent care for true fainting, chest pain, palpitations with near-syncope, or breathlessness.\n\nHow to advocate in appointments\n- Lead with the red flag: “Within 10–15 minutes of light-to-moderate exercise I feel like I’m going to pass out; this started right after my seizure/starting Keppra and never resolved.” Bring the data you’ve logged.\n- Ask plainly for the cardiac, sleep, and autonomic evaluations listed above, and a medication review.\n- If you feel unheard, request referrals or a second opinion (epilepsy center, autonomic clinic, or cardiology).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- Whether your HR jumps with standing/exertion, and any chest pain/palpitations\n- Snoring or excessive daytime sleepiness\n- Mood changes since starting Keppra\n- What your last MRI/EEG showed\nI can help tailor a one-page summary to take to your doctors and prioritize next steps.",

    "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I’ve been experiencing “freezes” and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I’m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don’t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I’ve had daily moments of “freezing” which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an “aura” feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I’ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I’ve been having about 5 second “lags” which isn’t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",
    "answer": "I’m sorry this happened — that sounds frightening and understandably confusing. The normal ER tests are reassuring for emergencies, but they don’t rule out seizures or other neurologic causes. What you describe needs prompt outpatient evaluation.\n\nWhat this could be (most to consider)\n- Focal (partial) seizures, often temporal-lobe: brief “freezing” or staring, speech arrest, fixed gaze, feeling unreal/dreamlike, trouble processing, then a few seconds of lag. Events typically last 10–120 seconds and can recur daily.\n- Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)/functional episodes: can include prolonged hyperventilation, retained awareness or patchy memory, inability to move/speak, and long duration (e.g., 20 minutes) after a trigger. These are real, treatable neurologic conditions but not due to abnormal electrical brain activity.\n- Panic/hyperventilation syndrome: can cause intense nausea, heat, derealization, tingling, and “stuck” feeling; typically lasts minutes, may follow stress or bodily sensations.\n- Less likely but worth checking: migraine aura without headache (usually 5–60 minutes rather than 10–20 seconds), metabolic issues (low calcium/magnesium, glucose), thyroid problems.\n\nAbout the nitrous oxide\n- A single dental exposure almost never causes seizures directly the next day.\n- However, nitrous can inactivate vitamin B12. If you were already B12-deficient (risk: vegan/vegetarian, low B12 diet, metformin use, GI disorders, prior bariatric surgery, pernicious anemia), it can trigger neurologic symptoms over days–weeks (numbness/tingling, gait changes, weakness, cognitive changes). Given the timing and your symptoms, this is worth testing now because it’s easy to treat and missing it can cause ongoing problems.\n\nWhat to do now\n- Try to expedite your neurology appointment. Given daily events, ask if they can see you sooner or place you on a cancellation list.\n- Testing to request:\n  - EEG, and ideally prolonged/ambulatory EEG if routine EEG is non-diagnostic.\n  - Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol.\n  - Labs: vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), homocysteine, CBC, CMP (including calcium, magnesium), TSH, fasting glucose; pregnancy test if applicable.\n- Safety until cleared:\n  - Do not drive, swim alone, climb heights/ladders, bathe in a tub, or operate heavy machinery.\n  - Sleep regularly, avoid alcohol/recreational drugs, stay hydrated, don’t skip meals.\n- If you sense an episode coming: sit or lie down on your side, loosen tight clothing, and try slow breathing (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6–8 seconds). Ask someone to time the event and, if safe, record a short video — this is very helpful to neurologists.\n- First aid for bystanders: protect from falls, nothing in mouth, don’t restrain, time it, recovery on side. Call emergency services if any event lasts >5 minutes, there are repeated back-to-back events, significant injury, or prolonged confusion.\n\nRed flags — seek urgent care/ER if you develop:\n- New persistent weakness, numbness, severe headache, stiff neck, high fever, repeated vomiting, confusion, or another prolonged event lasting >5 minutes.\n\nA few questions that help narrow this:\n- Did anyone notice lip-smacking, hand picking, or fumbling during episodes? Tongue biting (especially on the side) or incontinence? How confused or tired were you after?\n- Any risk factors for low B12 (diet, metformin, GI issues, prior B12 deficiency)?\n- Any new meds or substances (including bupropion, tramadol, stimulants, THC, supplements)?\n- Sleep deprivation or major stress lately?\n- Do the brief “freezes” cluster around your menstrual cycle?\n\nBottom line\n- Your symptoms fit best with focal seizures or PNES; both require a neurologic workup with EEG/MRI. Ask your PCP to order B12/MMA/homocysteine now and to expedite neurology. Follow the safety steps above until you’re evaluated. If you share short videos and a log of events (time, duration, what you felt, triggers), it can speed diagnosis and treatment.",

    "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",
    "answer": "Short answer: Yes—lack of oxygen at birth (often called perinatal asphyxia or hypoxic‑ischemic encephalopathy, HIE) can increase the risk of several later neurodevelopmental issues. That doesn’t prove it caused yours, but it’s a plausible contributor.\n\nWhat happens in birth asphyxia\n- The brain gets too little oxygen/blood for a period. Care teams stabilize breathing/circulation; some centers use cooling (“therapeutic hypothermia”) in the first 6 hours of life to reduce brain injury. Monitors at home afterward were likely to watch breathing/heart rate.\n- Outcomes vary widely by severity. Many babies do very well; others can have later difficulties.\n\nPossible long‑term effects (risk rises with more severe HIE, but even mild cases can have subtle effects)\n- Attention/executive function: Higher rates of ADHD‑like symptoms, processing speed and working‑memory challenges, and learning difficulties.\n- Epilepsy: Risk is increased, especially if there were neonatal seizures or clear brain injury on imaging. Some people are photosensitive.\n- Motor: Ranges from normal to cerebral palsy in severe cases.\n- Vision/hearing: Cortical visual processing issues or hearing loss can occur.\n- Mental health: Anxiety, depression can be more common.\n\nYour specific concerns\n- ADHD/ADD: Research shows an elevated risk after perinatal hypoxia. It’s hard to prove causation for one person, but your history fits a known pattern. Treatment (behavioral strategies, stimulants or non‑stimulants) is still appropriate.\n- Reactions to flashing lights: Could be migraine photophobia, visual discomfort, anxiety, or photosensitive seizures. Photosensitive epilepsy often causes brief staring, eyelid flutter, facial or arm jerks, or loss of awareness triggered by strobe/flashing patterns; there may be confusion or fatigue afterward. If anything like this happens, it’s worth an evaluation.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Ask your PCP for:\n  - Neurology referral.\n  - EEG with photic stimulation to check for photosensitivity; consider brain MRI if there’s any concern for old injury and you’ve never had imaging.\n  - ADHD evaluation if you haven’t had a formal one; treat as indicated. Stimulants are generally safe in people without epilepsy; even in epilepsy they can often be used with monitoring—coordinate with neurology if needed.\n- Practical steps for light sensitivity:\n  - Avoid intense strobe environments; use polarized sunglasses or blue‑blocking lenses as helpful.\n  - Use high‑refresh‑rate screens (120 Hz+), reduce screen brightness/contrast, enable “reduce motion”/anti‑flicker settings; avoid older fluorescent lighting.\n  - Keep regular sleep, limit alcohol/recreational drugs, and manage stress since these lower seizure thresholds.\n- Try to obtain birth records if possible (Apgar scores, whether there were neonatal seizures, imaging, cooling details). They help estimate lifetime risks.\n\nSeek urgent care if you ever have a first suspected seizure, loss of consciousness, prolonged confusion, a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, or a significant head injury.\n\nIf you’re open to it, a few details would help tailor advice:\n- What exactly happens during your reactions to flashing lights (any jerks, blank spells, lost time, headache, nausea)?\n- Any history of fainting, unexplained injuries, or waking with bitten tongue/muscle soreness?\n- Have you ever had an EEG or brain MRI?\n- Are you currently on ADHD medication, and how do you tolerate it?",

    "question": "Age – 25 Sex – Male Height - 183cm 6ft Weight - 92kg 200lb Race – Caucasian Duration - Last 3 months Symptoms ive experienced over the last 3 months Around 2months ago i was experiencing Phantom smells, brief periods of 3-4second smells; started off as a blood smell and then startedto get them more frequently and smells were sometimes oranges/flowers. I Have since had an EEG that said i had no Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. I've not had these smells for a few weeks in the last 2 weeks i have started to notice eye floaters that follow where my eye goes only in sunlight. I have also noticed Bright flashing lights from the outter right corner of my eye. Some less worrying symptoms i have had. Sometimes 1 ear will get a high pitch noise that starts loud and fades out Muscle twitching hadaches sometimes. nothing severe Lightheadedness that may be related to anxiety/ or my low iron Sometimes cant think of the word i was thinking of or lose train of thought. Feel like im staring through what im looking at, kinda get daydreamy i guess? Also i do have a front tooth that is decaying / has a hole between the front and front right I have Severe anxiety and depression; and have been through a period of very high stress the last 3 months after breaking up with my long term partner. Is it possible that stress can do all these things to the body... my GP dosent seem worried about brain tumours but i am.",
    "answer": "Short answer: Stress and anxiety can cause many of the symptoms you describe (ringing in one ear, muscle twitches, headaches, lightheadedness, brain fog/word-finding issues, “daydreamy” feeling). A brain tumor is unlikely given your age and the pattern of symptoms, and your normal EEG is somewhat reassuring (though it doesn’t completely rule out seizures). That said, one part of your story needs prompt eye evaluation.\n\nWhat needs attention now\n- New floaters plus bright flashes in the outer right visual field: This can be from the retina being tugged (posterior vitreous detachment) and occasionally a retinal tear/detachment. Please arrange a same‑day dilated eye exam with an optometrist/ophthalmologist, or go to urgent care/ED if you can’t be seen quickly. Go immediately if you notice any of the following: a curtain/shadow over part of your vision, a sudden big increase in floaters, new blurry or missing areas of vision, or eye pain.\n\nAbout the phantom smells (phantosmia)\n- Common causes: migraine aura, sinus/nasal issues (including infections or polyps), dental problems (upper teeth can affect the maxillary sinus), post-viral changes, and less often seizures.\n- Your brief, seconds-long episodes that resolved, plus a normal EEG and no other clear seizure events, make epilepsy or a brain tumor less likely. If the smells come back or persist, see your GP or an ENT; they may examine your nose/sinuses and consider an MRI if symptoms are ongoing or associated with other focal neurologic signs.\n\nOther symptoms you mentioned\n- Tinnitus that starts loud and fades: common and usually benign. If it becomes persistent in one ear, is pulsatile (whooshing), or accompanied by hearing loss/vertigo, see an ENT or audiologist.\n- Muscle twitching: often from stress, caffeine, poor sleep, dehydration, or low minerals (magnesium). Usually benign unless there’s true weakness, muscle wasting, or twitches are constant.\n- Headaches: tension and migraine are both commonly triggered by stress/anxiety and poor sleep.\n- Lightheadedness/brain fog/word-finding issues: anxiety, poor sleep, and low iron can all do this. Iron deficiency in men should be confirmed and evaluated before starting iron supplements.\n- Dental decay: please see a dentist—dental infections can contribute to sinus issues and systemic symptoms.\n\nHow likely is a brain tumor?\n- Brain tumors at 25 are rare. Warning signs would include steadily worsening headaches (especially morning headaches with vomiting), seizures, progressive weakness or numbness on one side, persistent word-finding difficulty or personality changes, double vision, or papilledema on eye exam. Your symptoms don’t clearly fit that pattern. If your worry is high or symptoms progress, discuss a brain MRI with your GP for reassurance.\n\nPractical next steps\n- Same-day dilated eye exam for the flashes/floaters.\n- Dentist visit for the decayed tooth.\n- Ask your GP about basic labs: CBC, ferritin/iron studies, B12, TSH, CMP, vitamin D. Treat iron deficiency only if confirmed.\n- Lifestyle: good sleep, hydration, regular meals, limit caffeine/alcohol, daily light exercise.\n- Consider magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg nightly for twitches/headache prevention if your kidneys are healthy; stop if you get diarrhea and confirm with your GP.\n- Mental health: given severe anxiety/depression and recent high stress, therapy (CBT), and/or medications can help both mood and physical symptoms. If you ever have thoughts of harming yourself, seek urgent help or call your local crisis line immediately.\n\nIf you can, share a bit more about the eye flashes:\n- Are they only in the right eye if you cover one eye at a time?\n- Do they look like brief arcs or lightning when you move the eye (more ocular), or like shimmering zigzags that last 5–60 minutes (more migraine)?\n- Any shadow/curtain or new vision loss?\n\nI know health anxiety can make all of this feel frightening. Addressing the eye symptom promptly, fixing the tooth, checking labs, and treating stress/anxiety usually makes the rest improve significantly.",

    "question": "Hello all, I had a question about my medication and fasting, if that's alright. I take Keppra twice a day (500mg each), once in the morning and once at night. With Ramadan approaching I was wondering how much time there needs to be in between taking one pill at night and one in the morning, thanks.Let me know if I need to add anything else.",
    "answer": "Great question—and it’s smart to plan ahead.\n\nShort answer:\n- Immediate‑release levetiracetam (Keppra) 500 mg is meant to be taken every ~12 hours.\n- During Ramadan, most people take it at Iftar (sunset) and again just before Suhoor/Fajr (dawn) to maximize the gap.\n- Aim for about 12 hours between doses. If that’s not possible, many clinicians are comfortable with 10 hours, and sometimes as little as ~8 hours if necessary—ideally only with your neurologist’s OK.\n\nIf your night is shorter than ~8 hours (common in some locations/seasons), speak with your prescriber now about:\n- Switching to once‑daily extended‑release levetiracetam (XR), which can cover the 24‑hour period, or\n- Another dosing plan tailored to your fasting hours and seizure history.\n\nAdditional tips:\n- Take doses consistently at the same times each day (Iftar and just before Suhoor).\n- Food doesn’t significantly affect levetiracetam, so you can take it with or without food.\n- Don’t skip doses; if you accidentally miss one, take it when you remember unless it’s close to the next dose—don’t double up. Ask your prescriber for a personalized missed‑dose plan.\n- Maintain sleep as best you can and hydrate well during non‑fasting hours; sleep deprivation and dehydration can lower seizure threshold.\n- If you have kidney disease, dosing may need adjustment—important to review before Ramadan.\n- If you experience auras or breakthrough seizures, seek medical advice promptly; for safety, many religious authorities permit breaking the fast for health.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you set a specific schedule. Useful details to share:\n- Your city/country (to estimate sunset‑to‑dawn interval during Ramadan)\n- Whether your Keppra is immediate‑release or extended‑release\n- How well your seizures are currently controlled and any recent breakthroughs\n- Any kidney issues or other daily medications\n- Your prescriber’s plan or preferences for Ramadan dosing\n\nThis is general information—please confirm your plan with your neurologist before Ramadan.",

    "question": "Recently I got a hickie, and tons of people started telling me to be careful because I could die, and stuff. Is it that dangerous? Male 17, epilepsy, anxiety, question: are hickies dangerous?",
    "answer": "Short answer: No—hickies are usually not dangerous.\n\nWhat a hickey is: a small bruise from suction that breaks tiny blood vessels in the skin. It typically fades in 1–2 weeks.\n\nRare but real risks (mostly with hard suction/bites on the neck):\n- Carotid artery injury or a small clot leading to stroke: reported, but extremely rare (only case reports).\n- Fainting from pressure on the carotid sinus (uncommon in young people).\n- Skin infection if the skin is broken.\n- Bigger bruises if you’re on blood thinners or have a bleeding tendency.\n\nEpilepsy: A hickey itself doesn’t trigger seizures. The only indirect concern would be if strong neck pressure made you faint, which is unlikely; otherwise it doesn’t pose a special risk to someone with epilepsy.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care after a neck hickey:\n- Sudden weakness or numbness on one side, face droop, trouble speaking, vision changes, severe headache, or loss of balance.\n- Rapidly enlarging, very painful neck swelling.\n- Signs of infection (increasing redness, warmth, pus, red streaks, fever).\n\nSelf-care:\n- First 24 hours: cold pack 10–15 minutes at a time, a few times a day.\n- After 48 hours: warm compresses to help it fade.\n- Don’t “scrape,” brush, or use suction gadgets—these can worsen bruising.\n- If the skin is broken, keep it clean. Avoid aspirin right away as it can increase bleeding.\n\nPrevention:\n- If you’re worried, avoid strong suction/biting on the front/side of the neck over the carotid arteries; choose other areas with less risk.\n\nIf you notice you bruise very easily or have frequent nosebleeds, mention it to your doctor—some meds (e.g., valproate) can affect platelets. Otherwise, try not to stress: for most people, a hickey is just a harmless bruise.",

    "question": "30 AFAB, 158cm/61kg, hispanic, Symptoms: lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods. flu-ish [see below] since a month ago.Diagnoses: Epilepsy, ADHD, Endometriosis, 5cm ovarian cyst, migrainesMedications: Lamotrigine 225mg, Ibuprofen for endometriosis pain, very occasional Concerta, haven't used it for a few months, melatonin over the summer (stopped it about two months ago)Others: Drink 1-2 drinks monthly, Slowly stopping smoking down from 6 to 1-2 per day and 1 light snus, last two days have started taking Vitamin D and I have been using a therapy lamp for 20 min every morning for the last two weeks. Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",
    "answer": "Short answer: With a month of lightheadedness/fatigue that’s limiting exercise, persistently darker urine, new menstrual changes, and increased ovarian pain with a known 5 cm cyst, it’s reasonable to book a fastlege (GP) appointment within the next 1–2 weeks. Go to urgent care sooner if any red-flag symptoms below happen.\n\nWhy see your doctor now\n- Your symptoms are persistent, new for you, and affecting daily life.\n- A 5 cm ovarian cyst with increasing pain deserves re-evaluation to rule out torsion, rupture, or worrisome features.\n- Darker urine despite high fluid intake and fatigue warrant basic labs and a urinalysis to check for dehydration, infection, liver/kidney issues, or blood.\n- Lightheadedness on exertion and low motivation can be from iron deficiency, thyroid issues, post-viral fatigue, low blood pressure/POTS, depression, or other causes—most are easy to screen for.\n\nRed flags – seek same-day/urgent care (legevakt/ER) if you have:\n- Sudden, severe one-sided pelvic/lower abdominal pain, often with nausea/vomiting (possible ovarian torsion).\n- Fainting, chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or a very fast/irregular heartbeat.\n- Fever >38°C with pelvic pain, or worsening pain with vomiting you can’t control.\n- Tea/cola-brown urine, yellowing of the eyes/skin, very pale stools, or severe right‑upper abdominal pain (possible liver/bile issue, can rarely be medication-related).\n- Visible blood in urine, or inability to pass urine.\n- Positive pregnancy test with pelvic pain or bleeding.\n\nWhat to ask your GP to check\n- Exam and orthostatic vitals (lying vs standing heart rate and BP) to screen for orthostatic hypotension/POTS.\n- Blood tests: CBC, ferritin and iron studies, TSH/free T4, basic metabolic panel (kidney function/electrolytes), liver panel (AST/ALT/ALP/bilirubin), CRP. Consider B12/folate and 25‑OH vitamin D.\n- Urine tests: urinalysis with microscopy +/- culture.\n- Pregnancy test (even if home tests negative, just to be sure).\n- Gynecologic evaluation: pelvic exam and a transvaginal ultrasound to reassess the cyst (size, solid areas, septations, Doppler flow). If ultrasound looks atypical, your GP may add CA‑125 and refer to gynecology. Bring details of any family ovarian/breast/colon/uterine cancers and ages at diagnosis; you may qualify for genetic counseling.\n- If periods remain very light/irregular: consider prolactin, FSH/LH, and androgens if PCOS suspected.\n- If palpitations or presyncope continue: ECG.\n\nNotes on your specific concerns\n- Ovarian cyst and exercise: Cysts ≥5 cm carry a higher torsion risk. Until re-imaged, avoid high‑impact activities, sudden twisting, deep abdominal core work, or heavy lifting. Gentle walking, cycling, or low‑impact strength is okay if pain-free.\n- Light periods: Can be due to stress/weight change, thyroid issues, PCOS, post-viral effects, or hormonal fluctuations. Pregnancy tests being negative is reassuring, but still worth a workup given the change since last September.\n- Darker urine: Vitamin D doesn’t typically cause this. Common causes are dehydration, B‑vitamin supplements (bright yellow), or concentrated urine; less commonly liver/blood in urine. A urinalysis and liver/kidney tests will clarify.\n- Fatigue/lightheadedness: Iron deficiency (especially with past heavy periods), thyroid problems, post‑viral syndrome, low BP/POTS, sleep issues, and depression are all on the table. Easy to screen for.\n- Medications: Lamotrigine rarely affects the liver; ibuprofen can affect kidneys or stomach if used frequently. Your labs will help ensure these are safe for you currently. Seek care urgently if you notice jaundice or cola-colored urine.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Hydration with electrolytes (especially around exercise). Track urine color through the day.\n- Check orthostatic vitals at home if you can: measure HR/BP after 5 minutes lying down, then at 1 and 3 minutes standing. If HR rises ≥30 bpm (or >120 bpm) or BP drops ≥20/10 mmHg with symptoms, mention this to your GP.\n- Keep a brief symptom diary: pain episodes (side, severity, triggers), urine color, period dates/flow, temperature, any new symptoms.\n- Pain: use the lowest effective dose of ibuprofen, take with food, and avoid back‑to‑back high doses. Consider heat packs. If you’re needing frequent NSAIDs, tell your GP.\n- Seasonal mood: continue morning light therapy and vitamin D (commonly 1000–2000 IU daily unless your doctor advises otherwise), prioritize daylight exposure and sleep regularity.\n\nBottom line\n- Book a GP appointment within 1–2 weeks for labs, urine testing, orthostatic vitals, and a pelvic ultrasound referral. That alone is “justified” by your symptom duration and impact.\n- Go to urgent care now if you develop sudden severe one-sided pelvic pain with nausea/vomiting, faint, have cola-colored urine or jaundice, or significant fever with pelvic pain.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a short note to your fastlege summarizing your symptoms and the specific tests you’d like checked.",

    "question": "I’m (40F) 5ft 8, 164lbs, caucasian. Medications: Lamotrigine and Sertraline Health conditions: ADHD, Tourette’s, epilepsy and severe degenerative disc disease. I don’t have a current issue but every time I’ve had surgery I wake up completely full of beans, even when I’ve just woken up in recovery. I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can’t stop giggling.

I’m not sure if it’s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I’ve never been told I’m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I’ve been wondering for years.",
    "answer": "Short answer: what you describe is a fairly common “phenotype” and likely reflects a mix of your individual drug metabolism and the specific meds anesthetists typically give.\n\nWhy you wake up euphoric/energetic and not nauseated\n- Dexamethasone “steroid high”: Many anesthetists give IV dexamethasone near the start of surgery to prevent nausea and reduce swelling. In some people it causes hours of euphoria, restlessness/energy, increased appetite and thirst, and less pain perception for a while.\n- Smooth, fast-acting anesthetics: Modern agents (propofol, sevoflurane) wear off quickly, so some people awaken chatty and “clear.” If you also received a small dose of ketamine, that can add to a bright mood and good pain relief for several hours.\n- Good multimodal pain control: You may be getting intra‑op acetaminophen, ketorolac, local anesthetic infiltration/nerve blocks, and small doses of potent opioids (fentanyl/hydromorphone), which can blunt pain for hours.\n- Catecholamine/adrenaline surge: Waking from anesthesia can trigger a temporary boost in adrenaline and dopamine, which can feel like energy, giggles, and reduced pain sensitivity.\n\nWhy codeine does nothing for you\n- Codeine is a pro‑drug that must be converted by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 into morphine to work. Two common reasons it fails:\n  - CYP2D6 poor metabolizer genotype (fairly common in people of European ancestry).\n  - Drug interaction: sertraline inhibits CYP2D6 to some extent, reducing that conversion. Tramadol and often hydrocodone are similarly affected.\n- Practical implication: For you, morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, or (usually) oxycodone are better choices than codeine, tramadol, or hydrocodone. Tramadol and meperidine also raise seizure risk and can interact with sertraline (serotonin syndrome), so they’re best avoided in epilepsy.\n\nNeeding extra local anesthetic at the dentist\n- Several possibilities, not dangerous but useful for your dentist/anesthetist to know:\n  - Normal variation in nerve anatomy or higher anesthetic requirement.\n  - MC1R variants (more common in natural redheads) are linked to higher anesthetic needs and more local anesthetic resistance, even in some non‑redheads.\n  - Connective tissue disorders (for example hypermobility/EDS) are associated with local anesthetic resistance.\n  - Infection/inflammation at the site can reduce effectiveness on that day.\n- Practical tips to discuss with your dentist: articaine for infiltrations, buffering with bicarbonate, using nerve blocks instead of infiltrations (or both), intraligamentary/intraosseous injections, or light sedation if needed.\n\nWhat to tell your anesthetist/dentist before procedures\n- Codeine and tramadol don’t work for you (and you take sertraline and have epilepsy).\n- You tend to wake very alert and energetic; if that’s ever problematic, they can adjust the plan (for example, less midazolam if paradoxical, or a touch of dexmedetomidine at the end for a smoother, calmer wake‑up).\n- Local anesthetic often requires higher doses or different techniques.\n- Continue lamotrigine as prescribed; avoid tramadol/meperidine post‑op.\n\nOptional next steps\n- Ask for your prior anesthesia records to see what you were given (especially dexamethasone, ketamine, and antiemetics).\n- Consider CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic testing once in your chart; it can guide future pain‑med choices.\n- If you have notable joint hypermobility, mention it; it can support tailoring local anesthetic technique.\n\nA small caution: even if you feel fantastic right after surgery, protect the surgical site and start scheduled pain meds before the numb period wears off to avoid a pain “catch‑up.”\n\nIf you want, I can suggest a short note you can bring to future anesthetic/dental visits.",

    "question": "20 year old old Female. I’m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I’ve been on it for about two years. I’ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I’ve been going through the withdrawals but it’s been easing and the symptoms weren’t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I’ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn’t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can’t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it’s back. I’m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn’t so bad it’s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn’t help.",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing all of that—it helps. A few things could be contributing at once: stopping amitriptyline (which can cause “rebound” gut cramps/urgency for 1–2 weeks), a functional gut issue like IBS (common at your age and often linked with anxiety), or less commonly a bladder issue or pregnancy-related cause. Let’s sort it out and keep you safe.\n\nFirst, a couple clarifying questions\n- When you feel you “need the bathroom,” is it to pass stool, to urinate, or both?\n- Any blood or mucus in stool, black/tarry stools, fever, vomiting, weight loss, burning with urination, or back/flank pain?\n- Where exactly is the pain (upper vs lower abdomen, center vs one side)? Does it improve after passing gas or trying to have a bowel movement?\n- Any new foods, recent travel/illness, antibiotics, or NSAID use (like ibuprofen/naproxen)?\n\nWhat could be going on\n- Amitriptyline withdrawal: Stopping a TCA can cause cholinergic “rebound” with abdominal cramps, urgency/tenesmus, diarrhea, chills/shakes, and anxiety—usually starts within a few days and eases over 1–2 weeks. You also had a similar episode months ago, so it may not be the only cause.\n- IBS or gut hypersensitivity: The constant urge to go even when you don’t (tenesmus), gurgling, and anxiety links fit. Symptoms can flare with certain foods and stress and may worsen around menstrual changes.\n- Less likely but important to rule out: UTI/interstitial cystitis (if urinary urgency/burning), inflammatory bowel disease (if red flags), pregnancy-related issues (your period is 23 days late), or gynecologic causes (ovarian cyst, endometriosis).\n\nImmediate steps you can take\n1) Take a home pregnancy test today. If positive or if you have severe one-sided pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding, seek urgent care to rule out ectopic pregnancy.\n2) If your “bathroom” urge is urinary: get a urine dipstick/urinalysis this week (walk-in clinic/GP) to check for UTI.\n3) Gentle gut care for the next 3–5 days:\n   - Small, frequent meals; bland, low-fat foods. Try lactose-free for a week. Avoid carbonated drinks, caffeine (even decaf green tea has some), spicy/greasy foods, and high-sorbitol sweeteners. Honey can be a trigger (high FODMAP) for some—try pausing it.\n   - Hydration with water or oral rehydration solution; avoid sodas.\n   - Peppermint oil capsules (enteric-coated) before meals can reduce cramping; peppermint or ginger tea may help.\n   - Soluble fiber: psyllium husk 1 tsp daily with plenty of water (increase slowly). This can help both constipation and loose stools.\n   - For gas/bloating: simethicone as needed.\n   - If diarrhea: loperamide can be used short-term as directed. If constipation, use a gentle osmotic like polyethylene glycol.\n4) Anxiety management during flares:\n   - Slow breathing (4–6 breaths per minute), heat pack to abdomen, short walks.\n   - Remind yourself gut pain is often benign even when uncomfortable.\n\nMedicines and safety\n- Keep taking Keppra consistently; dehydration or significant diarrhea can increase seizure risk. If you can’t keep fluids down, seek care.\n- Paracetamol is okay for pain/migraine. Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen) as they can irritate the gut and sometimes worsen asthma.\n- Amitriptyline: If withdrawal symptoms become unmanageable, contact your prescriber. Sometimes a brief reinstatement at a low dose with a slower taper helps, but do not restart without discussing, especially with your epilepsy and migraine history.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care now\n- Severe or worsening constant abdominal pain, especially localized (e.g., right lower side), or pain with guarding.\n- Vomiting that prevents fluids, high fever, fainting, or signs of dehydration.\n- Blood in stool, black/tarry stools, or persistent diarrhea >7 days.\n- Unexplained weight loss.\n- Positive pregnancy test, or severe pelvic pain/bleeding.\n\nFollow-up\n- Book a GP visit in the next 1–2 weeks to review: persistent symptoms, your late/irregular periods, and the amitriptyline discontinuation plan. They may check basic labs (CBC, CRP), celiac screen, stool calprotectin if diarrhea, urine test, and consider IBS management. Low-dose TCAs are sometimes used for IBS pain—this can be discussed in the context of your epilepsy.\n- If you share a bit more about the pain location, stool/urine details, and any red-flag symptoms, I can help narrow this further and tailor your plan.",

    "question": "Gender: Female, Age: 9, Height: Idk tbh, Location: Head, How long ago: 1 week.So my co-workers daughter was just diagnosed with grey matter heterotopia. She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren’t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",
    "answer": "You’re a kind friend for wanting to help. Here’s a clear, parent-friendly overview you can share. It won’t replace medical advice, but it can give some hope and a sense of what to expect while they wait.\n\nWhat “gray matter heterotopia” means\n- During early brain development, some brain cells that were supposed to move to the outer layer (cortex) stop short and form small “islands” of normal brain tissue in the wrong place. Those islands can sometimes irritate nearby brain circuits and cause seizures.\n- There are a few types, usually seen on MRI:\n  - Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH): little nodules along the brain’s fluid spaces. Many kids have normal intelligence; seizures are common but often manageable.\n  - Subcortical band heterotopia (“double cortex”): a band of gray matter under the cortex. Seizures are common; learning differences can occur.\n  - Other subcortical heterotopia: prognosis varies.\n- It’s not caused by anything the parents did. Often it’s genetic, sometimes sporadic.\n\nThe big picture and outlook\n- Many children do well in school and life, especially with PVNH. Some need learning supports (attention, reading, or processing-speed help).\n- Seizures are the main issue. A good number of kids get good control with medication. If not, there are additional options at specialized epilepsy centers.\n- Life expectancy is typically normal. The main risks come from uncontrolled seizures and safety, which can be managed.\n\nTreatment options (usually stepwise)\n1) Anti-seizure medicines (first-line)\n   - Common choices include levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, lacosamide, topiramate, and others. The team will tailor to the child and seizure type.\n   - If seizures keep happening, doctors often try a second or third medication or a combination.\n\n2) Diet therapies\n   - Ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet can reduce seizures in some children. These need a team’s guidance (dietitian/neurology).\n\n3) Surgical and device options if medicines don’t control seizures (at comprehensive epilepsy centers)\n   - Evaluation: detailed MRI, video-EEG, possibly PET/SPECT, and sometimes stereo-EEG to pinpoint where seizures start.\n   - Laser ablation (LITT) or surgical resection: In selected children—especially when seizures start in a specific nodule and/or the cortex just above it—targeted treatment can significantly reduce seizures; some become seizure-free.\n   - Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): an implanted device that can lessen seizure frequency and severity. Approved in children.\n   - Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) and deep brain stimulation are typically for older teens/adults, but evolving.\n\n4) Supports\n   - Neuropsychological testing to map strengths/weaknesses.\n   - School accommodations (504/IEP) for attention, fatigue, processing, or absences.\n\nImportant related testing to ask about\n- Genetic testing: Certain genes (for PVNH, often FLNA) can be involved. In girls with FLNA variants, doctors may also screen the heart and blood vessels (echocardiogram; sometimes vessel imaging) because connective-tissue features can travel with the diagnosis.\n- Vision and developmental assessments if there are learning or coordination concerns.\n\nWhat to do while waiting for the October visit\n- Don’t wait if seizures are frequent or prolonged. Ask the pediatrician or neurology office for:\n  - An earlier appointment or a message to the clinician about ongoing seizures.\n  - A rescue medication (like intranasal midazolam or diazepam) and instructions for when to use it.\n  - Clear guidance on when to go to the ER.\n- Keep a seizure diary:\n  - Date/time, duration, what it looked like, possible triggers (illness, missed medicine, poor sleep), and recovery time.\n  - Short phone videos of events are very helpful for the neurologist.\n- Seizure safety basics:\n  - Stay with her; time the seizure.\n  - Protect from injury; gently roll to her side.\n  - Nothing in the mouth; don’t restrain movements.\n  - Call emergency services if a seizure lasts 5 minutes, repeats without recovery, involves breathing problems or injury, or if it’s a first-time prolonged seizure.\n  - Water safety: supervised bathing/showers; caution with swimming.\n  - Avoid heights without protection; use helmets for biking.\n  - Good sleep, regular meals, hydration, and strict medication routines help reduce triggers.\n\nQuestions her parents can bring to the appointment\n- What type of heterotopia is it on MRI? One side or both? Any other brain findings?\n- What seizure type(s) does she have? What does the EEG show?\n- Which medication do you recommend first, and what are goals and side effects? What to do if seizures continue?\n- Should we consider genetic testing? If FLNA is suspected/confirmed, do we need a cardiac or vascular evaluation?\n- If medicines don’t work, when would you refer us to a comprehensive epilepsy center for surgical/laser evaluation?\n- Is diet therapy appropriate?\n- Should we have a rescue medicine? Clear plan for when to use it?\n- Can we get a neuropsych eval and help with school accommodations (504/IEP)?\n- Are there local resources or support groups?\n\nEncouraging points you can share with her mom\n- Many children with heterotopia live full, active lives. Seizures are scary, but there are multiple treatment paths, and new options like laser surgery have helped a lot of kids.\n- It’s okay to ask for an earlier call or visit, especially if seizures are ongoing. Rescue meds at home can provide peace of mind.\n- Keeping videos and a simple seizure log now will make the October visit much more productive.\n- They are not alone; there’s a strong epilepsy community and specific heterotopia groups.\n\nReliable resources\n- Epilepsy Foundation: seizure first aid, school plans, and support lines.\n- Child neurology/epilepsy centers (search “Comprehensive Epilepsy Center” or Level 4 pediatric centers).\n- PVNH Support & Awareness (for periventricular nodular heterotopia).\n- National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) pages on heterotopia.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a short, supportive message to her mom or a one-page handout with these bullet points.",

    "question": "25F, 200lb, 5’4, asthma, current medications wellbutrin SR, vyvanse, lexapro, montelukast, spironolactone. i do not drink any alcohol, use cannabis 5-7x a weekOccasionally, I will have an intense sensation of deja vu, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as disoriented. It’s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel “weird” for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it’s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to “control” whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that “I’ve been here before” feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the “next scene” so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it’s something else?",
    "answer": "Short answer: ordinary déjà vu is common and brief. What you describe—déjà vu immediately followed by a few seconds of intense nausea/dizziness/confusion and then feeling “off” for 10–30 minutes—is not typical of benign déjà vu. That pattern can happen with focal (temporal lobe) seizures, so it’s worth getting evaluated.\n\nWhy seizures are on the list:\n- Temporal lobe (focal aware) seizures often start with déjà vu or a “dreamlike” feeling, nausea, a rising stomach sensation, fear, odd tastes/smells, or brief confusion.\n- The intense part lasts seconds to a minute, and a “post-event” period of feeling washed out, nauseated, or foggy can last minutes to half an hour.\n- You had similar episodes in childhood and they’ve recurred.\n- Several of your medicines can lower the seizure threshold (bupropion/Wellbutrin and lisdexamfetamine/Vyvanse; sleep loss and cannabis can also play a role).\n\nOther possibilities (less fitting your description):\n- Migraine aura: can cause odd sensations and nausea, but aura typically lasts 5–60 minutes and déjà vu isn’t a classic aura.\n- Panic/dissociation: can cause dizziness and derealization, but usually lasts longer and isn’t consistently preceded by brief déjà vu.\n- Cannabis effects: frequent use can cause derealization, anxiety, and nausea, but the very brief intense peak followed by a post-episode “fog” is more typical of seizure than cannabis alone.\n- Orthostatic drops, hypoglycemia, etc., usually relate to posture or missed meals and aren’t tied to déjà vu.\n\nWhat to do next:\n- Make an appointment with your primary care clinician; ask for a neurology referral. Describe exactly what you wrote here.\n- Typical workup: EEG (sometimes sleep-deprived or ambulatory) and brain MRI focused on the temporal lobes; basic labs.\n- Medication review: Do not stop anything abruptly, but discuss the seizure risk of bupropion (especially if dose is ≥300 mg/day or in combination with a stimulant) and Vyvanse. If seizures are confirmed, bupropion is usually avoided.\n- Reduce seizure triggers: prioritize sleep, regular meals/hydration, manage stress, and consider cutting back cannabis until you’re evaluated.\n- Safety until evaluated: avoid swimming alone, climbing heights, baths (showers are safer), operating heavy machinery. If you ever have loss of awareness, talk with your clinician about driving restrictions (laws vary).\n\nGo to urgent/ED care if:\n- An episode includes loss of consciousness, a fall/injury, prolonged confusion (>10–15 minutes), abnormal movements, tongue biting, or incontinence.\n- New weakness, trouble speaking, severe headache, or visual changes occur.\n- Episodes are rapidly increasing in frequency or occur while driving.\n\nHelpful info to track for your visit:\n- Frequency, duration, time of day, triggers (sleep loss, stress, menstruation), any odd smells/tastes, rising stomach feeling, palpitations, or fear.\n- Whether you ever lose time, stare, or have automatisms (lip smacking, fumbling).\n- Try to have a witness describe what they see, or capture a safe video if possible.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a brief symptom diary template and a message you can send to your clinician to request a neurology referral.",

    "question": "’m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
    "answer": "Short answer: yes, it’s plausible. Heavy lifting and Valsalva-type straining can stimulate vagal reflexes and transiently drop heart rate and blood pressure. In people with GERD and a hiatal hernia, distension of the esophagus/stomach can additionally trigger vagally mediated “gastro-cardiac” reflexes (sometimes called swallow syncope or Roemheld syndrome), leading to lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. Convulsive movements during fainting are common and can be mistaken for seizures, which may explain the mixed opinions you’ve received.\n\nOther contributors to consider\n- Post-exercise vasovagal syncope: often occurs immediately after stopping intense effort when blood pools in the legs and venous return falls.\n- Valsalva during heavy lifts: reduces venous return and cerebral blood flow; can cause brief “weightlifter’s blackout.”\n- Electrolyte issues from long-term PPI use: PPIs can cause low magnesium over time, which can provoke arrhythmias or seizure-like events, especially with sweat/fluid loss from workouts. B12 deficiency can also occur.\n- Cardiac causes: exertional syncope can be dangerous if it happens during exercise (arrhythmias, structural heart disease). A normal tilt table and past cardiac tests are reassuring but don’t fully exclude intermittent rhythm problems.\n\nWhat to do next\n1. Try to capture an event on rhythm monitoring:\n   - Ask for an exercise stress test with continuous ECG monitoring aimed at reproducing symptoms.\n   - If events are infrequent, consider an extended patch monitor or an implantable loop recorder via an electrophysiologist.\n\n2. Targeted labs and checks:\n   - Serum magnesium (repeat or check RBC magnesium if available), potassium, calcium, creatinine.\n   - CBC, B12, iron studies; thyroid function.\n   - Resting ECG (look for conduction disease or QT issues); echocardiogram if not done recently.\n\n3. GERD/hiatal hernia considerations:\n   - Discuss whether your symptoms cluster with eating, carbonated/cold drinks, or reflux flares. Those patterns support a vagal gastro-cardiac reflex.\n   - If reflux/hernia is significant, ask about surgical options (hiatal hernia repair, fundoplication, or LINX) which sometimes reduce vagal-triggered events in case reports.\n   - Review PPI necessity/lowest effective dose with your GI doctor. If you remain on a PPI long-term, ensure periodic magnesium and B12 monitoring.\n\n4. Lifting and hydration strategies:\n   - Avoid breath-holding; exhale through the hardest part of the lift. Consider lowering maximal loads and using higher reps with strict breathing.\n   - Do not lift right after a large meal; avoid carbonated drinks before/during.\n   - Hydrate well and replace electrolytes, especially on hot/sweaty days. If safe for you, modestly increase salt intake around workouts.\n   - Recognize prodrome (nausea, warmth, tunnel vision, yawning). At first signs, lie down and elevate legs. Learn counter-pressure maneuvers (leg crossing, buttock/abdominal muscle tensing) for early symptoms.\n   - Cool down gradually after sets; avoid abruptly stopping after intense effort.\n\n5. Medication review:\n   - Ensure no other meds/supplements that lower blood pressure or prolong QT are contributing (e.g., alpha-blockers, nitrates, some antidepressants, antihistamines).\n   - If magnesium is low, discuss supplementation and monitoring with your clinician.\n\nRed flags that need prompt evaluation\n- Syncope during (not after) exercise, chest pain, palpitations immediately before fainting, family history of sudden cardiac death, or known structural heart disease.\n- Injury from episodes or episodes occurring without warning while sitting or driving.\n\nBottom line: Your history is compatible with a vagally mediated syncope precipitated by heavy lifting and possibly amplified by GERD/hiatal hernia, and long-term PPI use raises the possibility of electrolyte issues (especially magnesium) that can worsen things. The most useful next step is to capture an episode on ECG (ideally during or right after exertion) and check electrolytes, especially magnesium. An electrophysiologist or syncope clinic can coordinate this and advise on targeted prevention while ruling out dangerous cardiac causes.",

    "question": "29F, height 165cm, weight 74kg, caucasian. I do not smoke or have regular dairy. Weekly alcohol consumption would be 2-7 standard drinks per week at most.  also regularly have lean meat and 3 veg for lunch and dinner and a fruit smoothie for breakfast. Current diagnoses: epilepsy, mild chronic pancreatitis Regular medications are: AM: 500mg Kepra, vitamins D+magnesium PM: 500mg Kepra, vitamin D+magnesium I am awaiting follow-up with a gastroenterologist about why my pancreas could be nibbling on itself (lypase has been found to be between 70-100 on multiple occasions). I have a history of treating my anxiety with alcohol and fast food but over the last 8 years or so (since my early 20's) I've gone to therapy and gotten it really well under control. I never had these symptoms before when I had unhealthy habits but over the last year my pancreas has not been having a good time. Every month or 2 I get these very specific pains that I now know is mild chronic pancreatitis. It's never brought on by a change in routine, it's always random.",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing the details—this is understandably frustrating. At your age and with only modest alcohol intake, it’s reasonable to look carefully for non-alcohol causes of recurrent/mild chronic pancreatitis and set up a plan to reduce flares.\n\nWhat to consider as causes (to discuss with your gastroenterologist)\n- Gallbladder disease/microlithiasis: Even tiny stones/sludge can trigger recurrent inflammation. A right upper quadrant ultrasound is first-line; EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) is best for microlithiasis.\n- High triglycerides: Typically >1000 mg/dL can cause acute pancreatitis, but lower elevations may contribute. A fasting lipid panel is important.\n- High calcium: Hyperparathyroidism or excessive vitamin D can raise calcium and precipitate pancreatitis. Check calcium, PTH, and 25‑OH vitamin D (especially if taking higher-dose supplements).\n- Autoimmune pancreatitis: Check IgG4 level; sometimes responds to steroids if confirmed.\n- Anatomic variants/duct issues: Pancreas divisum, strictures, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; evaluated with MRCP (often secretin-enhanced) and/or EUS.\n- Genetic predisposition: Given onset before 35 and recurrent episodes, consider genetic testing (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC), especially if any family history of pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or unexplained abdominal issues.\n- Medication-related: Some anti-seizure meds can rarely cause pancreatitis. Valproate is a known culprit; levetiracetam (Keppra) has rare case reports. Do not stop Keppra abruptly—discuss with your neurologist and GI if the timing of symptoms lines up with starting/dose changes.\n- Other: Celiac disease, infections, trauma, or post‑ERCP (if you’ve had one), though less likely from what you’ve described.\n\nUseful tests and imaging to ask about (if not already done)\n- Fasting labs: lipid panel (especially triglycerides), calcium, PTH, liver enzymes (ALT/AST/ALP/GGT), IgG4, HbA1c/fasting glucose (to screen for pancreatogenic diabetes).\n- Stool elastase if you have greasy stools, weight loss, or bloating (to check pancreatic exocrine insufficiency).\n- Imaging: RUQ ultrasound for gallbladder; pancreatic-protocol CT or MRI/MRCP; EUS if prior studies unrevealing.\n\nDaily steps that may reduce flares\n- Alcohol: Even small amounts can worsen pancreatitis in susceptible people. Consider complete abstinence until the cause is clear and for at least several months after your last flare.\n- Diet: Small, frequent meals; keep fat modest (many use 30–50 g/day or ~25% of calories, individualized). Avoid large/fatty meals; choose lean proteins, cooked vegetables, whole grains. If you notice certain foods trigger pain, keep a simple food-symptom diary.\n- Hydration: Aim for 2–3 L nonalcoholic fluids/day unless restricted for another reason.\n- Weight: Your BMI is ~27; gradual weight loss if desired can help, but avoid crash dieting.\n- Supplements: Ensure vitamin D dosing is appropriate; excessive dosing can raise calcium. Magnesium is fine. Avoid new herbal/supplement additions until evaluated.\n- Pancreatic enzymes: If you have oily stools, weight loss, or bloating—or persistent pain despite low-fat diet—ask about a trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement (sometimes helps pain and digestion).\n- Smoking: Avoid entirely (you don’t smoke—good).\n\nManaging flares at home and red flags\n- Mild flare: Rest the gut with clear liquids or very low-fat bland foods for 24–48 hours, aggressive oral hydration, acetaminophen or NSAIDs if you can take them.\n- Avoid tramadol and meperidine for pain (can lower seizure threshold); if you need stronger pain control, discuss safer options with your doctors.\n- Seek urgent care/ER if: severe or worsening pain >24 hours, vomiting that prevents fluids, fever, jaundice, significant abdominal swelling, shortness of breath, or new confusion.\n\nCoordination with your neurologist\n- Do not stop Keppra on your own. If there’s any suspicion it contributes, your neurologist can advise on a safe alternative and taper, balancing seizure control and pancreatitis risk.\n- Alcohol can also interfere with seizure control—another reason to avoid it.\n\nPreparing for your GI appointment\n- Bring a timeline of flares (dates, severity), associated foods/drinks/meds, lab values (lipase 70–100), and any imaging done.\n- Note any family history of pancreatitis, gallstones, cystic fibrosis, or early diabetes.\n- Ask about: RUQ ultrasound and EUS/MRCP, fasting triglycerides/calcium/PTH/IgG4, stool elastase if symptoms, genetic testing, and whether pancreatic enzyme therapy is appropriate.\n- Discuss a plan for acute flares and pain control safe for epilepsy.\n\nA few clarifying questions that can help target the workup\n- Have you had an ultrasound or MRCP/EUS yet, and do you still have your gallbladder?\n- Any family history of pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or early-onset diabetes?\n- When did you start Keppra relative to your first pancreatitis episode, and have there been dose changes?\n- What dose of vitamin D are you taking?\n- Any episodes of oily/floating stools, unintended weight loss, or low blood sugars?\n\nIf you share those details, I can help you interpret next steps and refine questions for your specialist.",
