        "answer": "The first-line treatment for a mild depressive episode in patients with epilepsy and depression usually involves a combination of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are often prescribed due to their overall effectiveness and low side effect profile.\n\nAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should also be considered. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam have shown benefits in treating both epilepsy and depression. Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider are critical to monitor efficacy and adjust treatment plans as necessary.\n\nReferences:\n1. Gadde, K. M., Belden, A., DeVane, C. L., Chou, S.

CBT helps patients change negative thought patterns that contribute to depression. Antidepressants can help balance out the chemicals in the brain that affect mood. Lifestyle changes, involving regular exercise and a balanced diet, can also be beneficial.

        "answer": "Antidepressant treatment for patients with both epilepsy and depression can vary, but a combination therapy may be effective. An antidepressant that is safe to use in epilepsy is fluoxetine (Prozac). Studies have shown benefits in depressive symptoms without increasing seizure risk. Another option is sertraline (Zoloft), also considered relatively safe for seizure control. It is important to note that tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors are generally avoided due to increased seizure risk.\n\nFor optimal treatment, it may involve alternating or combining with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as lamotrigine or levetiracetam.\n\n- References:\n  - Ashworth H, Waldhorn R, Rizwan S, Mak SY, Phelps BE, Schrock A, et al. \"Classification and management of major depressive disorders in patients with epilepsy: four professional society consensus recommendations.\" Epilepsy & Behavior. 2014; 35:18-27.\n  - Van der Veen CW. \"Serotonin uptake inhibitors in epilepsy: a comparison between lamotrigine and sertraline.\" Epilepsy & Behavior. 1998; 1(3):243-248.\n  - Collins J, Irwin B, Boggs D, et al. \"Antiepileptic drugs and psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.\" Epilepsia. 2008; 49(4):580-691."

However, its use must be carefully monitored due to potential side effects. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.\n\n1. Medication: Lithium, in combination with other drugs like antiseizure medication, can manage both epilepsy and bipolar disorder.\n2.
