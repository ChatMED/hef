        "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, here are some insights and advice that might help you manage the dizziness and disorientation you experience while gaming:\n\n## Causes of Dizziness in Gaming\n\nThe primary cause of your dizziness is likely related to the sensory conflict between what your eyes see and what your inner ear detects, a phenomenon known as simulation sickness or motion sickness from screen movement[2][4].\n\n### Sensory Conflict\nWhen playing games, especially those with intense movement like *Valorant* and *Apex Legends*, your eyes see the motion on the screen, but your inner ear does not sense the corresponding physical movement. This mismatch can lead to dizziness, nausea, and disorientation[1][4].\n\n### Visual and Vestibular Systems\nBoth the visual and vestibular systems are affected. Prolonged screen use strains the eye muscles, and the vestibular system in the inner ear gets confused by the lack of physical movement corresponding to the on-screen action[4].\n\n## Advice for Managing Symptoms\n\n### Adjust Game Settings\n- Try changing the game settings to reduce the intensity of the visual input. This can include lowering the sensitivity of the camera movements, reducing the speed of character movements, and adjusting the field of view to minimize the disparity between what your eyes see and what your inner ear detects[1].\n\n### Breaks and Rest\n- Take regular breaks every 20-30 minutes to rest your eyes and give your vestibular system a chance to recover. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: look away from the screen every 20 minutes and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds[4].\n\n### Screen Settings\n- Adjust your screen settings. High refresh-rate displays can sometimes exacerbate the issue, so consider reducing the frames-per-second or using a display with a slower refresh rate[1].\n\n### Eye Care\n- Ensure you are taking care of your eye health. Proper eye lubrication, hydration, and regular eye exams can help alleviate digital eye strain, which might be contributing to your symptoms[4].\n\n### Alternative Games\n- If the problem persists, try playing games that are less likely to cause motion sickness, such as third-person narrative games, puzzle games, or vintage 2D titles. Gradually build up your tolerance to more intense games[1].\n\n### Health and Anxiety\n- Given your anxiety and dissociation issues, it might be helpful to manage these conditions through therapy or counseling. Reducing overall stress can make you less susceptible to the physical symptoms associated with gaming[1].\n\n### Consult Your Neurologist Again\n- While your neurologists have ruled out epilepsy, it would be prudent to discuss these specific symptoms again. They may offer additional advice or refer you to a specialist in visual or vestibular disorders.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you may be able to reduce the severity of your symptoms and enjoy gaming without the discomfort of dizziness and disorientation."

        "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your experiences, it is important to consider several factors to determine whether your episodes could be related to epilepsy or another condition.\n\n### Nature of the Episodes\n- Your episodes involve sudden loss of consciousness, confusion upon awakening, and no clear recollection of the events leading up to the collapse. These symptoms are consistent with several possible causes, including seizures, but also other conditions like vasovagal syncope or other forms of syncope[3][5].\n- The presence of a heavy suppressed scream before the second episode could suggest a seizure, as seizures can sometimes be preceded by an aura or a sudden vocalization.\n\n### Investigations and Tests\n- Despite multiple tests, including ECG, X-rays, blood tests, CT scans, MRI, and EEG, no structural or functional abnormalities have been identified. This does not rule out epilepsy, as some forms of epilepsy may not show abnormalities on these tests, especially if the seizures are not frequent or if the EEG was not conducted during an active seizure period[1][2].\n\n### Prescription of Lamotrigine\n- The neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine, which is an antiepileptic medication. This suggests that the neurologist suspected seizure activity, even though the tests did not confirm it. Lamotrigine is often used to treat various types of seizures and can be prescribed prophylactically if there is a high suspicion of seizure activity.\n\n### Other Considerations\n- Your history of a head injury at age 4 could potentially be a contributing factor, although it was mentioned that there were no obvious consequences at the time.\n- The triggers for your episodes (e.g., cold water and heat, alcohol and marijuana use) could suggest other conditions like vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension, but these triggers can also precipitate seizures in some individuals[3][5].\n\n### Diagnosis\n- While the exact diagnosis is not clear from the information provided, the recurring nature of your episodes and the symptoms you described (loss of consciousness, confusion, and amnesia for the event) make it plausible that you could be experiencing some form of seizure disorder. However, without definitive EEG evidence or other diagnostic markers, the diagnosis remains tentative.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Continued monitoring and possibly a longer-term EEG or other diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm or rule out epilepsy.\n- Keeping a detailed seizure diary can help track any patterns or triggers.\n- Consultation with a neurologist for further evaluation and possible adjustment of medication is recommended.\n\nGiven the complexity of your case, it is crucial to work closely with your neurologist to determine the best course of action and to monitor for any future episodes."

Any existing relevant medical issues bone infection (being treated) chest pain after 3 epilepsy attacks within 2 weeks and every time under influence of drugs, thats what worries me.Current medications 3 types of antibiotics.  Include a photo if relevant",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the symptoms and context you've described, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Chest Pain and Epilepsy\n- Chest pain can be a rare symptom of epileptic seizures, particularly those originating from the temporal lobe. This is illustrated by cases where patients experienced chest discomfort or pain during seizures, which were confirmed through long-term video electroencephalography monitoring (LTVEM)[1].\n\n## Influence of Drugs\n- You mentioned that the chest pain occurs after epilepsy attacks and under the influence of drugs. This could indicate a few possibilities:\n  - **Drug-induced seizures**: Certain drugs, including some antibiotics, can lower the seizure threshold and provoke seizures. However, this is less common with the typical antibiotics used for bone infections[5].\n  - **Drug-induced chest pain**: Some medications, such as topiramate (an antiseizure medication), can cause chest pain as a side effect, although this is rare. In your case, it's less likely since you mentioned antibiotics rather than antiseizure medications[2].\n\n## Cardiac Effects of Seizures\n- Seizures can have cardiac effects, including arrhythmias, ST-segment changes, and in rare cases, cardiac ischemia, especially in individuals with underlying coronary artery disease. However, significant cardiac ischemia or myocardial injury is unlikely in uncomplicated seizures[4].\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n- Given the recent epilepsy attacks and the presence of chest pain, it is crucial to differentiate between cardiac and epileptic causes. Key signs that might suggest an epileptic origin include:\n  - Other ictal symptoms such as dystonic posturing, impaired awareness, and stereotyped movements.\n  - Normal cardiac angiography or other cardiac evaluations.\n  - Improvement of symptoms with antiseizure medication[1].\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Comprehensive Epilepsy Evaluation**: If not already done, a detailed epilepsy evaluation, including LTVEM, could help confirm the relationship between the seizures and the chest pain.\n- **Cardiac Evaluation**: Ensure that cardiac causes have been thoroughly ruled out through EKG, cardiac enzymes, and other relevant tests.\n- **Review Medications**: Although antibiotics are less likely to cause seizures or chest pain, reviewing the current medication regimen for any potential interactions or side effects is important.\n- **Consultation**: Consult with both a neurologist and a cardiologist to get a comprehensive view of the patient's condition and to ensure that no potential cause is missed.\n\nIn summary, while chest pain after epilepsy attacks could be related to the seizures themselves, it is essential to rule out other potential causes, including cardiac issues and medication side effects, through a thorough medical evaluation."

        "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Diagnosing epilepsy involves a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and various diagnostic tests, including the EEG and MRI. Here are some key points to clarify the process and address your concerns:\n\n## EEG and Epileptiform Activity\nAn EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain and can help identify epileptiform discharges, which are abnormal brain wave patterns associated with epilepsy. However, an EEG does not definitively diagnose epilepsy on its own. It can show abnormal brain activity, but this does not necessarily mean the person has epilepsy. Some people without epilepsy can also have irregular activity on their EEG, and conversely, some types of epilepsy may not show clear abnormalities on an EEG[2][5].\n\n## Diagnostic Criteria for Epilepsy\nEpilepsy is generally diagnosed when an individual has had two or more seizures without a clear provoking cause, or one seizure with a high risk of having more seizures. However, this is a guideline rather than a hard rule. The decision to diagnose epilepsy after a single seizure can depend on various factors, including the presence of epileptiform activity on the EEG, the type of seizure, and other risk factors identified in the medical history[1][4].\n\n## Interpretation of EEG Results\nThe presence of epileptiform discharges on an EEG can be a strong indicator of epilepsy, especially if these discharges correlate with the clinical description of the seizure. However, it is not a definitive marker. The neurologist will consider the EEG results in conjunction with the patient's medical history, seizure description, and other diagnostic tests to make a diagnosis[2][5].\n\n## Role of Other Diagnostic Tests\nIn addition to the EEG, other tests such as MRI, CT scans, and blood tests can help identify underlying causes of the seizures, such as structural brain abnormalities, infections, or metabolic disorders. An MRI, in particular, can provide detailed images of the brain structure and help identify potential causes of seizures[1][4].\n\n## Discussion with the Neurologist\nGiven the complexity of diagnosing epilepsy, it is reasonable to ask your husband's neurologist several questions:\n- What specific findings on the EEG led to the diagnosis of epilepsy after a single seizure?\n- Are there any underlying conditions or risk factors identified in his medical history that support the diagnosis?\n- How will the upcoming MRI results influence the diagnosis and treatment plan?\n- What are the implications of starting medication after a single seizure, and what are the potential side effects and benefits?\n\n## Misdiagnosis Considerations\nWhile epilepsy can be misdiagnosed, a neurologist's decision to start treatment after a single seizure is typically based on a comprehensive evaluation. However, it is crucial to ensure that all possibilities are considered. Discussing your concerns and asking for a detailed explanation of the diagnostic process can help clarify whether the diagnosis is accurate and whether other conditions have been ruled out[4].\n\nIn summary, the diagnosis of epilepsy is not solely based on a single EEG result but rather on a combination of clinical evaluation, EEG findings, and other diagnostic tests. The decision to start treatment after one seizure can be justified if there are strong indicators of a high risk for future seizures. Open communication with the neurologist is key to understanding the basis for the diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "For an individual with epilepsy who is considering donating plasma, there are several key points to consider based on the eligibility criteria and medical guidelines:\n\n## Medication and Seizure History\n- If you are currently taking antiepileptic medication, such as lamotrigine, you are generally not eligible to donate plasma. Guidelines specify that individuals with epilepsy must not be taking medications related to their diagnosis to be considered for plasma donation[4].\n\n## Seizure-Free Period\n- To be eligible, you typically need to have been seizure-free for a certain period, often three years. Since your last seizure was in April 2021, you do not meet this criterion[2][4].\n\n## Health and Safety Concerns\n- There is a concern about the risk of adverse reactions, such as faints or epileptiform convulsions, especially if the donor experiences syncope (fainting) during or after donation. However, studies suggest that individuals with a history of seizures or epilepsy are not at a significantly greater risk for adverse reactions after blood donation[5].\n\n## Specific Donor Center Policies\n- Different plasma donation centers may have varying policies. Some may allow individuals with a history of epilepsy to donate if they meet specific criteria, such as being seizure-free for a certain period and not taking antiepileptic medications. However, others may have stricter rules and defer or disqualify individuals with controlled epilepsy to ensure safety and compliance with regulations[2][4].\n\nGiven your current medication regimen and recent seizure history, it is likely that you would be deferred or disqualified from donating plasma at most donation centers. The primary reasons are the ongoing use of antiepileptic medication and the recent occurrence of a seizure, which do not align with the eligibility criteria set by plasma donation guidelines."

        "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I\u2019ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I\u2019m seeing that I haven\u2019t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I\u2019m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I\u2019d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it\u2019s important to me to know when it\u2019s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of temporal lobe epilepsy and the surgical intervention you underwent, it is important to consider several factors when determining the relevance of your history to your current health.\n\n## Long-Term Impact of Epilepsy and Surgery\n- Studies indicate that refractory temporal lobe epilepsy can lead to cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral issues due to the repetitive nature of the seizures and their impact on brain function[1][5].\n- However, since you had surgery at a relatively young age (around 10 years old) and have been seizure-free since, the long-term cognitive and behavioral impacts may be less severe compared to those who experience prolonged durations of refractory epilepsy[2][5].\n\n## Current Health Relevance\n- Even though you have not had seizures since your surgery, your history of epilepsy can still be relevant in several contexts:\n  - **Medical Evaluations:** Disclosing your history is crucial for any medical professional to have a complete understanding of your health profile. It can influence decisions on medications, especially those that might lower the seizure threshold, and other treatments.\n  - **Driving and Licensing:** As you experienced, having a history of seizures can impact your driving privileges. Many jurisdictions require a certain period of seizure freedom before reinstating a driver's license, and a doctor's note may be necessary to clear you for driving[2].\n  - **Insurance and Employment:** In some cases, a history of epilepsy might be relevant for insurance purposes or certain occupations that require specific medical clearances.\n\n## When to Disclose\n- It is generally advisable to disclose your history of epilepsy in any medical context, especially when filling out comprehensive health questionnaires. This ensures that healthcare providers are aware of any potential risks or complications related to your medical history.\n- For non-medical contexts, such as employment or insurance, you should follow the specific guidelines and requirements of the entity requesting the information.\n\nIn summary, while your surgery has likely mitigated many of the long-term effects of temporal lobe epilepsy, it is still important to be honest about your medical history to ensure comprehensive care and to comply with various regulations and requirements."

        "question": "27 years old male Non smoker 73 kg 180 cm No other chronic illnessFor the past decade, I've been dealing with two distinct issues.- The first involves zigzag flashes across my field of vision, which are then followed by a mild headache lasting about an hour.- The second is an abrupt sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or dream recall that leaves me feeling anxious and uncertain about my own memories.Both of these \"auras\" typically last around 20 minutes. I haven't sought treatment yet since these episodes occur infrequently\u2014sometimes just once a year or once every few months.I'm unsure if what I'm experiencing is related to epilepsy or migraines?If anyone has had similar experiences, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms, it is important to consider both migraines and epilepsy, as they can present with similar auras and overlapping symptoms.\n\n## Visual Auras and Headaches\n- The zigzag flashes across your field of vision followed by a mild headache are characteristic of a migraine aura, particularly a visual aura. This type of aura can include symptoms like fortification spectra (zigzag patterns), scotomas, or other visual disturbances, which are then followed by a headache[3][4].\n\n## D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and Anxiety\n- The abrupt sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or dream recall, accompanied by anxiety, could be related to either migraines or another condition. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can be a symptom of both migraine auras and epileptic auras, although the context and duration can help differentiate between the two. Migraine auras typically have a slow, gradual onset and can last up to 1 hour, which aligns with your described duration of 20 minutes[4].\n\n## Differentiation\n- **Migraine Auras**: These often have a gradual onset and can last up to 1 hour. The visual symptoms usually start in the center of the visual field and move towards the periphery. Migraines are more common and can be triggered by various factors such as stress, changes in sleep patterns, and certain foods or substances[1][4].\n- **Epileptic Auras**: These typically have a sudden onset and last less than 5 minutes. Epileptic auras can include a wider range of symptoms, such as hearing strange sounds, changes in taste, or sudden surges of emotions. However, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is more commonly associated with temporal lobe seizures in epilepsy[4].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven the infrequency but distinct nature of your episodes, it would be prudent to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist, to determine the exact cause. Here are some points to consider:\n- **Neurological Examination**: A thorough neurological examination, including an electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can help differentiate between migraines and epilepsy.\n- **Symptom Tracking**: Keeping a detailed log of your symptoms, including triggers and the exact nature of your auras, can provide valuable information for your healthcare provider.\n- **Comorbid Conditions**: Since both migraines and epilepsy can coexist and share similar symptoms, it is important to rule out both conditions and address any underlying factors that might be contributing to your symptoms[1][4].\n\nIn summary, while your symptoms could be indicative of migraines, especially given the visual auras and headaches, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional to rule out epilepsy and to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The behaviors your partner is experiencing could be indicative of several possible conditions, but given the descriptions, here are a few potential explanations:\n\n## Functional or Dissociative Seizures\nThese seizures, also known as non-epileptic seizures, can manifest as physical reactions to emotional or psychological stress. They are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain but by an unconscious response to stress or traumatic events. The behaviors described, such as tense facial expressions, vibrating body, and loss of awareness, could be consistent with functional seizures. These seizures often lack a clear trigger but can be exacerbated by stressful or intense situations[1].\n\n## Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness\nFocal seizures, particularly those with impaired awareness, can cause changes in behavior, facial expressions, and bodily movements. However, these seizures typically involve more localized brain activity and may include specific auras or post-seizure symptoms that are not mentioned in your description. Focal seizures can cause repetitive movements, changes in facial expressions, and loss of awareness, but they usually have a more defined onset and offset compared to what you described[2][5].\n\n## Other Possible Explanations\n- **Tics or Movement Disorders**: The repetitive and expressive facial movements, along with the body vibrations, could also suggest a movement disorder such as a tic disorder (e.g., Tourette syndrome). However, tics are usually more predictable and not typically associated with the same level of loss of awareness described.\n- **Anxiety or Stress Response**: The behaviors could be an exaggerated response to stress or anxiety, particularly given the triggers mentioned (e.g., intense scenes or completion of tasks). However, this would not fully explain the lack of awareness during these episodes.\n\n### Recommendations\nGiven the complexity and potential psychological or neurological origins of these behaviors, it is crucial for your partner to consult a healthcare professional. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation**: A thorough medical history, physical examination, and potentially some diagnostic tests (e.g., EEG, psychological assessments) would be necessary to differentiate between various possible causes.\n2. **Psychological Evaluation**: Since functional seizures often have a psychological component, a consultation with a psychologist or psychiatrist could be helpful in identifying any underlying trauma or stressors.\n3. **Observation and Documentation**: Keeping a detailed log of when these episodes occur, what triggers them, and how long they last can provide valuable information for healthcare providers.\n\nUnderstanding the exact cause will help in developing an appropriate treatment plan, which could include therapy, stress management techniques, or in some cases, medication."

I do have my rescue medication (generic Ativan) which I have never had to take before. should I take this every 12 hours like I do my keppra?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "If you have run out of your Keppra (levetiracetam) and are unable to get a new prescription until Monday, here are some guidelines to consider:\n\n## Keppra Missed Doses\nMissing a dose of Keppra can potentially increase the risk of having a seizure, although for most people, a single missed dose is unlikely to trigger one immediately. If you miss a dose, it is recommended to take it as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time of your next scheduled dose. Do not double the dose[3].\n\n## Ativan as Rescue Medication\nAtivan (lorazepam) is typically used as a rescue medication for acute seizure management, not as a regular maintenance medication like Keppra. Here are some key points about using Ativan:\n\n- **Dosage**: Ativan is usually administered in specific situations, such as during an ongoing seizure. The typical dosage for seizure treatment is 4 mg given slowly over about 2 minutes, with the option for another 4-mg dose if the seizure continues after 10-15 minutes[2][5].\n- **Not for Regular Use**: Ativan should not be taken every 12 hours like your Keppra. It is meant to be used only in emergency situations to stop an active seizure.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Contact Your Healthcare Provider**: Reach out to your healthcare provider for guidance on managing your medication gap.\n- **Take Missed Keppra Doses**: Follow the guidelines for taking missed doses of Keppra as mentioned above.\n- **Use Ativan Only in Emergency**: Use Ativan only if you experience a seizure and need immediate intervention.\n\nIt is crucial to get your Keppra prescription refilled as soon as possible to maintain your regular seizure management regimen. If you experience any seizures or concerning symptoms before you can get your prescription, seek medical attention promptly."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Nocturnal seizures, which occur during sleep, are influenced by several factors that make them more likely to happen when you are tired or asleep rather than when you are alert and awake. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Sleep Stage and Brain Activity\nNocturnal seizures often occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is characterized by different brain electrical activity compared to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or wakefulness. During NREM sleep, the brain's electrical signals can become more disorganized, increasing the likelihood of seizures[1][4].\n\n## Increased Vulnerability During Sleep\nSleep can act as a \"window of vulnerability\" for individuals with epilepsy. The changes in brain activity, respiratory patterns, and other physiological processes during sleep can make it more conducive for seizures to occur. For example, sleep is associated with lower oxygen saturation levels and increased upper airway resistance, which can contribute to more severe hypoxemia during nocturnal seizures[4].\n\n## Specific Types of Epilepsy\nCertain types of epilepsy, such as sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) or nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, are more likely to cause seizures during sleep. These conditions typically involve seizures that start in the frontal lobe of the brain and are more common during nighttime sleep or even daytime naps[1].\n\n## Triggers and Underlying Causes\nWhile some seizures can be unprovoked, others are triggered by specific factors. However, in many cases of nocturnal seizures, there may not be an immediately identifiable trigger. Factors that can contribute to the development of seizures, including nocturnal ones, include head injuries, infections, brain inflammation, stroke, brain tumors, and genetic predispositions. Even though these factors do not specifically target sleep, the brain's state during sleep may make it more susceptible to seizure activity[1][3].\n\n## Autonomic Nervous System\nChanges in the autonomic nervous system during sleep can also play a role. For instance, the transition from wakefulness to sleep involves shifts in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, which could influence seizure susceptibility. However, these changes are more typically associated with fatigue and stress responses rather than directly causing seizures[2].\n\nIn summary, the combination of specific sleep stages, increased vulnerability during sleep, and the underlying mechanisms of certain types of epilepsy make it more likely for seizures to occur when you are tired or asleep rather than when you are alert and awake."

        "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out. I was also having some breakthrough seizures in my sleep.Current meds: escitalopram 15mg q24 (recent increase) lacosamide 200mg q12 gabapentin 400mg q8-12 buspirone 5mg q12 (new) tizanidine 2-4mg before bed celecoxib 100mg q12-24 Vyvanse 30mg as needed (which I did quit for a while to see if it was the culprit.

        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the recent traumatic experience, it's crucial to address several aspects of your care.\n\n## Seizure Management\nThe incident where you experienced a cluster of seizures due to the anesthesiologist's decision to use propofol, despite your known sensitivity, highlights the importance of adhering to your neurologist's medication protocols. Lorazepam, as recommended by your neurologist, is often effective in managing acute seizures, including those in patients with epilepsy. Studies have shown that sublingual lorazepam can be an effective rescue therapy for prolonged and repetitive seizures, with high patient satisfaction and no serious adverse events at doses of 0.5 to 2 mg[1][3].\n\n## Mental Health and Trauma\nYour symptoms of constant panic, exhaustion, aggression, mood swings, and sleep disturbances suggest a significant impact on your mental health following the traumatic event. Given your history of Chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD), anxiety, and depression, it is important to work closely with your new mental health facility to develop a comprehensive treatment plan. This may include therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-focused therapies, along with pharmacological management.\n\n## Current Medications and Adjustments\n- **Escitalopram**: The recent increase might be contributing to some of your symptoms, so monitoring its effects is important.\n- **Lacosamide, Gabapentin**: These are antiepileptic medications that also have anxiolytic properties but may need adjustment based on your current seizure control and side effects.\n- **Buspirone**: New addition for anxiety, which may take some time to show effects.\n- **Tizanidine**: Used for muscle relaxation and sleep; its effects should be monitored.\n- **Celecoxib**: For pain management, but ensure it's not contributing to any of your current symptoms.\n\n## Considerations for Future Care\n- **Emergency Seizure Protocol**: Ensure that all healthcare providers have access to your specific medication protocols and emergency seizure management plan.\n- **Mental Health Support**: Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) or inpatient hospitalization may be necessary to stabilize your mental health and address the trauma you've experienced.\n- **Sleep Disturbances**: Addressing sleep issues through a combination of behavioral therapy and possibly additional medications like melatonin or other sleep aids might be helpful.\n- **Communication with Healthcare Providers**: It is crucial to maintain open and clear communication with your healthcare providers, ensuring they understand the full scope of your condition and the impact of the recent incident.\n\n## Reporting and Advocacy\nSince you have already reported the anesthesiologist, continuing to advocate for yourself and ensuring that your medical records reflect the incident and its aftermath will be important in future care.\n\nGiven the complexity of your situation, a multidisciplinary approach involving your neurologist, mental health providers, and possibly a psychiatrist would be beneficial to manage both your seizure disorder and mental health issues effectively."

        "question": "I have 2 conditions(?) i want to mention, the second being (in my opinion) more severe than the first.the first is something ive noticed more recently. im not sure how long its been going on. i got an apple watch in december, which is the first heart rate tracking device ive owned. ive been using it to occasionally measure my heartrate, and ive noticed that my resting heart rate lies anywhere from 20-50 or 60 bpm lower than my standing heart rate. for a while, immediately upon standing i would become dizzy and my vision would fade a little, and i would see spots. this usually clears up after around 10 seconds 20 seconds at the most. ive seen a lot of resources about pots but i dont and have never fainted or started sweating due to standing the second is something i can give a lot more details on. ive been calling these \"blackouts\" but thats not medically accurate. it usually starts with me feeling unusually sick for a bit, then suddenly, the sickness symptoms will instantly disappear and my hearing will muffle greatly, and my ears will start ringing, but the ringing is also muffled. then, my field of vision will begin to tunnel, gradually getting smaller and smaller, until it becomes completely black, at which point i lose all recollection of what im doing, im basically acting without being conscious.these started when i was 8 and have happened every few years or so since, with them gradually getting worse and worse. the first time it happened, it was just slight lightheadedness and nausea, then muffled hearing and my vision partially tunneling, but not going all the way. this more recent time a little less than 2 years ago, however, i felt extremely nauseous, i felt extremely cold yet i was sweating profusely, i think i might have had a headache too i cant fully remember. i felt like i was gonna die before the \"blackout\" even started and the muffled hearing started. when i fully blacked out and lost consciousness (while still controlling my body, like a zombie in a sense), i have no idea how long i was out for, and i only was brought back to reality when i felt water hit my foot after i knocked over a pitcher.ive done a lot of research on this specifically and the closest thing ive found has been transient ischemic attacks. im not fully sure if this is a tia though, especially because i cant recall weakness in one side of my body at any time during one of these, but that might be because my memory during these events isnt really the best. additionally, my moms biological mom had several strokes before dying of another stroke, which could make me more predisposed to strokes, but again im not entirely sure. ive also gotten results for certain types of epilepsy, but i never looked too deep into them so that may not be validthe reason i bring these two afflictions up together is because maybe im missing something? maybe these are both signs of a rare illness or something? maybe theyre two different things that are co morbid? they may have nothing to do with each other at all though, i just want to include anything i can think of some other things i have are a heat sensitivity (not sure if this is the correct term, but basically i just get really really hot for no reason and cant cool off until i put cold water on my body), as well as sweating a lot, like ill be cold and still sweating. not sure if these have anything to do with the above but im adding it here just in case.if you have any questions feel free to ask, theres something i may have forgotten to add here. also im sorry about the length, i have a tendency to explain things with a lot more words than are needed",

        "answer": "Given the symptoms you've described, it's important to consider several potential conditions and their interrelations. Here are some insights based on your descriptions:\n\n### First Condition: Heart Rate and Dizziness Upon Standing\n\n- The symptoms you describe, such as a significant increase in heart rate upon standing, dizziness, and temporary vision disturbances, are suggestive of **Orthostatic Intolerance (OI)**. This condition is characterized by symptoms that occur when standing upright and are relieved when reclining. The rapid heart rate increase and temporary dizziness are common in OI, particularly in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), which is a form of OI[2][4].\n- Your Apple Watch data showing a marked difference between resting and standing heart rates further supports this possibility.\n\n### Second Condition: \"Blackouts\" with Muffled Hearing and Vision Tunneling\n\n- The episodes of feeling extremely sick, followed by muffled hearing, ringing ears, and a tunneling vision that leads to a complete loss of consciousness, are more complex and could have several potential causes.\n  - **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs)**: While TIAs are a possibility, they typically involve focal neurological deficits such as weakness on one side of the body, which you mentioned you cannot recall. However, it's crucial to rule out TIAs given your family history of strokes[2].\n  - **Seizures or Epilepsy**: The loss of consciousness and the nature of the symptoms you describe could also suggest a seizure disorder. Seizures can cause a range of symptoms including auditory and visual disturbances, and the loss of consciousness without any memory of the event.\n  - **Other Conditions**: Other possibilities include vasovagal syncope, which can cause similar symptoms, or even a condition like mitochondrial cytopathy, which can lead to a variety of systemic symptoms including those related to autonomic dysfunction[2].\n\n### Heat Sensitivity and Excessive Sweating\n\n- These symptoms can be associated with various conditions, including autonomic nervous system disorders (such as POTS), anxiety disorders, or even some metabolic conditions. They may be related to your primary symptoms or could be independent.\n\n### Potential Connections and Recommendations\n\n- **Orthostatic Intolerance and Other Conditions**: It is possible that both conditions are related to an underlying autonomic nervous system disorder. Orthostatic intolerance can sometimes co-exist with other conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or even mitochondrial cytopathies[2][4].\n- **Medical Evaluation**: Given the complexity and severity of your symptoms, it is essential to seek a comprehensive medical evaluation.\n  - You should consult a cardiologist to evaluate your heart rate and orthostatic intolerance symptoms.\n  - A neurologist can help assess the possibility of seizures or other neurological conditions.\n  - Additional testing such as tilt table tests, ECG, EEG, and possibly imaging studies may be necessary to determine the underlying causes.\n\n### Summary\n\nYour symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of Orthostatic Intolerance, possibly POTS, for the first condition. The second condition, involving \"blackouts\" and sensory disturbances, could be related to several neurological or cardiovascular conditions and requires a thorough medical investigation. Heat sensitivity and excessive sweating may be related to these conditions or could be independent symptoms that need evaluation. A multidisciplinary medical approach will help in accurately diagnosing and managing your symptoms."

        "question": "18M 72kg/160lbs 180cm healthy non-smoker and non-drinker. My blood pressure normally around 55/110 and my mother has epilepsy. I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the description of your experience, it is important to consider several factors to determine whether it might have been an epileptic seizure or another condition.\n\n### Key Points from Your Description:\n- You hyperventilated, stood up, and passed out.\n- You had a brief dream during the episode.\n- Your friend observed you swinging your right leg and scraping the carpet with your right hand for about 10 seconds.\n- You remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds.\n- You are feeling a little foggy afterward.\n\n### Possible Explanations:\n\n#### Epileptic Seizure:\n- The repetitive movements (leg swinging and hand scraping) could be indicative of a focal seizure, particularly if they were involuntary and part of an automatism (repetitive, unconscious movements)[3][5].\n- However, the trigger of hyperventilation and the brief duration of the episode might suggest other causes as well.\n- If you have a family history of epilepsy (your mother has epilepsy), this could increase your risk, but it is not conclusive on its own.\n\n#### Other Conditions:\n- **Syncope**: Fainting due to hyperventilation is a common cause of brief loss of consciousness. Hyperventilation can lead to a drop in blood carbon dioxide levels, which can cause dizziness and fainting. The brief dream could be a result of the reduced blood flow to the brain[2].\n- **Anxiety or Panic Attack**: Hyperventilation is often associated with anxiety or panic attacks, which can lead to lightheadedness and fainting.\n- **Orthostatic Hypotension**: Standing up quickly can cause a temporary drop in blood pressure, leading to fainting.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the complexity and the need for an accurate diagnosis, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Here are some steps to take:\n\n1. **Seek Medical Attention**: Visit your primary care physician or a neurologist to get a thorough evaluation. They will assess your symptoms, medical history, and possibly conduct tests such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to determine the cause of the episode[2][4].\n\n2. **Provide Detailed Information**: Share all the details of your episode, including the hyperventilation, the movements observed by your friend, and any other symptoms you experienced.\n\n3. **Monitor for Future Episodes**: Keep a record of any further episodes, including any warning signs or symptoms, to help in the diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, while the episode has some characteristics that could suggest a seizure, it is also possible that it was due to another condition such as syncope or an anxiety-related event. A medical professional is the best person to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment."

        "question": "Female, 47, 65kg, 1.62cm, no other medicine or illness until thus far. No smoke, drinking, children or cases in the family.Up until I was 7 I took Gardenal. Then stopped - and my late granduncle was the top pediatric neurologist in the country - and did EEGs yearly until about 25.Had deja-vus up until college, never thought they could be considered related to epilepsy.When I was 45, epidemic, worst job in the world. Colleagues were in Rio, London, Lagos and Dubai. My sleep pattern went haywire, and I turned to Zolpidem to give me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Started at 5mg. As pressure grew, isolation, trouble in the job, slowly I grew the dosage. Had a burnout, left the job, and now I was taking 500mg to 600mg a day. Yes, 2 to 3 boxes. A day. I was floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid.Then I started having tonic-clonics. 8 in few months. I was deeply scared and built a team of therapist, psychologist and neurologist. Good news, nothing physical in the brain. Other good news is that I quit Zolpidem cold turkey, had withdrawal, suffered a lot... But quit.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The scenario you describe is consistent with several reports of zolpidem abuse, dependence, and severe withdrawal symptoms, particularly at high doses.\n\n## Key Points\n\n### High-Dose Zolpidem Abuse\n- You started with a therapeutic dose of 5mg of zolpidem but gradually increased it to 500-600mg per day due to increasing stress and sleep disturbances. This escalation is a common pattern in cases of zolpidem abuse, where patients develop tolerance and psychological dependence[2][4][5].\n\n### Withdrawal Symptoms and Seizures\n- The sudden cessation of high-dose zolpidem can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures. Your experience of having tonic-clonic seizures after taking high doses of zolpidem aligns with several case reports that describe similar withdrawal symptoms[1][2][5].\n- Seizures, particularly generalized tonic-clonic seizures, are a recognized complication of zolpidem withdrawal, especially when the drug is discontinued abruptly after long-term use at high doses[1][2][5].\n\n### Management and Treatment\n- The use of benzodiazepines (such as diazepam, lorazepam, or clonazepam) and anticonvulsants (like phenytoin) is often recommended to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent seizures[1][2][5].\n- Gradual dose tapering and shifting to long-acting benzodiazepines can help in managing the withdrawal process and reducing the risk of severe symptoms[3][5].\n\n### Psychological and Physical Impact\n- High-dose zolpidem use can lead to a range of adverse effects, including hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and significant cognitive and physical impairment. Your description of feeling \"floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid\" is consistent with the reported effects of high-dose zolpidem abuse[1][4].\n\n### Recovery\n- It is crucial to have a multidisciplinary team, including therapists, psychologists, and neurologists, to support recovery from zolpidem dependence. The fact that you quit zolpidem cold turkey and suffered through withdrawal but ultimately quit is a positive step, although it is generally recommended to taper off the medication under medical supervision to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms[3][5].\n\nGiven your history and the severity of your symptoms, it is important to continue monitoring your health and seeking professional help to manage any ongoing issues related to the withdrawal and to prevent future complications."

        "question": "I (30F) had a seizure for the first time 3 days ago. I had had a couple beers, smoked a joint, and did some shrooms (none of which is unusual for me). I have no family history of epilepsy, and am in generally good health.I was checked out by paramedics immediately after the seizure who said I looked fine and it was probably from the shrooms. I went to my PCP the next day and she ordered a couple blood tests which all came back normal. I am waiting for brain imaging to be approved by my insurance.Now it\u2019s three days later and I still feel exhausted and weak and slow. I could barely get through my workday today. Is this normal? Is extreme fatigue indicative of something?Also I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant at all but about a month ago I started experiencing extreme nausea to the point I was calling off sick at work, vomiting in the middle of the day, and had just had a doctors appointment to discuss that the week before.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Experiencing extreme fatigue, weakness, and slowness after a seizure is not uncommon, especially given your recent experience. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Postictal Phase\nThe period immediately after a seizure, known as the postictal phase, can last from a few minutes to several hours or even days. During this time, it is common to feel exhausted, confused, and experience other symptoms such as headaches, mood changes, and difficulty with speech and coordination[1][4][5].\n\n## Recovery Time\nFull recovery from a seizure can take several hours to several days. It is normal for people to feel tired, sleepy, and disoriented during this period. The duration and severity of these symptoms can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the seizure, as well as individual factors[1][4][5].\n\n## Potential Causes of Fatigue\n- **Seizure Type and Severity**: The type and severity of the seizure can influence the duration and intensity of postictal symptoms, including fatigue.\n- **Substance Use**: While the paramedics suggested the seizure might be related to the use of shrooms, it is important to note that substance use can sometimes trigger seizures, but it does not necessarily explain the ongoing fatigue. However, substances like marijuana can have complex effects on the brain and may contribute to or exacerbate fatigue[3].\n- **Underlying Health Issues**: Your recent history of extreme nausea and vomiting could be a separate health issue that is contributing to your fatigue. It is crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions that might be affecting you.\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven your ongoing symptoms and the recent history of nausea and vomiting, it is important to:\n- **Follow Up on Brain Imaging**: The brain imaging tests ordered by your PCP can help determine if there is any structural issue in the brain that could be causing the seizures.\n- **Discuss All Symptoms**: Inform your healthcare provider about all your symptoms, including the recent nausea and vomiting, to get a comprehensive understanding of your health.\n- **Avoid Strenuous Activities**: Continue to take it easy and avoid strenuous mental or physical activities until you feel better. Engage in relaxing activities and try to maintain a regular sleep routine to help manage your fatigue[1][2][4].\n\n## Seek Medical Advice\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you experience another seizure, it is crucial to seek immediate medical advice. Additionally, any signs of postictal psychosis or Todd\u2019s paresis (postictal paralysis) should be addressed promptly with your healthcare provider[1][4][5].\n\nIn summary, while your fatigue and weakness are likely part of the postictal recovery, it is important to ensure there are no underlying health issues that need to be addressed. Continuing to monitor your symptoms and following up with your healthcare provider will help in determining the best course of action."

I will get an overwhelming sensation of doom/panic. My body basically forgets how to breathe. Heart rate goes up. My brain feels weird, dizzy, and fuzzy. I get hot and nauseous. I just don\u2019t feel ok, something in my head just feels very off and I\u2019m scared. These episodes last for a few seconds to a few minutes. I don\u2019t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it\u2019s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It\u2019s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn\u2019t the same feeling. I\u2019ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn\u2019t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing are complex and could be indicative of several potential conditions. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Light Sensitivity and Other Symptoms\nYour sensitivity to light, accompanied by feelings of doom, panic, increased heart rate, dizziness, fuzziness in the brain, and nausea, could be related to several conditions. Photophobia (sensitivity to light) can be a symptom of various issues, including migraines, neurological conditions, or even certain medications[3].\n\n## Neurological Symptoms\nThe episodes of feeling like your body forgets how to breathe, the weird sensation in your head, and the muscle twitches below your lip and chin area, suggest there might be a neurological component. These symptoms, along with short-term memory issues, difficulty with reading out loud, and the peculiar sensation of your eyes and brain feeling like they are shaking, need thorough evaluation.\n\n## Focal Seizure/Epilepsy\nWhile your symptoms are alarming and could be suggestive of seizures, they do not perfectly align with typical focal seizures or epilepsy. In focal seizures, there is often a loss of awareness or specific motor symptoms that are more localized. However, your ability to speak during the episodes and the lack of loss of consciousness make this less likely, although it is still a possibility that needs to be ruled out by a specialist[1].\n\n## Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)\nSome of your symptoms, such as the muscle twitches, sudden falls or drops (though you mentioned you don't lose consciousness), and the varied neurological symptoms without a clear physical cause, could be indicative of a Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). FNDs are characterized by neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by other medical conditions and are often related to how the nervous system functions rather than actual damage to the brain[1].\n\n## Medication Effects\nThe medications you are taking, particularly trazodone, could be exacerbating or contributing to some of these symptoms. Trazodone can sometimes cause dizziness, headaches, and other neurological side effects, so it is worth discussing these symptoms with your healthcare provider to see if adjusting your medication regimen might help.\n\n## Other Considerations\n- **Tinnitus and Eye Floaters**: These symptoms can be associated with various conditions, including inner ear disorders or other neurological issues[2][5].\n- **Headaches and Memory Issues**: These could be related to several factors, including stress, medication side effects, or underlying neurological conditions[4].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven the complexity and variety of your symptoms, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider, preferably a neurologist, for a comprehensive evaluation. They may recommend tests such as EEGs, MRIs, or other diagnostic tools to rule out conditions like epilepsy, FND, or other neurological disorders. Additionally, a review of your medications and potential adjustments may be necessary to see if that alleviates any of the symptoms."

My question is why would he describe the EEG as \u2018essentially normal\u2019 rather than just normal?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The description of an EEG as \"essentially normal\" rather than simply \"normal\" can indicate several nuances in the interpretation of the results, especially in the context of diagnosing epilepsy. Here are some reasons why a neurologist might use this terminology:\n\n## Presence of Minor Irregularities\nEven though the EEG might not show clear epileptiform activity (abnormal brain wave patterns typical of epilepsy), there could be minor irregularities or variations in brain activity that are not definitive but still noteworthy. These minor irregularities might not be significant enough to confirm epilepsy but could suggest that the brain activity is not entirely typical[1][3][5].\n\n## Limitations of EEG Testing\nAn EEG only records brain activity during the time of the test and may not capture seizure activity if it does not occur during the testing period. The neurologist might be acknowledging that the EEG was normal during the test but leaving open the possibility that seizures could occur at other times, which aligns with the clinical suspicion of epilepsy despite the normal EEG result[1][2][5].\n\n## Clinical Context\nThe description \"essentially normal\" could be a way to reconcile the EEG findings with the clinical presentation. If the patient's symptoms and medical history strongly suggest epilepsy, but the EEG does not show clear evidence, the neurologist might use this phrase to indicate that while the EEG is not abnormal, it does not rule out epilepsy. This is particularly relevant in cases where the diagnosis is difficult, as mentioned in your scenario[2][4].\n\n## Need for Further Evaluation\nThe phrase \"essentially normal\" might also imply that further testing or monitoring is needed. Given that your nocturnal and daytime episodes continue despite medication, the neurologist may be suggesting that additional diagnostic tools, such as ambulatory EEG, high-density EEG, or other imaging and testing, could be necessary to fully understand and diagnose the condition[1][3][5].\n\nIn your case, the combination of clinical symptoms and the lack of definitive evidence on the EEG leads the neurologist to describe the EEG as \"essentially normal,\" indicating a need for ongoing evaluation and possibly more specialized testing to confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy."

        "answer": "The restrictions on blood and plasma donation for individuals with epilepsy are based on several considerations, although the primary concerns do not appear to be entirely justified by recent studies.\n\n## Risk of Seizures During Donation\nOne of the main reasons for excluding individuals with epilepsy from donating blood or plasma is the concern that the donation process could trigger a seizure. The physical stress and potential hypovolemia (reduced blood volume) during donation might increase the risk of a seizure, particularly if the individual has a recent history of seizures[2][5].\n\n## Medication Concerns\nThere is also a historical concern that medications used to treat epilepsy could potentially have adverse effects on the recipient of the blood or plasma. However, this concern is not strongly supported by evidence, as studies have shown that individuals with epilepsy do not pose a greater risk for adverse reactions in the recipient[3].\n\n## Current Guidelines\n- In the UK, the guidelines generally state that individuals requiring treatment for epilepsy or who have had an epileptic episode in the last three years are not eligible to donate blood or plasma. However, if a person with a past history of epilepsy has been seizure-free and off anticonvulsant therapy for at least three years, they may be accepted as donors[1][2].\n- Some centers may have different time frames or requirements, but the common theme is a period of seizure freedom and often being medication-free for a specified period[2][5].\n\n## Recent Studies\nStudies have indicated that individuals with epilepsy are not at a significantly greater risk for adverse reactions during or after blood donation compared to healthy donors. For example, a study by the American Red Cross found that donors with a history of seizures had a low incidence of adverse reactions, and the risk of syncope or convulsive syncope was not significantly increased[3].\n\nIn summary, the restrictions are primarily due to caution regarding potential seizures during the donation process and historical concerns about medication effects, although recent evidence suggests these risks may be overstated. If you have been seizure-free and off medication for the required period, you might be eligible to donate, but this would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the donation center."

        "question": "My friend is 19 and pregnant. She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your friend's symptoms and medical history, here are several key points and potential explanations to consider:\n\n## Seizures During Pregnancy\nSeizures during pregnancy can be caused by various factors, including pre-existing epilepsy, new onset seizures, and pregnancy-related conditions. Since your friend does not have a history of epilepsy or seizures, the focus should be on new onset seizures and other pregnancy-related causes[1][4].\n\n## Low Magnesium Levels\nLow magnesium levels can contribute to a range of symptoms during pregnancy, including muscle cramps, fatigue, irritability, and sleep disturbances. Magnesium deficiency has also been linked to more severe conditions such as preeclampsia, premature labor, and gestational diabetes. The fact that your friend's blood tests showed low magnesium levels is significant, as magnesium plays a crucial role in nervous system function and could potentially contribute to her symptoms[2][5].\n\n## Other Potential Causes\nDespite the low magnesium levels, other underlying conditions need to be ruled out, especially given the history of sepsis in the previous pregnancy and the current symptoms. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n- **Structural and Metabolic Changes**: Conditions such as intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or metabolic disorders (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria) could precipitate new-onset seizures during pregnancy[1][4].\n- **Eclampsia**: Although this is typically associated with pre-eclampsia, it is a critical condition to consider, especially if your friend shows signs of high blood pressure or other related symptoms[1][4].\n- **Other Health Issues**: Infections, hyperemesis gravidarum, or other metabolic conditions could also be contributing factors.\n\n## Symptoms and Diagnosis\nThe symptoms your friend is experiencing, such as amnesia, confusion, and dizziness followed by seizures, are not typical of classical seizures but could indicate other neurological or metabolic issues. The lack of pain during the episodes but pain afterwards suggests a complex condition that may not be straightforward seizures.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation**: Your friend needs a thorough medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms. This should include neurological assessments, imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scans), and further blood tests to rule out other metabolic or structural causes.\n- **Magnesium Supplementation**: Given the low magnesium levels, supplementation with magnesium citrate or another well-absorbed form of magnesium could help alleviate some symptoms. However, this should be under medical supervision to ensure it does not mask other underlying issues[2][5].\n- **Close Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of her condition, including oxygen saturation levels and other vital signs, is crucial to ensure her safety and the health of the fetus.\n- **Multidisciplinary Care**: Collaboration between obstetricians, neurologists, and other specialists may be necessary to manage her condition effectively.\n\nEncourage your friend to follow up with her healthcare providers for a detailed diagnosis and appropriate management plan."

        "question": "22F, 110 poundsCurrent Medications- Lamictal 200 mg in the AM & PM so 400mg total a day. Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering the combination of Lamictal (lamotrigine) and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) in your specific situation, here are some key points to note:\n\n## Effects and Risks of Combining Lamictal and Vyvanse\n\n- Combining Lamictal and Vyvanse can increase the intensity of the side effects associated with Vyvanse. These side effects may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, vomiting, upset stomach, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, loss of coordination, blurred vision, difficulty speaking, loss of appetite, and back or joint pain[1][3|.\n- There is a risk of overdose, which can be life-threatening, especially if high doses of both medications are taken together[1|.\n- Vyvanse is a controlled substance with potential for addiction, and combining it with other medications can increase this risk[1].\n\n## Specific Considerations for Your Condition\n\n- **Seizures and Lamictal**: Lamictal is used as an anticonvulsant to prevent and control seizures. If you have a history of grand mal seizures and a brain lesion, it is crucial to adhere to your prescribed dosage of Lamictal to manage your seizures. Missing doses can lead to an increased frequency of seizures, as you have observed[1|.\n- **Lesion in the Brain**: The apparent reduction in the size of the lesion observed in your newer MRI could be due to various factors, including the resolution of the imaging technique or changes in the lesion itself. However, even if the lesion appears smaller, it does not necessarily mean that your seizures will stop. Seizures can still occur if the underlying neurological issue is not fully resolved or if the medication is not taken as prescribed[1].\n\n## Other Factors\n\n- **Medical Marijuana**: While there are no specific interactions reported between medical marijuana and Vyvanse or Lamictal, it is always best to inform your healthcare provider about any substances you use, including cannabis products[3|.\n- **Alcohol Consumption**: Given your minimal alcohol consumption, it is unlikely to be a significant factor in your medication interactions[5].\n\n## Recommendations\n\n- **Adhere to Medication Schedule**: It is crucial to take your Lamictal and Vyvanse exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider to manage your conditions effectively.\n- **Regular Follow-Up**: Continue regular follow-ups with your neurologist and other healthcare providers to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as necessary.\n- **Monitoring for Interactions**: Always inform your healthcare provider about any other medications, supplements, or substances you are using to avoid potential interactions.\n\nGiven your complex medical history, it is essential to maintain close communication with your healthcare providers to ensure that your treatment plan is optimized and safe."

In the morning I take the 200mg pill with my breakfast fine, but when I take the 500mg tablet after dinner, I swallow the tablet with water like in the morning, I'm coughing up the water and the pill is getting lodged in my throat. This has been happening every other day in the last 2 weeks.I'm coughing up phelgmn and I've tried warm water to force the pill down as it is a enteric-coated pill, which reacts with water straight away. The longer the pill stays in my throat, it scrapes my throat and blood comes out with my spit. My throat is sore afterwards which takes two days to recover. I have to take my Epilepsy pills for life.I'm afraid to keep taking the 500ml tablets in the evening, as I keep having this reaction.Should I take 5 of the 200mg pills instead to make up the 1000mg required in the evening which are easier to swallow or do something else?I'm going to speak to my pharmacist and GP tomorrow morning as well about it.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your difficulty swallowing the 500mg Epilim EC (enteric-coated) tablets, here are some suggestions and considerations:\n\n## Swallowing Issues with Enteric-Coated Tablets\nEnteric-coated tablets, like the 500mg Epilim EC tablets, should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed, as the coating is designed to protect the stomach and release the medication in the intestines. However, if the tablet is getting lodged in your throat, it can cause significant discomfort and injury.\n\n## Alternatives to 500mg Tablets\n\n### Using Multiple 200mg Tablets\nYou can consider taking multiple 200mg tablets to achieve the required dosage. Since the 200mg tablets are not enteric-coated and can be crushed if necessary, they might be easier to swallow. Taking five 200mg tablets in the evening would total 1000mg, which is equivalent to your current dosage of two 500mg tablets. However, it is crucial to consult your pharmacist or GP to ensure this is a safe and effective substitution[2][4][5].\n\n### Other Formulations\n- **Epilim Syrup or Liquid**: If swallowing tablets continues to be a problem, you might discuss switching to Epilim Syrup or Sugar-Free Liquid with your healthcare provider. These forms can be more manageable for some patients and can be accurately measured using a medicine measure[1][4][5].\n\n### Swallowing Techniques\n- **Thickened Liquids**: Sometimes using thickened liquids or foods can help the pill go down more smoothly.\n- **Positioning**: Try taking the pills in an upright position and staying upright for a few minutes afterward to reduce the risk of the pill getting lodged in your throat.\n\n## Consulting Healthcare Professionals\nGiven the severity of your symptoms, including coughing up phlegm and blood due to the pill scraping your throat, it is essential to discuss this issue with your pharmacist and GP as planned. They can provide personalized advice and may need to adjust your medication regimen to ensure you can take your epilepsy medication safely and effectively.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to take your medication as prescribed and be cautious when taking the 500mg tablets to avoid further discomfort or injury."

The only question I did not get to ask him was if I have to continue only taking 1 a day since trokendi is an extended release or if I have to take 2 a day. Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When switching from Trokendi XR (extended-release topiramate) to generic immediate-release topiramate, the dosing schedule will need to be adjusted due to the differences in the release mechanisms of the two formulations.\n\n### Extended-Release (Trokendi XR) vs. Immediate-Release (Topiramate)\n\n- **Trokendi XR** is an extended-release formulation, which means it releases the medication slowly over the course of the day, allowing for once-daily dosing.\n- **Generic immediate-release topiramate** releases the medication more quickly and typically requires multiple doses per day to maintain therapeutic levels.\n\n### Dosing Adjustment\n\n- If you were taking Trokendi XR once a day, you will likely need to take the generic immediate-release topiramate in divided doses. For example, if your daily dose of Trokendi XR was 400 mg, you might need to take 200 mg of generic topiramate twice a day (morning and evening)[3][5>.\n- It is crucial to follow the specific instructions provided by your neurologist or pharmacist, as they can tailor the dosing schedule to your individual needs and ensure a smooth transition.\n\n### Example\n\n- If your maintenance dose on Trokendi XR was 400 mg once daily, your neurologist might prescribe 200 mg of generic topiramate twice daily (e.g., 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening).\n\nAlways consult with your healthcare provider or pharmacist to confirm the correct dosing schedule for the generic immediate-release topiramate, as they can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history and current treatment plan."

I was then sent to a neurologist and they finally diagnosed me with epilepsy but I don't have seizures. for awhile though i was having episodes of \"falling into the ground\" feelings and if i was in the car it would feel like i was falling back. I would just get odd feelings like that. i was told i basically have micro seizures. there's times where i get dizzy and don't feel good or just don't feel right and im guessing it could just be depersonalization but I'm honestly not sure. l've been now struggling with a migraine for over a month now and i had a mri done that came out normal and im having another one and a mra done tomorrow to see if something looks off.

        "answer": "Given your complex set of diagnoses and symptoms, here are some key points and potential connections that might help clarify your situation:\n\n## PCOS and Psychiatric Disorders\n- Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) have a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, including depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and sleep disorders. This is supported by studies indicating that PCOS patients are at a significantly higher risk for these conditions compared to the general population[4][1].\n\n## Epilepsy and Auras\n- You have been diagnosed with epilepsy but do not experience traditional seizures, instead having episodes described as \"micro seizures\" or auras. Auras in epilepsy can manifest in various ways, including headache, dizziness, and other sensory or emotional disturbances. It is notable that headache is a common aura in patients with generalized seizures, and your age of onset could influence this[2][5].\n\n## Migraines and Vertigo\n- Your symptoms of vertigo and migraines could be related to vestibular migraines, which are characterized by vertigo, dizziness, and balance issues, often accompanied by headaches. Vestibular migraines can significantly impact daily life and may require specific treatment strategies, including lifestyle changes and medications[3].\n\n## Overlapping Symptoms and Conditions\n- There is an overlap between the pathophysiology of migraine and epilepsy, with both conditions often involving a hyperexcitable brain. This could explain why you experience auras and migraines that are intertwined with your epilepsy symptoms. The auras in both conditions can include similar symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, and sensory changes, but they typically have different durations and characteristics[5].\n\n## Depersonalization and Anxiety\n- Your feelings of \"falling into the ground\" or depersonalization could be related to your anxiety disorder or the auras associated with your epilepsy. Depersonalization is a common symptom in individuals with anxiety disorders and can also occur as part of the aura phase in epilepsy[1][5].\n\n## Medication and Management\n- You are currently on several medications, including metformin for PCOS, venlafaxine and bupropion for mood stabilization and anxiety, and Topiramate which can be used for both migraines and epilepsy. It is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of these medications and adjust them as necessary under the guidance of your healthcare providers.\n\n## Further Testing\n- Given your ongoing symptoms, the upcoming MRI and MRA tests will help rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, such as structural abnormalities or vascular issues that could be contributing to your migraines and vertigo.\n\n## Multidisciplinary Approach\n- Considering the complexity of your diagnoses, a multidisciplinary approach involving a neurologist, psychiatrist, obstetrician-gynecologist, and possibly a vestibular specialist may be beneficial. This can help in managing the interrelated aspects of your conditions and optimizing your treatment plan.\n\nIt is important to maintain close communication with your healthcare providers about the changes in your symptoms and any new developments. Given the multifaceted nature of your condition, a comprehensive and coordinated care plan will likely be the most effective way to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life."

        "question": "So i had an epilepsy seizure when i was like 4-5 months old. I took medication daily for 7 years, and i had no more seizures. Im 17 years old now. Can my epilepsy come back? If it can what can cause it?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Yes, there is a possibility that your epilepsy could recur even after a long period of being seizure-free. Here are some key factors and considerations:\n\n## Risk Factors for Recurrence\n- **Age of Onset**: Having your first seizure at a very young age, such as 4-5 months, can be a risk factor. Early onset, especially in infancy, is often associated with a higher risk of recurrence[2][5].\n- **Duration of Epilepsy Before Remission**: The longer the duration of epilepsy before achieving remission, the higher the risk of relapse. In your case, you had epilepsy for 7 years before becoming seizure-free[1][3][5].\n- **Type and Number of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)**: Using multiple AEDs or taking a long time to achieve seizure control can increase the risk of recurrence[1][2][5].\n- **EEG Abnormalities**: Abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) results before drug withdrawal are a significant risk factor for recurrence[1][2][5].\n- **Seizure Frequency and Type**: A higher frequency of seizures before remission and certain types of seizures, such as partial seizures, can increase the risk of recurrence[2][5].\n- **Time to Achieve Seizure-Free Status**: A longer period to achieve seizure control and a shorter seizure-free time before drug withdrawal can also increase the risk[4][5].\n\n## General Recurrence Rates\n- Approximately 30-50% of patients who stop their antiepileptic medications after being seizure-free for several years may experience recurrence[3].\n\n## Specific Considerations for Your Case\n- Since you started having seizures at a very young age and took medication for 7 years, you may be at a higher risk due to the early onset and the prolonged duration of your epilepsy before remission.\n- If you had frequent seizures or required multiple AEDs, this could further increase your risk.\n- It is essential to have regular EEG checks and follow-up with your neurologist to monitor any changes that might indicate a higher risk of recurrence.\n\n## Decision to Withdraw Medication\n- The decision to stop antiepileptic medication should be made after a thorough discussion with your neurologist, considering the potential risks and benefits. An individualized harm-benefit assessment is crucial in this decision[3].\n\nIf you decide to stop your medication and seizures recur, most patients can regain seizure control by resuming their previous treatment, although up to 20% may not achieve immediate remission[3]."

        "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The episode your niece experienced could be attributed to several factors, but it is important to differentiate between syncope (fainting) and seizures.\n\n## Syncope\nSyncope, or fainting, is a brief loss of consciousness due to a temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain. Here are some points to consider:\n- Syncope can be triggered by various factors, including dehydration, standing for long periods, heat, anxiety, fear, pain, or stress. In your niece's case, eating ice cream could potentially trigger a vasovagal response, especially if it was cold and caused a sudden change in blood flow or heart rate[4].\n- The symptoms described, such as feeling still, having a headache, and then losing consciousness, could be indicative of a vasovagal syncope. This type of syncope is common and not usually associated with serious underlying conditions.\n\n## Swallow Syncope\nWhile less likely, swallow syncope is another type of situational syncope that can be triggered by swallowing certain foods or beverages, including cold ones. This is often due to a hypersensitive vagotonic reflex and can result in transient heart blocks or other cardiac rhythm disturbances. However, this typically does not involve convulsions[1].\n\n## Seizures\nSeizures are a different condition, typically associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. While some foods and substances can trigger seizures in individuals with epilepsy, there is no clear evidence that ice cream or its components (sugar, dairy) directly trigger seizures in people without a history of epilepsy[2][5].\n\n## Potential Triggers\n- **Brain Freeze:** This could be a contributing factor, but brain freeze usually causes pain and discomfort rather than loss of consciousness or convulsions.\n- **Sugar and Dairy:** While high sugar and dairy intake can be problematic for various health reasons, there is no direct link between these and syncope or seizures in individuals without underlying conditions like epilepsy[5].\n- **Past Episodes:** The fact that your niece has passed out before while eating ice cream suggests a possible pattern, but without other symptoms of a seizure disorder, it is more likely related to syncope.\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven that the EEG was normal and there is no family history of seizures, it is likely that your niece experienced a form of syncope. Here are some steps to consider:\n- **Hydration and Food Intake:** Ensure your niece stays well-hydrated, especially when eating cold or heavy meals.\n- **Medical Advice:** Consult with her doctor to discuss preventative measures, such as sitting down when eating cold foods or beverages, and to rule out any other potential causes.\n- **Monitoring:** Keep a close eye on any future episodes to see if there are specific triggers that can be identified and avoided.\n\nIn summary, while the exact cause needs further medical evaluation, it is more probable that your niece experienced a form of syncope rather than a seizure. Consulting with her healthcare provider for a comprehensive assessment is crucial to determine the best course of action."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several potential explanations for the swollen lymph node, hearing loss, blocked ears, headache, and other issues you are experiencing.\n\n### Swollen Lymph Node\nA swollen lymph node on the left side of your neck could be a response to an infection or another medical condition. Common causes include upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold, sinus infection, or strep throat), ear infections (like middle ear infections or otitis media), and other infections like mononucleosis or skin infections[1][5].\n\n### Hearing Loss and Blocked Ears\nThese symptoms can be associated with middle ear infections (otitis media), which can cause swelling and fluid buildup in the ears, leading to blocked ears and hearing loss. Other conditions such as mastoiditis, TMJ dysfunction, or even migraines could also contribute to these symptoms[2].\n\n### Headache\nHeadaches can occur in conjunction with ear pain due to several conditions, including middle ear infections, TMJ dysfunction, or migraines. A blocked ear can increase pressure, leading to headaches[2].\n\n### Sleep and Appetite Issues\nThese could be related to several factors, including the discomfort from the other symptoms, side effects of your medications, or the underlying conditions of autism, epilepsy, and depression.\n\n### Medication Side Effects\n- **Lamotrigine**: While lamotrigine is generally well-tolerated, it can have side effects such as headaches, dizziness, and sleep disturbances. Rare but serious side effects include swollen lymph nodes as part of a condition like DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), which also involves fever, rash, and other systemic symptoms[4].\n\n### Immediate Actions\nGiven the severity and combination of your symptoms, it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider:\n- **Severe Symptoms**: If you experience severe pain, high fever, fluid or blood draining from the ear, dizziness, or changes in hearing, you should seek immediate medical attention or go to the emergency room[2].\n- **Medication Review**: Your healthcare provider should review your current medications to ensure they are not contributing to your symptoms.\n- **Infection Assessment**: Your provider will need to assess whether an infection is present and treat it accordingly.\n- **Monitoring**: Given your complex medical history, close monitoring by your healthcare team is essential to manage both your current symptoms and any potential interactions or side effects from your medications.\n\nConsulting your healthcare provider promptly will help determine the exact cause of your symptoms and guide appropriate treatment."

        "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several factors that could be contributing to your episodes of lightheadedness and fainting after workouts, particularly those involving pull-ups.\n\n### Vagus Nerve Compression\nThe proximity of the vagus nerve to the hiatal hernia is a plausible explanation. A hiatal hernia can cause mechanical distortion of the vagus nerve as it passes through the esophageal hiatus, leading to alterations in its functional dynamics. This compression could modulate vagal signal transmission, affecting parasympathetic innervation and potentially leading to dysrhythmias or other autonomic disturbances that might cause fainting or lightheadedness, especially during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, like lifting weights[2].\n\n### Dehydration and Blood Pressure Changes\nExercises that involve sudden changes in position or intensity, such as pull-ups, can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing) due to blood pooling in the legs. This condition can cause dizziness and fainting. Dehydration, which can be exacerbated by PPI use affecting nutrient and fluid absorption, may also contribute to these symptoms[4].\n\n### PPI Use and Nutrient Malabsorption\nLong-term use of PPIs can lead to malabsorption of several key nutrients, including magnesium, calcium, and iron, which are crucial for maintaining healthy nerve and muscle function. Magnesium, in particular, is important for heart function and muscle contraction. Deficiencies in these nutrients could potentially contribute to lightheadedness and fainting episodes[3].\n\n### Exertional Syncope\nMost cases of exercise-associated syncope have neurocardiogenic origins and are generally benign, but they can also be signs of underlying cardiac issues. Given that you underwent a series of heart tests without a conclusive explanation, it's possible that your episodes could be related to exertional syncope, which might involve factors such as vasovagal syncope or other neurocardiogenic mechanisms triggered by physical activity[1][5].\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Avoid Triggering Activities**: As your physician advised, avoiding pull-ups and reducing the intensity of your workouts seems to have helped prevent further episodes.\n- **Monitor Hydration and Nutrition**: Ensure you stay hydrated and consider supplementing nutrients that might be affected by PPI use, such as magnesium and calcium, after consulting your physician.\n- **Follow-Up**: Continue to monitor your condition and follow up with your healthcare provider for any changes or new symptoms. The fact that you haven't had an episode in a few years suggests that the current approach is effective, but ongoing monitoring is important.\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and the potential interplay between your hiatal hernia, PPI use, and exercise-induced factors, it's crucial to continue working closely with your healthcare team to manage your condition effectively."

        "question": "I wanted to share my experience with you to maybe get some more information about my situation.For 10 years, I have been experiencing every couple of months sudden deja vu like feeling followed by dissociation. I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your experiences of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu followed by dissociation can be influenced by several factors, including your general anxiety disorder, but they may also involve other neurological and psychological components. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Anxiety and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\nResearch indicates a link between high levels of anxiety and increased frequency and intensity of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences. Studies have shown that individuals with clinical anxiety report higher frequencies of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes, especially during periods of high anxiety. These episodes are also often found to be more distressing for those with anxiety compared to healthy controls[2][5].\n\n## Dissociation\nDissociation, as you're experiencing, can be a coping mechanism for stress and emotional distress. It is often associated with traumatic experiences and can be a symptom of various dissociative disorders. However, in your case, it might be linked to your anxiety and the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes. Dissociation involves disconnection from thoughts, feelings, or bodily sensations, and it can occur as a way to manage overwhelming stress or anxiety[3].\n\n## Neurological Basis\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is often associated with errors in the recognition memory system, particularly involving the hippocampus and amygdala. These brain regions are also implicated in dissociation and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Deficits in these areas, such as those found in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), can lead to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dissociative experiences[1][4].\n\n## Sudden and Stress-Unrelated Episodes\nWhile your episodes seem sudden and not directly related to stress, it's possible that underlying anxiety or other psychological factors are still contributing. Anxiety can manifest in various ways and may not always be immediately apparent. Additionally, the decoupling of cognitive processes in the brain, which can lead to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, might not always be triggered by obvious stressors[4][5].\n\n## Medical Evaluation\nGiven the frequency and nature of your episodes, it might be beneficial to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. While most people experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu without adverse health effects, it can sometimes be a symptom of conditions like TLE. Since you do not experience loss of consciousness, memory loss, or physical symptoms like shaking, it is less likely to be a seizure disorder, but a professional evaluation can provide clarity[4].\n\nIn summary, your experiences are likely influenced by a combination of your general anxiety disorder and the underlying neurological mechanisms involved in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dissociation. Consulting a mental health professional to address your anxiety and any potential trauma or stress factors could be helpful in managing these episodes."

        "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the simultaneous and abrupt cessation of nausea and vomiting in both you, your husband, and your cat upon moving out of the old house, it is likely that the cause was environmental rather than related to medication, anxiety, or the cat's medical issues.\n\nHere are some possible environmental factors that could have contributed to the symptoms:\n\n### Indoor Air Quality or Toxins\nExposure to indoor air pollutants, such as mold, radon, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or other toxins, could have caused the chronic nausea and vomiting. These substances can accumulate in poorly ventilated spaces and affect both humans and animals.\n\n### Water Quality\nContaminated water can also be a source of illness. If the water supply in your old house was tainted with bacteria, heavy metals, or other pollutants, this could have led to the symptoms you experienced.\n\n### Environmental Hazards\nOther environmental hazards like pest control chemicals, lead paint, or asbestos could have been present in the old house. These substances can cause a range of health issues, including nausea and vomiting.\n\n### Mold or Fungal Growth\nDamp environments can foster mold and fungal growth, which can release mycotoxins that cause a variety of health problems, including nausea and vomiting.\n\nGiven that all of you stopped experiencing symptoms immediately after moving, it is crucial to inform the current owner, real estate agent, and future tenants about the potential environmental issues. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Notify the Current Owner and Real Estate Agent**: Inform them about your experiences and suggest that the house be inspected for environmental hazards.\n2. **Environmental Testing**: Consider hiring professionals to test the house for mold, radon, VOCs, and water quality.\n3. **Alert Future Tenants**: Make sure that any future occupants are aware of the potential issues so they can take necessary precautions or avoid the property altogether.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help ensure that no one else experiences the same health issues you did."

        "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and history, here are several factors to consider:\n\n## Myoclonus and Brain Zaps\n\n- **Myoclonus**: The sudden muscle twitches you are experiencing could be a form of myoclonus, which can be caused by various factors including neurological disorders, drug interactions, or substance use. Since you have no history of seizures or epilepsy, it is less likely that you have developed epilepsy, but it is still important to rule out other neurological conditions[1][4].\n\n## Influence of Substances and Medication\n\n- **Recreational Substances**: The combination of alcohol, kratom, and THC, especially in conjunction with your fluoxetine (an SSRI), could have led to a complex interaction that triggered your symptoms. Kratom, in particular, can have significant effects on the nervous system and can interact with SSRIs in unpredictable ways.\n- **Fluoxetine Discontinuation**: The \"brain zaps\" you are describing are a common symptom of SSRI discontinuation syndrome. These can occur even if the discontinuation was not abrupt, as your body adjusts to the lack of the medication. This syndrome can include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal, many of which you are experiencing[2][5].\n\n## Serotonin Syndrome\n\n- **Mild Serotonin Syndrome**: It is possible that the combination of fluoxetine with other substances led to a mild serotonin syndrome, which can cause muscle twitching, among other symptoms. However, if it were a severe case, you would likely have experienced more severe symptoms such as fever, sweating, and changes in mental status, which you did not mention.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nGiven the complexity of your situation, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider:\n- **Rule Out Other Conditions**: A healthcare provider can help determine if your symptoms are due to myoclonus related to substance use and medication interactions or if there is an underlying neurological condition that needs to be addressed.\n- **Manage Symptoms**: Your doctor can help manage the symptoms of SSRI discontinuation syndrome and provide guidance on whether to restart the medication or taper it more slowly to minimize withdrawal symptoms.\n- **Neurological Evaluation**: A thorough neurological evaluation may be necessary to ensure that there are no other underlying conditions that need to be treated.\n\nWhile it is possible that your symptoms could resolve on their own, seeking medical advice will help in determining the best course of action and alleviate any concerns about potential long-term effects."

        "question": "My little sister, age 12, was diagnosed with epilepsy for the last 1 year. She has been taking necessary medications for its cure and prevention. However, she has been ill for the last few days and we ran a few tests waiting to get reports tomorrow. It's 3am now and she has been acting and moving her body weirdly while sleeping for the last hour, we're suspecting she's having nocturnal epilepsy. Moreover, she has been telling us she feels tremor in her stomach for the past 3 days. It would be really nice if anyone could answer the following questions    What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?    What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Here are some detailed answers to your questions based on the information provided:\n\n### General Causes of Epilepsy\n\nEpilepsy can be caused by both genetic and acquired factors.\n\n- **Genetic Factors**: A significant portion of childhood epilepsy has a genetic component. Up to 20 percent of childhood epilepsy cases are inherited, and multiple genes have been linked to epilepsy. Certain syndromes like benign familial neonatal convulsions, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), and autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy are caused by single-gene mutations[1].\n\n- **Acquired Factors**: These include lack of oxygen (hypoxia), head injuries, infections of the central nervous system (such as encephalitis and meningitis), and brain tumors. These conditions can cause seizures and lead to the development of epilepsy[1][4].\n\n### Precautions and Prevention Strategies\n\n#### General Precautions\n- **Prevent Infections**: Ensure your sister and the rest of the family get recommended vaccines and immunizations to protect against infections that could cause seizures and epilepsy[4].\n\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: Encourage a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and not smoking or using tobacco to lower the risk of conditions like stroke, which can cause epilepsy[4].\n\n- **Safe Practices**: Prevent traumatic brain injuries by ensuring proper use of helmets, seatbelts, and safe sports practices. Practice good hygiene and safe food preparation to prevent infections like cysticercosis[4].\n\n#### Individual Precautions\n- **Adhere to Medication**: Ensure your sister takes her anticonvulsant medications as prescribed to control seizures effectively[2][3].\n\n- **Sleep Hygiene**: Improve sleep habits by maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime, and creating a calm sleep environment. Insomnia and other sleep-related issues can exacerbate epilepsy symptoms[3].\n\n### Managing Nocturnal Seizures\n\n- **Medical Consultation**: If you suspect nocturnal seizures, consult a physician, neurologist, or sleep specialist. An overnight sleep study with video monitoring may be recommended for diagnosis[2].\n\n- **Adjust Medication Timing**: Sometimes, adjusting the timing of anticonvulsant medications can help manage nocturnal seizures. For example, taking higher doses in the evening can reduce the frequency of nocturnal seizures[3].\n\n- **Safety During Sleep**: Ensure her sleep environment is safe by removing any hazardous objects, using a mattress on the floor to minimize injury from falls, and considering using a seizure alarm or having someone monitor her during sleep[2].\n\n### Reducing Risks of Serious Injuries\n\n- **Safe Environment**: Create a seizure-safe environment by removing sharp objects, securing furniture, and using padding on the floor to prevent injuries during seizures[5].\n\n- **Supervision**: Ensure supervision, especially during activities that could pose a risk, such as bathing, swimming, or cooking.\n\n- **Emergency Plan**: Develop an emergency plan with your family and caregivers that includes what to do during a seizure, such as turning her onto her side, keeping her airway clear, and not restraining her movements.\n\n- **Regular Check-Ups**: Regular follow-ups with her healthcare provider are crucial to monitor the effectiveness of her treatment and make any necessary adjustments to prevent injuries and seizures.\n\n### Addressing Recent Symptoms\n\nGiven the recent symptoms of weird body movements during sleep and tremors in her stomach, it is important to:\n\n- **Consult Immediately**: Discuss these new symptoms with her healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine if there are any changes needed in her treatment plan or if there is an underlying condition that needs to be addressed.\n- **Monitor Closely**: Keep a close eye on her symptoms and report any changes or worsening of symptoms to her healthcare provider promptly.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can help manage her epilepsy effectively and reduce the risks associated with seizures."

        "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of brain surgery to remove an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) and the subsequent symptoms you are experiencing, it is plausible that you are dealing with a form of neurological deficit that could be related to the surgery or the AVM itself.\n\n## Hemiparesis\nHemiparesis, which is a weakness or partial paralysis of one side of the body, is a possible explanation for your symptoms. This condition can result from damage to the brain, particularly in areas that control motor functions. Since your AVM was located on the right side of your brain, it could have affected the motor control pathways for your left side of the body, even if the surgery itself caused some damage or disruption to these pathways[1][3].\n\n## Post-Surgical Neurological Deficits\nIt is common for patients who have undergone surgery for AVMs to experience neurological deficits, including muscle weakness, numbness, or difficulty with coordination and movement. These deficits can arise due to the initial AVM, the rupture, or the surgical procedure itself. The fact that your neurologist attributes your weakness to the brain surgery aligns with this possibility[1][3].\n\n## Treatment and Rehabilitation\nTo address this limitation, several approaches can be considered:\n\n### Physical Therapy\nWorking with a physical therapist can help you develop strategies to improve strength, coordination, and function in your affected arm and shoulder. Physical therapy can be tailored to your specific needs and may help you regain some of the motor function that is currently impaired[1].\n\n### Occupational Therapy\nOccupational therapy can also be beneficial in helping you adapt to any persistent deficits and find ways to perform daily activities and exercises more effectively.\n\n### Neurological Rehabilitation\nSome neurological rehabilitation programs focus on helping patients recover from brain injuries or surgeries. These programs often include cognitive and motor skill training, which could be beneficial in your case.\n\n### Adaptive Exercises\nYou may need to modify your exercise routine to accommodate your limitations. For example, focusing on exercises that do not exacerbate the weakness or using adaptive equipment could help you continue with weightlifting while avoiding exacerbating the issue.\n\n## Follow-Up with Your Healthcare Provider\nIt would be important to discuss your specific symptoms and the lack of progress with your current exercises with your neurologist or a rehabilitation specialist. They can provide a more detailed evaluation and recommend the most appropriate course of treatment or rehabilitation.\n\nGiven that you do not have scoliosis and your neurologist has already attributed the weakness to the brain surgery, exploring options like physical and occupational therapy, along with adaptive exercise strategies, may be the next steps to help you manage and potentially improve your condition."

I\u2019ve been on birth control since I was 13 because of that. I have insanely painful periods and I know my hormones are out of wack but I\u2019ve never been diagnosed officially with PCOS or endometriosis but I think I could have either one. not sure.I got diagnosed with epilepsy last February after two grand mal seizures on the same day. coincidentally(?)

        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and symptoms, it's crucial to approach your situation with a comprehensive and multidisciplinary perspective. Here are some key points and potential connections between your symptoms and the conditions you're considering:\n\n### Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\n- **Symptoms**: You have several symptoms that align with PCOS, such as ruptured ovarian cysts, painful periods, and hormonal imbalances. PCOS is characterized by irregular or missing periods, high levels of androgens (leading to symptoms like hirsutism, acne, and thinning hair), and the presence of multiple cysts on the ovaries[1][3][5].\n- **Diagnosis**: A diagnosis of PCOS typically involves physical exams, pelvic exams, pelvic ultrasound to check for cysts, and blood tests to determine hormone levels, particularly androgens[1][3][5].\n\n### Endometriosis\n- **Symptoms**: Your experiences with intensely painful periods, pelvic pain, and potentially other gastrointestinal issues are consistent with endometriosis. Endometriosis involves tissue similar to the uterine lining growing outside the uterus, leading to symptoms like severe menstrual cramps, lower back pain, and pain during sex[1][3][5].\n- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosing endometriosis often requires a laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgery to inspect the tissue directly, along with imaging tests and physical exams[1][3][5].\n\n### Epilepsy and Heart Issues\n- **Epilepsy**: The onset of your epilepsy coinciding with your decision to stop birth control could be due to various factors, including hormonal changes. However, the direct link between hormonal changes and the onset of epilepsy is not well understood and would need further investigation.\n  - The alignment of your seizures with your menstrual cycle suggests a possible hormonal influence on your seizure activity.\n- **Heart Issues**: Your diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and the intense heart rate fluctuations during seizures indicate a need for careful cardiac monitoring. The relationship between your seizures and heart flutters suggests that your neurological and cardiac conditions may be interconnected.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation**:\n   - Consult a reproductive endocrinologist or a gynecologist specializing in PCOS and endometriosis to evaluate your hormonal imbalances, ovarian cysts, and menstrual symptoms.\n   - Ensure your epilepsy is being managed by a neurologist, and discuss the potential hormonal influences on your seizure activity.\n\n2. **Multidisciplinary Care**:\n   - Coordinate care between your neurologist, cardiologist, and reproductive health specialist to ensure all aspects of your health are being addressed.\n   - Consider a holistic approach that includes dietary advice, lifestyle changes, and stress management, as these can impact both hormonal and seizure disorders.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**:\n   - For PCOS, expect blood tests to check hormone levels, a pelvic ultrasound to look for ovarian cysts, and a physical exam to assess symptoms like hirsutism and acne.\n   - For endometriosis, a laparoscopy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n   - Continue to monitor your heart condition with the Holter monitor and proceed with the planned ablation for SVT.\n\n4. **Hormonal Considerations**:\n   - Since you have been on birth control to manage your symptoms, discuss with your healthcare providers whether hormonal therapies could impact your epilepsy or heart conditions.\n\n5. **Lifestyle and Support**:\n   - Maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, which can help manage both PCOS and endometriosis symptoms.\n   - Consider seeking support from support groups or counselors to cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of managing multiple chronic conditions.\n\nBy coordinating care among specialists and addressing each condition comprehensively, you can better manage your symptoms and work towards a more normal life."

        "question": "After standing from a prolonged period of sitting (especially when looking at a screen) I have 'episodes' which include spasms and staring. These occur multiple times a day, and I have had an ambulatory eeg. This has been happening for the last 4 years approximatelyThese came back to show that I don't have epilepsy, however my brain waves slow down and they suspect that I have mild cerebal hypoxia.My question is how bad is mild cerebal hypoxia because when severe, it can be very serious. Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Mild cerebral hypoxia, while not as severe as its more acute forms, can still have significant implications for your health and daily functioning.\n\n### Symptoms and Effects\n\nMild cerebral hypoxia can manifest with symptoms such as:\n- Change in attention (inattentiveness)\n- Poor judgment\n- Speech disorder\n- Uncoordinated movement\n- Concentration problems\n- Short-term memory issues\n- Headache, light-headedness, and dizziness[1][5].\n\n### Frequency and Concerns\n\nGiven that you experience these episodes multiple times a day, it is a matter of concern. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n#### Impact on Daily Life\n- Frequent episodes of mild cerebral hypoxia can significantly affect your daily activities, including work, school, or other responsibilities, due to the impact on concentration, attention, and coordination.\n\n#### Underlying Causes\n- The frequent occurrence suggests there might be an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. This could be related to various factors such as blood flow, heart function, or other systemic conditions that might not be immediately evident.\n\n#### Connection to Type 1 Diabetes\n- While your blood test results were normal, it is important to consider how your type 1 diabetes might be influencing your condition. Poor blood sugar control could potentially affect blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, although this is less common.\n\n#### Need for Comprehensive Evaluation\n- Given your symptoms and the frequency of the episodes, a comprehensive evaluation is crucial. Seeing a cardiology specialist is a good step, as they can help determine if there are any cardiac issues contributing to the hypoxia. Additionally, consulting with a neurologist might provide further insights into the brain's function and any possible treatments or interventions.\n\n### Management and Treatment\n\n- **Immediate Intervention**: Since cerebral hypoxia is an emergency condition when severe, even mild forms require prompt attention to prevent progression to more severe states. Basic life support measures, such as ensuring adequate oxygen supply and maintaining stable blood pressure, are crucial[1].\n\n- **Monitoring and Adjustments**: Regular monitoring of your blood sugar levels and any other health metrics can help identify any patterns or correlations that might be contributing to the hypoxia.\n\n- **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Making lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding prolonged periods of inactivity (especially when looking at screens) might help alleviate some symptoms.\n\n### Prognosis\n\n- The prognosis for mild cerebral hypoxia is generally better than for severe forms, but the key is early and consistent management. If the underlying causes are identified and addressed, there is a potential for significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Cardiology Specialist**: Your upcoming appointment with a cardiology specialist is important to rule out any cardiac issues that could be contributing to the hypoxia.\n- **Neurological Evaluation**: Consider consulting a neurologist to get a more detailed understanding of the brain's function and to discuss potential treatments or interventions.\n- **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep a detailed log of your episodes, including any triggers, symptoms, and how long they last. This information will be valuable for your healthcare providers.\n\nIn summary, while mild cerebral hypoxia is not as critical as its severe forms, its frequent occurrence and impact on your daily life necessitate thorough medical evaluation and management to prevent potential complications and improve your overall health."

        "question": "Currently on no medications, BW is normal other than some minor indication of anemia and malnourishment (low folate, hemotacrit, hemoglobin, vitamin d, sodium) high albumin.Family history of a wide variety of mental health conditions as well as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycistic kidneys.Began approximately 4 years ago. Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs. Also have had gastrointestinal issues which i\u2019m not sure if they are relevant or not: nausea and stomach pain after eating anything. Have had some issues with UTI\u2019s. All doctors I have visited have told me there is nothing wrong and make me feel as if they just believe i\u2019m looking for free pills(or a hypochrondiac) but I am still having these issues so i\u2019m not sure where to go from here. pls help",

        "answer": "Given the complex and varied symptoms you are experiencing, it is crucial to consider several potential underlying causes, particularly focusing on nutritional deficiencies and other metabolic issues.\n\n### Nutritional Deficiencies\n\n1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**:\n   - Your symptoms of numbness, tingling, and weakness in the limbs, along with neurological issues such as convulsions and memory problems, could be indicative of a vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuropathy, even in the absence of significant hematological abnormalities[1][4].\n\n2. **Folate Deficiency**:\n   - Although you mentioned low folate levels, it's important to note that folate supplementation can sometimes mask B12 deficiency symptoms without treating the underlying cause. Ensuring proper B12 levels is critical[1].\n\n3. **Thiamine (Vitamin B1) Deficiency**:\n   - Symptoms like convulsions, loss of consciousness, and neurological impairment could also suggest thiamine deficiency, especially considering the history of fainting spells and convulsions. Thiamine deficiency can lead to Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome[2][5].\n\n4. **Other Deficiencies**:\n   - Low vitamin D and sodium levels, as well as gastrointestinal issues, should also be addressed. These can contribute to overall malnutrition and exacerbate neurological symptoms[1][4].\n\n### Anemia and Malnourishment\n\n- Your minor indications of anemia (low hematocrit, hemoglobin) and malnourishment (low folate, vitamin D, sodium) could be contributing to your fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. Proper nutritional supplementation and dietary adjustments may help alleviate these issues.\n\n### Neurological Evaluation\n\n- Despite the normal EEG and MRI findings, the persistence of neurological symptoms suggests a need for further neurological evaluation. Consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in metabolic or nutritional neurology.\n- Tests such as electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and quantitative sensory testing may help identify specific nerve damage or neuropathy[1][4].\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Gastrointestinal Issues**: The nausea and stomach pain after eating could indicate malabsorption issues, which may exacerbate nutritional deficiencies. A gastroenterologist consultation might be helpful.\n- **Family History**: The wide variety of health conditions in your family history, including diabetes, heart disease, and polycystic kidneys, should be considered when evaluating your overall health.\n- **Substance Influence**: The fact that convulsions occur more frequently under the influence of substances suggests a possible interaction between substances and your underlying condition.\n\n### Steps Forward\n\n1. **Comprehensive Nutritional Assessment**:\n   - Ensure a thorough assessment of your nutritional status, including detailed blood work to evaluate levels of B12, folate, thiamine, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients.\n\n2. **Specialized Consultations**:\n   - Consult a neurologist with expertise in metabolic and nutritional disorders.\n   - Consider seeing a gastroenterologist to address gastrointestinal issues.\n\n3. **Dietary Adjustments**:\n   - Implement a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, or consider supplementation under medical guidance.\n\n4. **Follow-Up Care**:\n   - Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the effectiveness of any treatments and adjust as necessary.\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms, it is important to seek care from healthcare providers who can take a holistic approach to your health, considering both nutritional and neurological aspects."

I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",

        "answer": "Given your symptoms, it is important to consider several potential causes and seek a thorough medical evaluation. Here are some points to help guide you:\n\n## Types of Involuntary Movements\nYour symptoms, such as the inability to control your left side of the body, arm movements, and facial scrunching, could be related to various types of involuntary movements. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n### Myoclonus\nMyoclonus is characterized by sudden, shock-like jerking movements. These can be triggered by sudden movements, stress, or other factors, and you remain conscious during the episodes[1][3][5].\n\n### Tics\nTics can involve sudden movements or vocalizations, but they are often repetitive and can be influenced by stress or anxiety[1][3].\n\n### Dystonia\nDystonia involves slow, twisting, or repetitive movements that can affect various parts of the body. It can be triggered by specific actions or stress[1][5].\n\n### Psychogenic Movement Disorders\nThese disorders can mimic other movement disorders but are associated with psychological factors. They often have an acute onset, variable movements, and may be influenced by attention or distraction[3].\n\n## Triggers and Awareness\nYour ability to predict when these episodes might occur, particularly when standing up quickly, jumping unexpectedly, or feeling nervous, suggests a possible link to stress, anxiety, or physical triggers.\n\n## Previous Testing\nSince your EEG and MRI scans from four years ago did not show any abnormalities and did not diagnose epilepsy, it might be helpful to repeat these tests or consider additional evaluations to rule out any new or progressive conditions.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Revisit Your Doctor**: Share the detailed description of your symptoms and the specific triggers you've identified. Emphasize how these episodes affect your daily life.\n2. **Additional Testing**: Request further diagnostic tests such as:\n   - Repeat EEG or MRI to see if there have been any changes.\n   - Blood tests to check for metabolic or electrolyte imbalances.\n   - Neurological examination to assess muscle tone, reflexes, and coordination[5].\n3. **Specialist Consultation**: Consider consulting a neurologist or a movement disorders specialist who can provide a more focused evaluation and treatment plan.\n4. **Stress and Anxiety Management**: Given the link to nervousness and stress, exploring stress management techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation methods, or medications to help manage anxiety might be beneficial[2].\n\n## Home Care and Safety\nIn the meantime, ensure your home environment is safe to prevent falls or injuries during these episodes. Remove clutter, ensure good lighting, and consider using walking aids if necessary[5].\n\nBy pursuing a comprehensive medical evaluation and considering the various types of involuntary movements, you may be able to find a more specific diagnosis and an effective treatment plan."

        "answer": "The use of psychedelics in individuals with epilepsy is a complex and still somewhat understudied area, and several factors need to be considered to assess the potential safety and risks.\n\n## Safety and Risks\n\n- Current clinical trials and research exclude individuals with a history of seizures or epilepsy due to the lack of conclusive evidence on the safety of psychedelics in this population. However, there is no significant evidence that clinically supervised psychedelic use causes or exacerbates seizures in a controlled setting[1][3][5].\n\n## Specific Considerations\n\n- **Type of Epilepsy**: The safety of psychedelics may vary depending on the type of epilepsy. For example, functional seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) might respond differently to psychedelics compared to other forms of epilepsy. However, there is limited data to provide clear guidelines[1].\n\n## Medications and Interactions\n\n- **Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs)**: Interactions between psychedelics and AEDs can be significant. For instance, certain antidepressants and antipsychotics can affect the metabolism of AEDs, and vice versa. Careful monitoring of plasma levels and adjustment of dosages may be necessary when combining these medications[2].\n\n## Dose and Frequency\n\n- **Dose-Related Effects**: There is some evidence suggesting that higher doses of psychedelics, such as psilocybin, may increase the risk of seizures, particularly in individuals with epilepsy. A case report indicates that a patient experienced multiple seizures with a higher dose of psilocybin but not with lower doses[3].\n- **Microdosing vs. High Doses**: The paradoxical effect where microdosing might lead to seizures but high doses do not is not well understood and may be anecdotal. The available data does not support this claim conclusively, and more research is needed to understand the dose-response relationship in the context of epilepsy[3][5].\n\n## Clinical Supervision\n\n- **Controlled Settings**: The safety profile of psychedelics appears to be better in clinically supervised settings. Supervised use ensures that the patient is monitored closely, and any adverse reactions can be managed promptly[1][3].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge:\n\n- **Consultation with Healthcare Providers**: It is crucial to consult with your healthcare providers, including your neurologist and oncologist, before considering the use of psychedelics.\n- **Exclusion from Trials**: Since clinical trials exclude individuals with a history of seizures, there is limited data to support the safe use of psychedelics in this population.\n- **Dose and Medication Monitoring**: Any consideration of psychedelic use would require careful monitoring of doses and potential interactions with other medications.\n- **Rigorous Screening**: Before any psychedelic therapy, rigorous screening to assess the risk of seizures and other adverse effects is essential.\n\nIn summary, while there are some indications that psychedelics might be safe under certain conditions, the lack of concrete evidence and the potential risks mean that caution and thorough medical evaluation are necessary before proceeding."

        "answer": "Given your situation, it's important to consider the potential overlap between epilepsy and ADHD, as well as the impact of your current medication on your symptoms.\n\n## Connection Between Epilepsy and ADHD\nThere is a higher prevalence of ADHD among individuals with epilepsy. Research suggests that the co-occurrence of these conditions could be due to several factors, including genetics, the effects of epilepsy on the brain, or the side effects of antiseizure medications[4].\n\n## Symptoms You're Experiencing\nThe symptoms you described, such as being easily distracted, procrastination, difficulty in focusing, and hyperfocus on non-essential tasks, are consistent with ADHD. These include:\n- Difficulty paying attention and being easily distracted\n- Procrastination and trouble completing tasks\n- Hyperfocus on certain tasks, even if they are not important\n- Restlessness and anxiety\n- Trouble with organization and time management[1][3][5].\n\n## Impact of Lamotrigine\nLamotrigine, your current medication for epilepsy, has been studied in the context of ADHD symptoms. While it is primarily an anticonvulsant, some studies suggest that lamotrigine may not significantly worsen ADHD symptoms and could even have a slightly positive effect, although the evidence is not conclusive[2].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven your concerns and the potential impact on your academic performance, it is crucial to seek a professional evaluation:\n\n1. **Consult Your Neurologist**: Discuss your symptoms with your neurologist who manages your epilepsy. They can provide insights into how your epilepsy and its treatment might be influencing your attention and behavior.\n\n2. **See a Specialist**: Consider consulting a psychiatrist or a specialist in ADHD, who can evaluate you for ADHD. This evaluation will help determine whether your symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Given the potential for a high cost, you might also inquire about any available sliding-scale fee services or local health clinics that offer affordable mental health evaluations.\n\n3. **Counseling and Behavioral Strategies**: Continue working with your college counselor to develop strategies for managing your time, organization, and focus. Behavioral therapy can also be beneficial in addressing some of the symptoms you're experiencing, regardless of whether you are formally diagnosed with ADHD[4].\n\nBy seeking a comprehensive evaluation, you can better understand your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment, which could include adjustments to your medication regimen or additional therapeutic interventions to help manage your ADHD-like symptoms."

        "answer": "Given your boyfriend's medical history and current medication regimen, there are several factors that could be contributing to the drop in his anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels despite an increase in dosage. Here are some potential reasons:\n\n## Drug Interactions\nThe combination of lamotrigine and phenobarbital can lead to significant interactions. Phenobarbital is known to induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can increase the metabolism of lamotrigine, potentially reducing its blood levels[2][5].\nThis interaction could result in lower than expected lamotrigine concentrations, even if the dosage is increased.\n\n## Compliance and Dosage Timing\nIrregular compliance with medication, such as missed doses or varying the timing of doses, can significantly affect blood levels of ASMs. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) can help identify if non-compliance is a factor[1][4].\n\n## Other Medications and Substances\nOther medications or substances he is taking or using could interact with his ASMs. For example, marijuana, although used occasionally, can potentially interact with various medications, including ASMs, though the extent of such interactions is not well-documented.\n\n## Physiological Changes\nChanges in his physiological state, such as weight changes or the development of other medical conditions (like high cholesterol and occasional high blood pressure), can affect how his body metabolizes the medications. Age and other health conditions can influence drug pharmacokinetics[1][4].\n\n## Formulation Changes\nIf there has been a change in the formulation of his medications (e.g., switching from a brand to a generic version), this could affect the absorption and blood levels of the drugs[1].\n\n## Metabolic Variability\nIndividual metabolic variability can also play a role. Children and older adults often have different drug metabolism rates compared to younger adults, but individual differences can occur at any age. Monitoring drug concentrations can help identify if his body is metabolizing the drugs differently over time[1][4].\n\n## Monitoring and Adjustments\nGiven that his medication levels have dropped despite an increase in dosage, it is crucial to monitor his blood levels regularly. TDM can help determine the ideal therapeutic concentration for him and guide any necessary dosage adjustments[1][4].\n\n## Additional Blood Tests\nWaiting on more blood tests is a good step, as these tests can help identify any underlying issues, such as changes in liver or kidney function, that might be affecting drug metabolism. Additionally, monitoring for signs of toxicity or adverse effects due to the current medication regimen is important[2][4].\n\nIn summary, the combination of lamotrigine and phenobarbital, potential compliance issues, physiological changes, and individual metabolic variability are all factors that could contribute to the observed drop in his medication levels. Close monitoring and adjustments guided by TDM will be essential in managing his epilepsy effectively."

The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking.

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the medications you are taking, there are several concerns and potential interactions that need to be addressed:\n\n## Medication Interactions and Side Effects\n\n### Venlafaxine and Wellbutrin\nCombining venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by excessive serotonin levels in the brain. Symptoms include agitation, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, and hallucinations[2][5].\n\n### Addition of Oxcarbazepine\nOxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant that can be used in some cases for mood stabilization or as an adjunct therapy for anxiety and depression. However, introducing this medication while you are already on several others can complicate the side effect profile. Common side effects of oxcarbazepine include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, which could exacerbate your current symptoms[4].\n\n## Side Effects and Recent Experiences\n\n### Reaction to Weed\nThe severe reaction you experienced after using weed, including muscle tightness, hallucinations, and extreme fear, suggests a potentially dangerous interaction between the marijuana and your medications. This is consistent with warnings that psychiatric medications can have adverse interactions with substances like marijuana[1].\n\n### Current Symptoms\nYour current symptoms of increased suicidal thoughts, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue could be related to the medications or their interactions. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n- **Suicidal Thoughts**: This is a serious side effect that needs immediate attention. It could be a reaction to the medication combination or the recent traumatic experience. You should discuss this urgently with your psychiatrist[4][5].\n- **Muscle and Joint Pain**: This could be a side effect of the medications, especially oxcarbazepine, or a residual effect from the recent adverse reaction to weed.\n- **Hallucinations and Visual Distortions**: These symptoms are alarming and could be indicative of a serious drug interaction or an adverse reaction to one or more of your medications[5].\n\n## Communication with Your Psychiatrist\n\nIt is crucial to have a detailed and urgent conversation with your psychiatrist about your current symptoms and the recent adverse reaction to weed. Here are some points to discuss:\n\n- **Medication Adjustments**: Review the necessity and safety of continuing the current medication regimen. Consider alternative medications that might have a better side effect profile for you.\n- **Monitoring**: Ensure that you are closely monitored for any signs of serotonin syndrome or other severe side effects.\n- **Substance Use**: Emphasize the importance of avoiding substances like marijuana and alcohol while on these medications.\n- **Suicidal Thoughts**: Address the increased suicidal thoughts immediately, and explore additional support options such as therapy or crisis hotlines.\n\nGiven the complexity and severity of your symptoms, it may be wise to seek a second opinion or consult with another healthcare professional to ensure you are receiving the most appropriate and safe treatment."

        "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and family history of epilepsy, it is prudent to consider the possibility of temporal lobe epilepsy or another form of focal epilepsy. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Auras and Pre-Seizure Symptoms\n- You described experiencing random tastes or smells, bursts of euphoria, and strong dissociation, which are similar to the auras associated with temporal lobe seizures. These auras can include abnormal sensations, hallucinations (such as smells, tastes), vivid d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or intense emotions not related to the current situation[1][2][4].\n\n## Sleep-Related Symptoms\n- Your sleep issues, particularly the semi-conscious, dream-like states when attempting to nap, and the feelings of being locked-in similar to sleep paralysis, could be indicative of seizure activity. Temporal lobe seizures can cause automatism (repetitive, unconscious movements), altered states of consciousness, and post-seizure confusion[1][4].\n\n## Physical Sensations\n- The buzzing sensations in your body, especially after these episodes, and the rapid head movements are consistent with the motor disturbances and autonomic symptoms seen in temporal lobe seizures. These can include abdominal pain, nausea, sweating, flushing, dilated pupils, or rapid heartbeat[1][4].\n\n## Memory and Consciousness\n- The lack of memory for specific events during these episodes and the confusion that follows are common post-seizure symptoms. People with temporal lobe epilepsy may not remember having had a seizure if they remained conscious during the event[1].\n\n## Family History\n- Your family history of epilepsy is an important factor to consider, as it increases the likelihood of you having a seizure disorder[1][4].\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n- It is important to differentiate these symptoms from migraine auras, as you have been treating them. While migraine auras can include visual, sensory, and emotional symptoms, the characteristics and duration often differ. Migraine auras typically last longer (10-30 minutes), and visual auras in migraines tend to affect both sides of the visual field more variably than those in epilepsy, which often affect one side consistently[5].\n\nGiven these observations, it is crucial to discuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor, especially highlighting the family history of epilepsy and the specific nature of your auras and sleep-related episodes. A comprehensive evaluation, possibly including an EEG or other diagnostic tests, will help determine whether you are experiencing seizures or another condition."

        "question": "Male 31 non smoker 6\u20191\u201d 250lbs, no history of epilepsy/seizuresI have always had sensitivity to lights while driving, especially at night. Things such as normal car headlights and signals have not caused a problem, however when it\u2019s been raining or wet it causes the lights to be reflected off the pools of water it often disorients me and causes a dizzy feeling. I am in An area where it doesn\u2019t rain now and yesterday had to drive through a tunnel covered with a crazy amount of LED lights, and with them reflecting off the cars I became almost instantly overwhelmingly dizzy and nauseous and had to pull over for 15 minutes for it to stop. I am not sure what is causing it, but I am afraid to drive at night or in certain areas because of this issue.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the specific scenarios you've described, here are several potential causes and considerations for your light sensitivity and the accompanying dizziness and nausea:\n\n## Light Sensitivity and Reflections\n- The reflection of lights off water or wet surfaces, as well as the intense LED lights in the tunnel, suggests that you might be experiencing a form of photophobia or light sensitivity. This can be exacerbated by reflective surfaces and high-intensity light sources[1][5].\n\n## Visual Overstimulation\n- The dizzy and nauseous feelings could be due to visual overstimulation. Bright, reflected lights can cause discomfort and disorientation, especially if you are already sensitive to light. This is similar to the way people with migraines or light sensitivity react to certain visual stimuli[1][3].\n\n## Potential Underlying Conditions\n- While you don't have a history of epilepsy or seizures, it's still important to rule out other potential causes. Here are a few:\n  - **Migraines or Ocular Migraines**: These can cause light sensitivity, dizziness, and nausea. Ocular migraines may not always be accompanied by a headache[1].\n  - **Eye Infections or Inflammations**: Conditions like keratitis, uveitis, or other inflammatory eye conditions can cause light sensitivity and other symptoms[1][5].\n  - **Corneal Abrasions**: A scratched cornea can make your eyes more sensitive to light, although this typically would be accompanied by other symptoms like eye pain or blurred vision[1].\n  - **Dry Eye Syndrome**: This can also contribute to light sensitivity and discomfort, especially in certain environments[5].\n\n## Driving Tips and Precautions\n- To manage your symptoms while driving, consider the following:\n  - **Clean and Maintain Your Vehicle**: Ensure your windshield and mirrors are clean to reduce glare and reflections[3].\n  - **Anti-Reflective Coating**: Add an anti-reflective coating to your glasses to help reduce reflections[3].\n  - **Dim Interior Lights**: Dim the interior lights of your vehicle to reduce contrast and glare[3].\n  - **Night Setting on Rear View Mirror**: Use the night setting on your rear view mirror to minimize glare from other vehicles[3].\n  - **Avoid High Beams**: When possible, avoid looking directly at oncoming high beams and instead focus on the road markings[3].\n\n## Medical Evaluation\n- Given the severity of your symptoms and the impact on your driving, it is advisable to consult an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a thorough evaluation. They can help determine if there is an underlying eye condition or other medical issue contributing to your light sensitivity and associated symptoms[1][5].\n\nBy addressing these potential causes and taking preventative measures, you may be able to reduce your discomfort and improve your ability to drive safely at night."

        "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation with generalized epilepsy, here are some points and potential steps you could consider:\n\n## Medication Review\n- You are currently taking lamotrigine, which is a commonly recommended first-line treatment for generalized onset seizures[3][5].\n- If your seizures are not well-controlled, your neurologist might consider switching to another first-line medication such as levetiracetam or valproic acid (though valproic acid is generally avoided in women of childbearing potential due to its risks, it is not a concern in your case)[3].\n- If the current monotherapy is not effective, a combination of medications or a different monotherapy could be explored.\n\n## Driving Restrictions\n- In the UK, the driving regulations for individuals with epilepsy are strict. For Group 1 licenses (car and motorcycle), you must not drive if you have had an unprovoked seizure in the last year, unless specific criteria are met (e.g., seizures only while asleep or seizures that do not affect consciousness)[2][4].\n- Given your seizures occur about once a month, you would not meet the criteria to drive.\n- For any changes in your driving status, you need to consult with the DVLA and follow their guidelines.\n\n## Additional Treatment Options\n- If anti-seizure medications are not controlling your seizures, other treatment options could be considered:\n  - **Special Diets**: Diets like the ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet might be helpful, especially if you are not a candidate for surgery[5].\n  - **Surgery**: If you have focal seizures or if your seizures are localized to a specific area of the brain, surgical options such as resection, disconnection, or stereotactic radiosurgery might be considered. However, this is typically suggested after multiple medication trials have failed[5].\n  - **Neuromodulation Devices**: Devices like vagus nerve stimulators or other neuromodulation implants can be effective in reducing seizure frequency[5].\n\n## Second Opinion\n- Given that you have had the same neurologist since your diagnosis and the lack of progress, it might be beneficial to seek a second opinion from another specialist. This could provide a fresh perspective or additional treatment options that have not been explored yet.\n\n## Lifestyle Considerations\n- Managing your lifestyle to reduce seizure triggers is important. This includes maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, keeping a healthy diet, and managing stress[5].\n\n## Support and Resources\n- Consider joining support groups or organizations that provide resources and advice for people living with epilepsy. These can offer emotional support, practical advice, and updates on the latest treatments.\n\nBy exploring these options and potentially seeking a second opinion, you may find better ways to manage your epilepsy and improve your quality of life."

        "question": "22F, 5\u20195, 173lb, whitehi there! weird thing happened last night and i\u2019m nervous and hoping someone might have some input for me. i recently started taking prozac (10mg) in conjunction with lamictal (125mg) (which i\u2019ve been on for about 6 weeks) for MDD. i\u2019ve had a huge decrease in appetite which has led to me forgetting to eat a lot. yesterday i ate very little - almost nothing, without realizing. i was smoking weed with my partner and i started to feel really unwell. i have a low tolerance so i didn\u2019t think much of it. i remember telling him i wanted to lay down, and next thing i knew i woke up to him holding me and saying my name over and over. he asked me a bunch of questions about my surroundings and personal information (address, birthday, etc.) to make sure i was aware and coherent. he said i was sitting there, mentioned i wanted to lay down, and then my body stiffened/seized up and i slid down the chair backwards until i was on the floor and he started trying to wake me up. he said in total, i was out for less than a minute, but he was worried i was having a seizure. while i was out, i was having what felt like a short lucid dream where i was rolling down a mountain, if that\u2019s important. when i came back to my senses, i was sweating a lot, and was nauseous. i laid on the floor for a little bit until i felt okay, and then went to bed. today i feel fine.i figured i just fainted bc i hadn\u2019t eaten and i was smoking, but i know serotonin syndrome can cause seizures so i\u2019m just feeling very anxious and wondering if i\u2019m worrying over nothing. i\u2019ve never fainted or had a seizure so i don\u2019t really know what either one feel like.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering the combination of Lamictal (lamotrigine) and Prozac (fluoxetine) as described in your scenario, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Potential Interactions\n- There is no highly clinically significant interaction between lamotrigine and fluoxetine that would necessitate avoiding their combination entirely. However, the combination can still have some effects that need monitoring. For instance, both drugs can affect mood and cognitive function, and combining them may enhance these effects[1>.\n\n## Side Effects and Symptoms\n- The symptoms you described, such as feeling unwell, nausea, sweating, and a brief loss of consciousness, could be due to several factors. Here are a few possibilities:\n  - **Serotonin Syndrome**: Although rare, this is a possibility when using multiple serotonergic medications like fluoxetine. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, sweating, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and in severe cases, seizures. However, the symptoms you described do not fully align with the typical presentation of serotonin syndrome, which usually includes more pronounced changes in mental status and autonomic function[3][5].\n  - **Hypoglycemia or Dehydration**: Not eating and possibly being dehydrated could lead to fainting, especially when combined with the effects of marijuana.\n  - **Drug Effects**: Both lamotrigine and fluoxetine can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in appetite. These effects could be exacerbated by not eating and using marijuana[3].\n\n## Specific Concerns\n- The episode you described, with stiffening of the body and a brief loss of consciousness, could be a seizure, although it is also possible it was a syncopal episode (fainting) due to the combination of factors mentioned.\n- Lamotrigine can cause seizures, but this is more common in people not taking the medication as prescribed or in those with a history of seizure disorders. However, the description of a \"short lucid dream\" and the brief duration of the episode makes a seizure less likely but does not rule it out entirely.\n\n## Recommendations\n- It is crucial to consult your doctor about this incident. They will need to assess whether the episode was related to the medications, lack of food, marijuana use, or another underlying condition.\n- Ensure you are eating regularly to maintain your blood sugar levels and hydration status, especially when taking these medications.\n- Discuss with your doctor the possibility of adjusting your medication dosages or monitoring for any signs of serotonin syndrome or other adverse effects.\n\nGiven the complexity of your situation, a healthcare professional's evaluation is essential to determine the cause of your symptoms and to adjust your treatment plan accordingly."

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The issues you are experiencing can be attributed to several factors related to the management and withdrawal of your antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), as well as the specific characteristics of your epilepsy. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Risk of Seizure Recurrence After Withdrawal\n- The risk of seizure recurrence after stopping AEDs is significant, especially if the underlying epilepsy is not fully controlled or if there are specific risk factors present. Studies show that the risk of recurrence can be as high as 26-63% depending on the patient population and individual risk factors[3][5].\n\n## Type of Epilepsy and Seizure Types\n- You have a history of myoclonic seizures and full-tonic seizures, which suggests you might have a form of generalized epilepsy, possibly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). JME is known to have a higher risk of relapse if AEDs are discontinued[1][3].\n\n## Incomplete Understanding of Myoclonic Seizures\n- It appears that your myoclonic seizures were not fully recognized or addressed by your previous neurologists, which could have led to inadequate treatment and monitoring. Myoclonic seizures can be a warning sign for more severe seizures and should be taken seriously[2].\n\n## Dosage and Medication Changes\n- The abrupt change in medication dosage and type can be destabilizing. Switching from Keppra to a significantly lower dose of Lamotrigine without a proper tapering protocol can lead to a rebound effect, increasing the risk of seizures. The dosage of 25mg Lamotrigine is much lower than what you were previously taking (100mg twice daily), which could be insufficient to control your seizures[1][3].\n\n## Sleep and Seizure Triggers\n- Sleep disturbances can be a significant trigger for seizures, especially myoclonic seizures. The fact that you experienced dozens of myoclonic seizures during periods of poor sleep highlights the importance of maintaining good sleep hygiene and possibly adjusting your medication to better manage sleep-related seizures[2].\n\n## Current Medication Regimen\n- Your current regimen of 100mg Lamotrigine plus 1g Keppra twice daily, along with Clobazam for sleep-related myoclonic seizures, indicates that you are still experiencing significant seizure activity. This suggests that your current treatment may not be fully optimized to control your seizures effectively.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Re-evaluate Your Medication:** Consult with your neurologist to reassess your medication regimen. Given your history, it may be necessary to adjust the dosage and type of AEDs to better control your seizures.\n- **Individualized Risk Assessment:** An individualized risk assessment should be conducted to understand your specific risk factors for seizure recurrence and to tailor your treatment plan accordingly[1][5].\n- **Monitoring and Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up with your neurologist is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of your current treatment and to make any necessary adjustments.\n- **Lifestyle Adjustments:** Ensuring good sleep hygiene and managing other potential triggers can help in reducing the frequency and severity of your seizures.\n\nGiven the complexity and the specific nature of your epilepsy, it is important to work closely with a neurologist who can provide a personalized treatment plan to help manage your seizures effectively."

        "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "### Frequency and Causes of Tonic-Clonic Seizures\n\nTonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are not rare but can be caused by a variety of factors beyond just epilepsy.\n\n- **Epilepsy**: This is the most common cause, but tonic-clonic seizures can also be triggered by other health issues such as high fevers, head injuries, infections (like encephalitis or meningitis), low levels of essential minerals (glucose, sodium, calcium, or magnesium), drug or alcohol misuse or withdrawal, and congenital or developmental brain anomalies[1][3][5].\n\n- **Isolated Incidents**: Some people may experience a single tonic-clonic seizure without any underlying epilepsy or other ongoing health issues. In such cases, further seizures may not occur, and treatment might not be necessary[1][3][5].\n\nGiven that your initial tests show no abnormalities, it's possible that this was an isolated incident or that the cause has yet to be identified. The upcoming MRI and neurologist appointment will help clarify the situation.\n\n### Post-Seizure Precautions and Activities\n\nAfter experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure, it is prudent to take certain precautions to ensure your safety.\n\n### Immediate Post-Seizure Period\n- You have already been advised to limit screen time and avoid driving for a while, which is a good start.\n- Your decision to stay with your family and have your partner, who is an EMT, nearby is also wise[1].\n\n### Returning to Hobbies\n- **Physical Activities**: It is generally recommended to avoid activities that could pose a risk if you were to have another seizure. For example, activities that involve heights, water, or operating machinery should be avoided until your healthcare provider gives you clearance.\n  - For dancing, you might want to wait until you get a clear go-ahead from your healthcare provider. If you do return to dancing, consider having a buddy or partner who is aware of your situation.\n  - Using a sewing machine could also pose a risk if you were to seize while operating it. It would be wise to wait for medical clearance before resuming such activities[1][3][5].\n\n### Ongoing Monitoring\n- Since you have been instructed to adjust your medication (lowering your Wellbutrin dosage), it is important to follow this advice and monitor any changes in your symptoms.\n- Keep your upcoming neurologist appointment to discuss the seizure and any chronic headaches you're experiencing. This will help in determining the best course of action moving forward.\n\nBy being cautious and following medical advice, you can minimize risks and ensure a safe return to your normal activities."

        "answer": "Your experience with epilepsy, particularly the lack of identifiable triggers or causes, is not unusual. Here are some key points that might help you understand your condition better:\n\n## Idiopathic Epilepsy\nYour epilepsy appears to fall under the category of idiopathic epilepsy, which means that there is no identifiable cause for the seizures. This type of epilepsy is characterized by the absence of any structural abnormalities in the brain that can be detected through imaging scans, such as MRI or CT scans[3][5].\n\n## Genetic Predisposition\nDespite the lack of a clear cause, idiopathic epilepsy is often suspected to have a genetic component. Mutations in genes related to ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and other neural pathways are believed to contribute to this type of epilepsy. Family history can also be a risk factor, although it is not always present[3][5].\n\n## No Apparent Triggers\nIt is common for people with idiopathic epilepsy to experience seizures without any obvious triggers. Triggers such as flashing lights, stress, sleep deprivation, or hormonal changes are more typical for other types of epilepsy. In your case, the seizures seem to occur randomly, which is consistent with idiopathic epilepsy[3][4].\n\n## Types of Seizures\nIdiopathic epilepsy can involve various types of seizures, including generalized seizures such as absence seizures, myoclonic jerks, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures). The specific type of seizure you experience can help in further categorizing your epilepsy[3][5].\n\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\nDiagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy typically involves a detailed patient history, neurological examination, and diagnostic tests like electroencephalogram (EEG). Treatment usually begins with anti-seizure medications, and in some cases, other approaches like diet changes or nerve stimulation may be recommended if the seizures are not well-controlled by medication alone[2][3][4].\n\n## Lack of Structural Abnormalities\nUnlike other forms of epilepsy caused by structural brain abnormalities such as brain tumors, head trauma, or infections, idiopathic epilepsy does not have any detectable structural cause. This makes the diagnosis and management more focused on controlling the seizures rather than addressing an underlying structural issue[3][5].\n\nGiven your description, it seems you are managing your epilepsy with the help of healthcare professionals, which is crucial. Continuing to monitor your condition and adjusting your treatment plan as necessary can help in managing your seizures effectively."

        "question": "I am not a doctor, but I know my body and I am no fool. I also try to avoid going to the doctor unless necessary, so I try to make sure I have to go before I do. My doctors tend to mark me up to either being a hypochondriac or having drug seeking behaviour.For example: I have very severe epilepsy, and the Keppra I am on is no longer working; I am having multiple seizures in a row every month along with, almost constant myoclonic jerks in my legs. I asked my doctor to please change me from the Keppra about 6 months ago, when it first started showing signs of no longer working. Last month I had 9 focal-to-generalized seizures without becoming aware between them.In short, pharmaceutical companies tell me to ask my doctor about certain meds, but when I do, they blow me off.Bonus Question: What do you recommend for these seizures? They are almost always triggered by hormones, stress level, and being asleep.Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation with severe epilepsy and the ineffectiveness of your current medication, it is crucial to approach your treatment with a comprehensive and multi-faceted strategy. Here are some recommendations and considerations:\n\n## Medication Adjustment\n- Since Keppra is no longer effective, it is essential to work with your doctor to find an alternative or additional anti-seizure medication. There are many other options available, and it may take some trial and error to find the right combination. Insist on a thorough medication review and consider seeking a second opinion from an epilepsy specialist if necessary[1][4].\n\n## Alternative Therapies\n- **Surgery**: If your seizures are focal and originating from a specific area of the brain, surgical options such as removing the affected area or minimally invasive procedures like MRI-guided stereotactic laser ablation might be considered. However, this should be discussed with a neurosurgeon and an epilepsy specialist to determine if it is a viable option for you[1][4].\n\n## Seizure Devices\n- **Vagus Nerve Stimulation**: This involves an electrical device placed under the skin to stimulate the vagus nerve, which can help reduce the frequency of seizures[1][4].\n- **Responsive Neurostimulation**: Another device that can be implanted in the brain to detect and prevent seizures by sending electrical impulses to the seizure focus[1][4].\n\n## Hormonal Considerations\n- Given that your seizures are triggered by hormonal changes, discussing your menstrual cycle, menopause, or other hormonal fluctuations with your doctor is crucial. For women, hormonal seizures (catamenial epilepsy) are common, and adjusting medication or using hormonal therapies might help manage these seizures[5].\n\n## Stress and Sleep Management\n- Stress and sleep deprivation are known to trigger seizures. Implementing stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help. Ensuring a consistent sleep schedule and addressing sleep disorders if present is also important[2][5].\n\n## Special Diets\n- If medication and other treatments are not effective, a ketogenic diet or other specialized diets might be considered. These diets have been shown to reduce seizure frequency in some individuals, particularly those with drug-resistant epilepsy[1].\n\n## Communication with Your Doctor\n- It is important to maintain clear and assertive communication with your healthcare provider. Keep a detailed seizure diary to document the frequency, severity, and potential triggers of your seizures. This can help your doctor make more informed decisions about your treatment. If you feel your concerns are being dismissed, consider seeking a second opinion or consulting with an epilepsy specialist[1][4].\n\n## Addressing Misconceptions\n- To avoid being labeled as a hypochondriac or drug seeker, it may be helpful to prepare for your appointments by writing down your symptoms, the frequency of seizures, and any triggers you've identified. Bringing this information and any relevant medical records can help support your case and ensure your concerns are taken seriously.\n\nBy taking a proactive and informed approach to your treatment, you can work more effectively with your healthcare providers to find a solution that better manages your epilepsy."

        "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your partner's history and current situation, here are some key points and advice to consider:\n\n### Understand the Seizure Type and History\nYour partner has a history of grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures, which are common in people with epilepsy. The removal of the front temporal lobe, a procedure known as a temporal lobectomy, is often performed to reduce or eliminate seizures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)[2][5.).\n\n### Recent Increase in Seizures\nThe sudden increase in seizures, including both grand mal and cognitive seizures, is concerning and may indicate several things:\n- **Medication Compliance**: Ensure that your partner is taking his antiseizure medications as prescribed. Non-compliance can lead to an increase in seizures[4][5].\n- **Changes in Seizure Threshold**: Various factors such as stress, sleep deprivation, fatigue, or changes in medication can alter the seizure threshold, leading to more frequent seizures[1][3][5].\n\n### Immediate Care and Safety\n- **First Aid**: You have been doing the right thing by laying him on his side during a seizure and keeping the area clear to prevent injury. Do not put anything in his mouth, and time the seizure. If a seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, it is considered an emergency and you should call emergency services[5].\n- **Hydration and Medication**: Continue to ensure he stays hydrated and takes his medication as prescribed, even if he resists. This is crucial for managing his seizures.\n\n### Communication with Family and Medical Professionals\n- **Seek Medical Advice**: Despite the family's concerns about his license, it is crucial to consult with his healthcare provider about the recent increase in seizures. The healthcare provider can adjust his medication or explore other treatment options to better manage his seizures[2][5].\n- **Family Concerns**: Explain to his family that the current situation is not sustainable and that medical advice is necessary to prevent further complications or injuries.\n\n### Psychological and Social Support\n- **Support and Understanding**: It is not uncommon for people recovering from seizures to be confused, exhausted, or irritable. Be patient and understanding, and reassure him that you are there to support him[1][5].\n- **Professional Help**: Consider seeking advice from a neurologist or epileptologist who can provide comprehensive care and adjustments to his treatment plan. Additionally, counseling or support groups can help both of you cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of living with epilepsy[2][4].\n\n### Emergency Situations\n- **Emergency Contact**: If you are worried about his safety or if the seizures are becoming more frequent or severe, do not hesitate to contact emergency services. The risk to his health and safety outweighs the concern about his driver's license.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Keep a Seizure Diary**: Tracking the timing, duration, and any triggers of his seizures can be very helpful for his healthcare provider in adjusting his treatment plan.\n- **Follow Safety Guidelines**: Ensure he follows safety guidelines such as avoiding heavy machinery, high places, and being alone in water to minimize the risk of injury during a seizure[4].\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help ensure your partner receives the necessary medical care and support to manage his condition effectively."

        "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While epilepsy is typically characterized by a pre-existing neurological condition, anxiety and stress can play significant roles in both triggering seizures and potentially influencing the development of epilepsy in certain cases.\n\n## Triggering Seizures\n\nFor individuals who already have epilepsy, stress and anxiety are well-documented triggers for seizures. Stress can release hormones such as cortisol, which have excitatory and proconvulsant properties that can increase the susceptibility to seizures[3][4][5].\n\n## Influence on Epilepsy Development\n\nWhile stress and anxiety are not primary causes of epilepsy, they can contribute to the development of the condition in several ways:\n\n- **Impact on Brain Development**: Severe or chronic stress, especially in young children, can affect brain development and potentially increase the risk of developing epilepsy[5].\n- **Neuroinflammation and Neurological Changes**: Chronic stress can promote neuroinflammation and alter neurotransmitter balance, which may contribute to the development or worsening of epilepsy[4].\n- **Stress-Induced Seizures**: In some cases, severe acute stress or persistent exposure to stress can increase the susceptibility to seizures, even in individuals without a prior history of epilepsy. However, this would not be considered epilepsy unless the seizures become recurrent and unprovoked[3][4].\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Anxiety and stress are more likely to trigger seizures in individuals who already have epilepsy rather than causing epilepsy in those who are not prone to it.\n- Chronic stress can have deleterious effects on the brain, potentially contributing to the development or worsening of epilepsy.\n- Management of stress and anxiety is crucial for individuals with epilepsy to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures[1][2][5].\n\nIn the case of a 17-year-old male without a prior history of epilepsy, while stress and anxiety could potentially trigger a seizure, it would be unusual for these factors alone to lead to the development of epilepsy without other underlying neurological conditions. However, if such seizures do occur, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying neurological issues."

        "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your daughter's complex medical history and the symptoms she is experiencing, it is crucial to approach her condition with a thorough and multidisciplinary evaluation. Here are some key points and potential causes to consider:\n\n### Abdominal Pain and Weight Loss\n- The combination of abdominal pain, especially when localized to the right side of the navel, and unintentional weight loss is concerning and needs immediate medical attention. These symptoms could be indicative of several serious conditions[2][4][5,.\n\n### Specific Symptoms\n- **Pain Location and Characteristics**: The pain being described as stabbing/throbbing and worsening after eating and activity is significant. Localized pain to the right of the navel could suggest conditions like appendicitis, although the absence of fever and vomiting makes this less likely but not impossible[1][3][5].\n- **Dizziness and Lightheadedness**: These symptoms, coupled with abdominal pain and weight loss, may indicate dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other systemic issues.\n- **Lump in the Throat**: This sensation could be related to anxiety or a gastrointestinal issue affecting her appetite and eating habits.\n\n### Medical History\n- **Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder**: Her bowel issues, including a colon that is 2x larger than normal and reduced sensation, could contribute to chronic constipation and abdominal pain. The medications she is on (Linzess, Lactulose, Bisacodyl) suggest an ongoing effort to manage bowel function, but the pain and weight loss indicate a possible need for a reassessment of her bowel management plan[1][5].\n\n### Potential Causes\n- **Gastrointestinal Issues**:\n  - Despite normal blood work, conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis, need to be considered. These conditions can cause chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits[2][3][5].\n  - Intestinal obstruction or intussusception could also be potential causes, especially given her bowel redundancies and constipation issues[1][3][5].\n- **Other Systemic Conditions**:\n  - Chronic infections, parasitic infections, or other systemic illnesses could be contributing to her symptoms. Although her blood work is mostly normal, some conditions might not be evident in initial tests[2][4].\n- **Psychological Factors**:\n  - Generalized anxiety and sensory processing disorder could exacerbate her physical symptoms. Stress and anxiety can lead to abdominal pain and changes in appetite[1][3].\n\n### Immediate Steps\n- **Consult a Gastroenterologist**: Given the complexity of her bowel issues and the new symptoms, consulting a pediatric gastroenterologist is essential.\n- **Imaging Studies**: Considering her symptoms, imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scans, or endoscopy might be necessary to evaluate the cause of her abdominal pain and rule out conditions like appendicitis, IBD, or intestinal obstruction[1][3][5].\n- **Nutritional Evaluation**: Since she is experiencing weight loss and reduced appetite, a nutritional evaluation to ensure she is getting adequate nutrients is important. This may involve seeing a dietitian to plan a diet that helps her maintain weight and manage her symptoms[4].\n\n### Medication Review\n- A review of her current medications with her healthcare provider is necessary to determine if any of her medications could be contributing to her symptoms or if adjustments need to be made.\n\nGiven the severity and persistence of her symptoms, it is crucial to seek immediate and comprehensive medical evaluation to identify the underlying cause and initiate appropriate treatment."

        "question": "Not sure if this is allowed- (20F/medical MJ patient/white) I've been trying to get this figured out for YEARS now, no one takes me seriously. Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing could be indicative of several conditions, but given your specific experiences, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a possibility that should be considered.\n\n### Key Points to Consider:\n\n1. **Deja Vu**: This is a common aura symptom in TLE. Deja vu is a feeling of familiarity or a sense that you have already experienced the current situation, even if you know you haven't. It is often associated with temporal lobe seizures[2][4][5].\n\n2. **Nausea and Abdominal Discomfort**: These are also common symptoms that can precede or occur during temporal lobe seizures. Nausea and abdominal discomfort can be part of the autonomic symptoms associated with TLE[4][5].\n\n3. **Head Tingling/Pressure**: Sensory disturbances such as tingling, numbness, or pressure in the head, particularly in the temples, can be symptoms of seizures originating in the temporal lobe. The pressure in the occipital lobe and temples aligns with the areas often affected by temporal lobe seizures[1][4].\n\n4. **Frequency and Duration**: Your episodes lasting less than 10 minutes and occurring multiple times a day for a week, followed by periods of remission, are consistent with the episodic nature of seizures. Temporal lobe seizures can be brief and may occur in clusters[1][5].\n\n5. **Aura Symptoms**: The presence of an aura, which is a warning sign before the seizure, is typical in TLE. Your ability to predict what is going to happen before it does could be part of this aura phase[4][5].\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven the complexity and potential seriousness of these symptoms, it is crucial to seek a thorough medical evaluation. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n- **Consult a Neurologist**: A neurologist specializing in epilepsy can evaluate your symptoms and medical history to determine if you have temporal lobe epilepsy or another condition.\n  \n- **Diagnostic Tests**: You may undergo various tests such as an EEG (electroencephalogram), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or other neuroimaging tests to help diagnose the source and extent of the seizures.\n\n- **Keep Your Logs**: Continuing to keep detailed logs of your episodes can provide valuable information to your healthcare provider.\n\n- **Discuss Treatment Options**: If diagnosed with TLE, treatment options may include anticonvulsant medications, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery[1][5].\n\nIt is important that you continue to advocate for yourself and ensure your healthcare providers take your symptoms seriously. Given the potential impact on your quality of life, it is crucial to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

        "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the various opinions from your doctors, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Seizure-Like Symptoms\n- The symptoms you described, such as uncontrollable movements all over your body, being conscious throughout the episodes, and feeling mentally impaired but able to communicate, could be indicative of **focal aware seizures** (also known as focal onset aware or simple partial seizures)[1][3][5].\n  - Focal aware seizures typically involve movements, feelings, or sensations that are out of the person's control, and they usually last less than 2 minutes, though they can sometimes last longer.\n  - The fact that you are conscious and can communicate, albeit with effort, aligns with the characteristics of focal aware seizures.\n\n## Medication Side Effects\n- Your current medication combination includes Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. Both of these medications have been associated with an increased risk of seizures.\n  - Wellbutrin (bupropion) can lower the seizure threshold, particularly at higher doses, and in people with certain risk factors such as previous head injuries or use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold[2][4][5].\n  - Cymbalta (duloxetine) also has a reported risk of seizures, although it is less commonly highlighted compared to Wellbutrin[2].\n\n## Other Symptoms\n- **Extreme Fatigue**: This could be related to several factors including your depression, potential sleep disorders, or other underlying conditions. The suspicion of narcolepsy was not fully investigated, so it might still be worth exploring.\n- **Painful Joints and Other Symptoms**: These could be indicative of an autoimmune disorder like lupus, as suggested by your rheumatologist. The pending blood tests (ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4) will help clarify this.\n- **Mouth Sores, Dry Chapped Lips, Hair Loss**: These symptoms can be associated with various conditions including autoimmune diseases, nutritional deficiencies, or side effects of medications.\n\n## Diagnostic Considerations\n- Despite the EEG showing no epileptic activity, focal seizures can sometimes not be detected on a single EEG, especially if the seizures are infrequent or if the EEG was not conducted during a seizure event.\n- The normal brain CT and blood tests do not rule out the possibility of seizures or other neurological conditions.\n- The pending autoimmune tests will help determine if you have an autoimmune condition like lupus.\n\n## Next Steps\n- It would be beneficial to have a comprehensive neurological evaluation, possibly including a longer-term EEG or video-EEG monitoring to capture seizure activity if it occurs.\n- Discuss your medication regimen with your doctors to assess whether adjusting your medications could help mitigate the seizure-like symptoms.\n- Complete the suggested blood work for autoimmune markers to rule out conditions like lupus.\n- Consider consulting a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy or movement disorders to get a more focused opinion on your seizure-like symptoms.\n\nGiven the complexity and variability of your symptoms, a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, rheumatology, and psychiatry may help in reaching a definitive diagnosis and managing your condition effectively."

        "question": "I\u2019m 25 with seizures, been seizure free for about 5 years, I\u2019m on 200mg twice a day medication is lamotrigne, I\u2019m a heavy smoker I\u2019m a female I weigh 139lbs I\u2019m 5\u20196. Can I take shrooms?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Considering your medical history and current medication, it is crucial to approach the idea of taking psilocybin (shrooms) with caution. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Interaction with Lamotrigine\n- There is limited research on the specific interactions between psilocybin and lamotrigine. However, a study analyzing online reports found that in most cases, lamotrigine did not significantly impact the psychedelic experience of psilocybin. In about 65% of the reports, lamotrigine was not described as affecting the psychedelic experience, while in some cases, the effect was decreased or intensified without a negative valence[3,.\n\n## Seizure History\n- Given your history of seizures, it is important to note that psilocybin can potentially affect brain activity, although there is no direct evidence that it increases the risk of seizures. However, any alteration in brain chemistry could theoretically pose a risk, especially in individuals with a history of seizure disorders.\n\n## General Safety Considerations\n- Psilocybin acts primarily on the serotonin system, which could interact with other medications that affect serotonin levels. Lamotrigine, while primarily a mood stabilizer, can have various effects on neurotransmitter systems, but it is not typically known for significant interactions with serotonin in the same way SSRIs do[2][3].\n\n## Medical Supervision\n- It is highly advisable to consult your healthcare provider before considering the use of psilocybin or any other psychedelic substance. Your doctor can provide personalized advice based on your specific medical history and current treatment plan.\n\n## Potential Risks\n- While the direct interaction between lamotrigine and psilocybin may not be well-documented, the overall context of your health, including your seizure history and current medication regimen, suggests that caution is warranted. Sudden changes in medication or the introduction of new substances can have unforeseen effects[3][5].\n\nIn summary, while there is no conclusive evidence to strictly prohibit the use of psilocybin with lamotrigine, the lack of comprehensive research and your medical history make it essential to consult with your healthcare provider before making any decisions. They can help assess the potential risks and benefits and provide guidance tailored to your specific situation."

        "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy\u2014frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your diagnosis of epilepsy and the subsequent development of osteoporosis, several factors and associations are worth considering:\n\n## Epilepsy and Osteoporosis Association\nThere is a well-documented association between epilepsy and an increased risk of osteoporosis. Studies have shown that individuals with epilepsy have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, which is linked to both the condition itself and the use of antiseizure medications (ASMs)[1][3][5].\n\n## Antiseizure Medications (ASMs)\nASMs, particularly enzyme-inducing ASMs (eiASMs) and non-eiASMs, have been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. These medications can affect vitamin D metabolism and bone turnover, leading to reduced bone density and increased fracture risk. Even though you mentioned you have been on Lexapro for depression, the introduction of ASMs for your epilepsy could be a significant factor in your bone health issues[1][3][5].\n\n## Seizure Activity and Falls\nSeizure activity itself can increase the risk of falls and fractures, which may contribute to the bone fragility you are experiencing. The fact that you have focal-aware seizures could mean that while you are aware during the seizures, you might still be at risk for falls or other injuries that could lead to fractures[5].\n\n## Lack of Identifiable Cause\nDespite extensive testing, if no other underlying causes for your osteoporosis have been identified, it is plausible that the combination of your epilepsy and the necessary medications are the primary contributors. The literature suggests that the mechanisms behind this association are multifactorial, including the effects of ASMs on bone metabolism and the increased risk of falls due to seizures[1][3][5].\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Vitamin D and Calcium Supplements**: Considering the impact of ASMs on vitamin D metabolism, your neurologist or endocrinologist may recommend vitamin D and calcium supplements to help maintain bone health[3].\n- **Bone Density Monitoring**: Regular bone density scans can help monitor the progression of osteoporosis and the effectiveness of any preventive or therapeutic measures[3].\n- **Fall Prevention**: Strategies to reduce the risk of falls, such as modifying your environment and ensuring safety measures during seizures, can also be beneficial[5].\n\nGiven your otherwise healthy lifestyle and the absence of other risk factors for osteoporosis, it is reasonable to conclude that your epilepsy and the associated antiseizure medications are likely significant contributors to your bone health issues. Continuing to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your epilepsy and monitor your bone health is crucial."

        "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the recent onset of absent moments and the first tonic-clonic seizure, it is prudent to exercise caution when considering travel, especially to a remote location. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Medical Stability and Safety\n- Since your son has just experienced his first tonic-clonic seizure and you are awaiting a diagnosis and potential treatment, it is crucial to prioritize his medical stability. Traveling, especially to a remote area, could increase the risk of complications if another seizure occurs and immediate medical help is not readily available[4].\n\n## Access to Medical Care\n- The remote location of your destination means that access to medical care could be delayed, which is a significant concern given the uncertainty of his current medical condition. Ensuring he has immediate access to medical facilities is vital, especially during the initial stages of diagnosis and treatment[1][4].\n\n## Travel Stress and Triggers\n- Travel, particularly across different time zones and with potential sleep deprivation, can be a trigger for seizures. This could exacerbate his condition and increase the likelihood of another seizure[1][4][5].\n\n## Preparation and Support\n- If you do decide to travel, it would be wise to travel with someone who is aware of his condition and knows how to respond in case of a seizure. Having a seizure response plan, carrying essential medications (if prescribed), and informing your accommodation and any tour groups about his condition are also important[1][4].\n\n## Consult with Healthcare Provider\n- Before making any final decisions, it would be advisable to consult with the paediatrician as soon as possible, even if it means an urgent appointment. They can provide guidance based on your son\u2019s specific condition and help you assess the risks associated with travel[4].\n\nGiven these considerations, cancelling the trip or postponing it until you have a better understanding of your son's condition and any necessary treatment might be the most prudent decision. This approach ensures his safety and allows you to manage his health more effectively.\n\n### Additional Steps\n- While waiting for the appointment, ensure your son's environment is seizure-proofed as much as possible to reduce the risk of injury if another seizure occurs[5].\n- Keep a detailed log of any further episodes or symptoms to share with the healthcare provider, which can help in the diagnosis and treatment planning.\n- Consider wearing a medical alert bracelet and carrying a medical ID card to provide critical information in case of an emergency[1][4]."

        "answer": "Given your situation, here are the likely next steps and potential causes for the blood in your urine:\n\n## Types of Hematuria\nYou are experiencing microscopic hematuria, as the blood is only visible under a microscope and not to the naked eye[1][4][5].\n\n## Potential Causes\nDespite your age, there are several potential causes for hematuria that are not limited to UTIs or kidney stones:\n\n### Infections\nAlthough your initial urinalysis did not show signs of infection, it is still a possibility. However, given the absence of other symptoms like pain, frequent urination, or fever, this seems less likely[1][2][4].\n\n### Kidney Stones\nKidney stones could be a cause, especially if you were experiencing back pain. However, stones often cause significant pain and other symptoms like nausea or vomiting, which you have not mentioned[1][2][4].\n\n### Other Possible Causes\n- **Enlarged Prostate**: This is less likely in your case since you are female.\n- **Kidney Disease**: Conditions such as glomerulonephritis or other kidney diseases can cause hematuria without other symptoms[1][2][5].\n- **Inherited Illnesses**: Sickle cell anemia, Alport syndrome, or polycystic kidney disease (PKD) could be causes, though they are less common[1][3][5].\n- **Medications**: Some medications can cause hematuria, but the ones you are taking (lithium, buspirone, lamictal) are not commonly associated with this side effect[2][3].\n- **Exercise**: Vigorous exercise or sports activities can cause transient hematuria, but this is usually self-limiting[2][3][5].\n- **Injuries**: Any recent injuries to the kidneys or urinary tract could be a cause[3][5].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven that you cannot see your doctor for a couple of weeks, here are some steps you can consider:\n\n### Monitoring\nContinue to monitor your symptoms and urine output. If you notice any changes in the color of your urine, increased pain, or other symptoms such as fever, nausea, or frequent urination, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n### Follow-Up Testing\nWhen you see your doctor, they may order additional tests to determine the cause of the hematuria:\n- **Imaging Tests**: Such as a CT scan or ultrasound to check for kidney stones or other structural issues[1][2][4].\n- **Cystoscopy**: To examine the interior of your bladder and urethra[1][4].\n- **Blood Tests**: To check for signs of kidney disease or other systemic conditions[1][2][5].\n\n### Questions to Ask Your Doctor\nWhen you do see your doctor, you may want to ask:\n- Why the blood in my urine is persistent despite no other symptoms.\n- What additional tests are necessary to determine the cause.\n- How often your urine should be checked to ensure the hematuria resolves.\n- If you should follow up with a nephrologist for further evaluation[5].\n\nIt is important not to ignore persistent hematuria, even if you are asymptomatic, as it could be an early sign of a more serious condition."

        "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While your previous check at 15 did not indicate epilepsy, the symptoms you experienced recently could be worth further investigation, but they do not necessarily point to epilepsy as the primary cause. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n## Sensory Triggers\nExposure to bright and fast lights can trigger various reactions, especially in individuals with sensory sensitivities. This could be related to subjective sensory sensitivity, which is a common experience in several neurological and neurodiverse conditions, but it is not exclusive to epilepsy[2].\n\n## Symptoms Described\nYour symptoms, such as shaking, vomiting, dizziness, feeling cold and numb, and the duration of these symptoms, do not perfectly align with typical seizure presentations. Here are a few types of seizures and their usual symptoms:\n\n- **Generalized Seizures**: These include tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and others. Tonic-clonic seizures, for example, involve a loss of consciousness followed by stiffness and jerking movements, which is different from your symptoms[1][5].\n- **Focal Seizures**: These can involve various symptoms depending on the brain area affected, such as sensory changes, motor movements, or changes in consciousness. However, the specific combination of symptoms you described does not closely match the typical presentations of focal seizures[3][5].\n\n## Other Possible Causes\nGiven your exposure to bright and fast lights, it is possible that you experienced a different type of reaction, such as:\n- **Photogenic or Photosensitive Reaction**: Some people can experience seizures triggered by specific visual stimuli, but this would typically involve more characteristic seizure symptoms.\n- **Other Neurological or Sensory Issues**: Conditions like migraines, sensory processing disorders, or even anxiety reactions could explain your symptoms.\n- **Hormonal Issues**: Since you mentioned problems with your hormones and are taking medication for it, hormonal imbalances could contribute to your symptoms, although this would not explain the immediate reaction to bright lights.\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven the unusual nature of your symptoms and their trigger, it would be wise to consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. Here are some steps you might consider:\n\n- **Consult a Neurologist**: Discuss your recent episode with a neurologist to rule out any new onset of epilepsy or other neurological conditions.\n- **Comprehensive Medical Check**: Ensure that your hormonal treatment is not contributing to these symptoms and check for any other underlying conditions that might be causing them.\n- **Sensory Sensitivity Evaluation**: If you suspect sensory sensitivities, discuss this with a healthcare provider who can provide further evaluation and advice on managing such sensitivities.\n\nA detailed medical evaluation will help determine the exact cause of your symptoms and guide appropriate treatment."

        "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation with a Chiari type 1 malformation, here are some points to consider:\n\n### Life Expectancy and Seizures\n- The presence of uncontrolled seizures can potentially impact your quality of life and may pose risks, but Chiari type 1 malformation itself is generally not life-threatening and does not typically shorten life expectancy[1][4][5>.\n- However, uncontrolled seizures, especially those leading to aspiration and other severe complications, do increase the risk of mortality and morbidity. It is crucial to manage these seizures effectively.\n\n### Spinal Decompression Surgery\n- You may be a candidate for spinal decompression surgery, which is often recommended for patients with Chiari type 1 malformation who experience significant symptoms, including those related to syringomyelia (like in your case)[2][4].\n- This surgery involves decompressing the area around the cerebellar tonsils to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and brainstem. It can help alleviate symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, numbness, and tingling, and may also help reduce the size of a syrinx.\n\n### Impact on Epilepsy\n- While spinal decompression surgery is primarily aimed at relieving pressure on the spinal cord and brainstem, there is limited evidence to suggest it directly controls epilepsy. Your seizures appear to be originating from the frontal lobe (specifically Broca's area), which might not be directly related to the Chiari malformation itself[2][4].\n- However, managing the underlying Chiari malformation and syringomyelia could potentially improve overall neurological function, which might have some indirect benefits or reduce the frequency of seizures, though this would need to be discussed with your neurosurgeon and neurologist.\n\n### SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy)\n- Given your history of uncontrolled seizures, especially those severe enough to require ICU intervention, the risk of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is a concern. It is essential to work closely with your neurologist to optimize your seizure management and reduce this risk[4%.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Consult a Neurosurgeon:** Discuss the possibility of spinal decompression surgery with a neurosurgeon to see if it could alleviate some of your symptoms, including the syrinx.\n- **Neurological Evaluation:** Continue to work with your neurologist to optimize your seizure management. This might involve adjusting your medications, considering other treatment options like vagus nerve stimulation, or evaluating for other potential causes of your seizures.\n- **Multidisciplinary Care:** Given the complexity of your condition, it may be beneficial to seek care at a center that offers multidisciplinary management of Chiari malformations and epilepsy.\n- **Support System:** It's important to have a strong support system, especially given the challenges you're facing. Consider seeking help from family, friends, or support groups to manage the emotional and psychological aspects of your condition.\n\nIn summary, while your life expectancy is not necessarily shortened by the Chiari type 1 malformation itself, the uncontrolled seizures do pose significant risks. Addressing both the Chiari malformation and the epilepsy through surgical and medical interventions, along with a strong support system, will be crucial for managing your condition effectively."

        "answer": "Given your concerns about your mother's memory decline and her long history of epilepsy, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Epilepsy and Memory Issues\nEpilepsy, particularly when it involves seizures, can significantly impact memory. Here are a few ways this can happen:\n\n### Seizure Impact\nSeizures, including tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, can affect memory in several stages:\n- **Before a seizure**: Memories formed before the seizure might not be stored properly.\n- **During a seizure**: Loss of consciousness can prevent the brain from recording and storing memories.\n- **After a seizure**: Post-seizure confusion can disrupt memory function[4].\n\n### Interictal Activity\nBetween seizures, abnormal electrical activity in the brain, such as interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), can disrupt memory and attention. This activity can temporarily change the firing of individual brain cells, especially in areas like the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory[1].\n\n### Temporal Lobe Involvement\nWhile tonic-clonic seizures are generalized and not focal, they can still have indirect effects on the temporal lobe. However, the most direct damage to the temporal lobe is typically associated with focal seizures, such as those seen in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Repeated focal seizures can lead to cognitive impairment characteristic of temporal lobe dysfunction and can spread to other brain regions, affecting multiple cognitive functions[5].\n\n## Correlation with Dementia\nThere is evidence that people with epilepsy, especially those with focal seizures, are at a higher risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. This risk is partly due to the cumulative damage from seizures and the underlying brain pathology. However, this correlation is more established for focal epilepsy rather than generalized seizures like tonic-clonic seizures[3].\n\n## Age and Memory Decline\nAt 60 years old, some degree of memory decline is expected due to normal aging, but the extent of your mother's memory issues seems excessive. It is crucial to distinguish between normal aging and potential pathological causes.\n\n## Other Factors\nSeveral other factors could be contributing to your mother's memory issues:\n- **Medical History**: Her history of estrogen-binding cancer, double mastectomy, hysterectomy, and other medical conditions (e.g., fractured neck, hip replacement, nerve pain) could have cumulative effects.\n- **Medications**: Both epilepsy and depression medications, such as lamotrigine and lexapro, can have side effects that impact memory and cognitive function[4].\n- **Family History**: The significant family history of mental illness might also play a role, although this is less directly linked to her current memory issues.\n- **Past Substance Use**: Any history of substance use, even if brief, could have long-term cognitive effects.\n\n## Steps to Take\n\n### Consult a Specialist\nIt is essential to consult with her neurologist or an epilepsy specialist to assess the impact of her seizures and medications on her memory. They can adjust her treatment plan if necessary.\n\n### Neuropsychological Assessment\nA neuropsychological assessment can help determine the extent of her memory problems and identify specific areas of cognitive difficulty. This can be conducted by a psychologist and will help in developing strategies to manage her memory issues[4].\n\n### Cognitive Rehabilitation\nCognitive rehabilitation programs, which may involve occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, or physiotherapists, can help her work on key goals to improve her memory and overall cognitive function.\n\n### Emotional Wellbeing\nGiven her history of clinical depression and the family history of mental illness, ensuring her emotional wellbeing is crucial. This might involve ongoing mental health support and managing stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\n### Support and Comfort\nMaking your mother feel loved and comfortable involves:\n- **Open Communication**: Talk to her about your concerns in a supportive manner.\n- **Practical Help**: Assist her with daily tasks and memory aids (e.g., reminders, lists).\n- **Encouragement**: Encourage her to stay engaged in activities she enjoys, which can help maintain cognitive function.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, you can help manage her memory issues and improve her overall quality of life."

Sleep seizures during the depression but they are gone now.Thanks for any input.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the symptoms you're experiencing, here are some potential explanations and considerations:\n\n## Eye Shaking (Nystagmus)\nThe eye shaking or nystagmus you experience upon waking, particularly after poor sleep, could be due to several factors:\n- **Sleep Deprivation**: As mentioned, sleep deprivation can affect muscle control and overall physical stability. It's possible that your muscles are indeed straining due to exhaustion, leading to the eye shaking[2][5].\n- **Medication Side Effects**: Some of your medications, such as Epitol (carbamazepine), which is used to treat epilepsy, can have side effects like dizziness, blurred vision, or other ocular disturbances. These side effects might be exacerbated by sleep deprivation[3].\n- **Underlying Neurological Conditions**: Given your history of epilepsy and mixed results for MS, it's also possible that the eye shaking could be related to an underlying neurological condition. However, without a clear diagnosis of MS, it's speculative to attribute this symptom directly to MS.\n\n## Sleep and Epilepsy\nYour history of sleep seizures, which have since stopped, indicates that your sleep patterns and epilepsy are closely linked. Sleep deprivation is known to increase the risk of seizures in people with epilepsy, and poor sleep quality can disrupt normal brain activity, potentially leading to various symptoms including nystagmus[2][5].\n\n## Systemic Scleroderma\nWhile systemic scleroderma primarily affects the skin and internal organs, it can also have broader systemic effects. However, eye shaking is not a typical symptom directly associated with scleroderma. Your primary symptoms related to scleroderma, such as skin changes and potential internal organ involvement, should be monitored separately[1][4].\n\n## Medication and Sleep\nYour current medication regimen, including Epitol, Tylenol, Flexeril, and Mirtazapine, can impact your sleep quality and may contribute to the symptoms you're experiencing. For example:\n- **Epitol (Carbamazepine)**: Can affect sleep patterns and cause dizziness or other neurological side effects.\n- **Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine)**: A muscle relaxant that can make you drowsy but may also affect sleep quality if taken irregularly.\n- **Mirtazapine**: An antidepressant that can help with sleep but may also have side effects that impact your overall physical condition[3].\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Consult Your Neurologist**: Discuss your eye shaking symptom with your neurologist to rule out any new or worsening neurological conditions.\n- **Sleep Hygiene**: Focus on improving your sleep quality, as better sleep can reduce the risk of seizures and other symptoms. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding stimulants before bedtime, and creating a sleep-conducive environment[2][5].\n- **Medication Review**: Review your medication regimen with your healthcare provider to ensure that your current medications are not exacerbating your symptoms.\n- **Multidisciplinary Care**: Given your multiple conditions, it may be beneficial to have a multidisciplinary care team that includes a rheumatologist, neurologist, and a primary care physician to manage all aspects of your health."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your concerns and the symptoms you are describing, it is crucial to seek a thorough re-evaluation of your diagnosis. Here are some key points and steps you can consider:\n\n### Differential Diagnosis Between Tics and Seizures\n\n- **Tics vs. Myoclonic Seizures:**\n  - Tics, as seen in Tourette syndrome, are typically preceded by an urge or uncomfortable sensation that is relieved by the tic. You mentioned a feeling of electricity in the back of your head, but it does not seem to be associated with an urge to perform the movement[1][3][4].\n  - Myoclonic seizures, particularly those associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), involve sudden jerks without loss of consciousness. These jerks often occur in the morning and can be triggered by various factors, including sleep deprivation and stress[1].\n  - The fact that your head jerks are accompanied by a grunting sound and occur involuntarily, especially when you are stressed or not sleeping well, suggests they could be seizure-related rather than tics.\n\n### Key Symptoms to Discuss\n\n- **Involuntary Movements:** You described head jerks and grunting sounds that are involuntary, which could be indicative of myoclonic seizures.\n- **Trigger Factors:** The worsening of symptoms when you are off your medication, sleep-deprived, or stressed could be consistent with seizure activity.\n- **Absence of Consciousness Loss:** While you mentioned never forgetting or losing consciousness during these episodes, it's important to note that myoclonic seizures typically do not involve a loss of consciousness[1].\n\n### Steps to Take\n\n1. **Consult Your GP:**\n   - Discuss your concerns with your GP during your upcoming appointment. Explain the specific symptoms you are experiencing, including the head jerks, grunting sounds, and the sensation in the back of your head. Emphasize the involuntary nature of these movements and how they are affected by your sleep and medication[1][3].\n\n2. **Seek a Second Neurological Opinion:**\n   - If your GP agrees that there could be a misdiagnosis, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist. This specialist can perform or recommend additional tests such as video-EEG monitoring to help differentiate between tics and seizures[1][2][4].\n\n3. **Detailed Medical History:**\n   - Ensure that your medical history, including the timing and triggers of your symptoms, is thoroughly documented. This will help the new neurologist make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\n4. **Reevaluation of Medication:**\n   - Your current medication regimen includes Topamax (topiramate), which is often used for treating epilepsy and sometimes for migraines and other conditions. If your symptoms are more likely seizures, your medication might need to be adjusted. For example, valproic acid is commonly used for treating myoclonic epilepsy[1].\n\n5. **Psychological and Behavioral Assessment:**\n   - Since you also have bipolar disorder and OCD, it is important to assess how these conditions might interact with your current symptoms. However, the primary focus should be on distinguishing between tics and seizures to ensure proper treatment.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can work towards a more accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for your condition."

        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the symptoms you're describing, it's important to consider several factors that could be contributing to your exhaustion and other symptoms.\n\n### Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Fatigue\nMS-related fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom, affecting approximately 80% of people with MS. This type of fatigue is not relieved by sleep, worsens as the day progresses, and can be exacerbated by heat and humidity. It is described as a heavy tiredness, general weakness, or lack of energy, and can be both physical and mental[1][5].\n\n### Diabetes and Medications\nYour diabetes management, including medications like Jardiance and insulin, could also play a role. While these medications are crucial for managing diabetes, they can sometimes contribute to fatigue, especially if your blood sugar levels are not well-controlled. Additionally, some diabetes medications may have side effects that include fatigue[4].\n\n### Other Medical Conditions\n- **Epilepsy**: Certain medications for epilepsy can cause fatigue as a side effect.\n- **Digestive Issues**: These can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, which may contribute to fatigue.\n- **Undiagnosed Liver Problems**: Liver issues can cause significant fatigue due to the liver's critical role in metabolism and detoxification.\n- **Recent Overdose**: This could have led to a temporary increase in fatigue and other symptoms due to the body's stress response and potential organ damage.\n\n### General Health and Comfort\n- **Pain and Discomfort**: The pain and discomfort from your various conditions can make even simple activities like moving your arm or speaking extremely exhausting.\n- **Need to Lie Down**: This could be due to the cumulative effect of your conditions, including MS fatigue, which often requires frequent rest[5].\n\n### Upcoming Tests\nThe electromyography and heart tests will help identify any additional issues, such as muscle or cardiac problems, that might be contributing to your fatigue and pain.\n\n### Immediate Steps\n- **Consult Your Healthcare Provider**: It is crucial to discuss your current symptoms with your healthcare provider to adjust your treatment plan if necessary. They can help manage your medications, address any potential side effects, and provide guidance on managing your fatigue.\n- **Pain Management**: Ensure that your pain is adequately managed, as uncontrolled pain can significantly exacerbate fatigue.\n- **Rest and Support**: Continue to rest as needed and seek support from family and friends to help with daily tasks.\n\nGiven the complexity of your health conditions, a comprehensive approach from your healthcare team will be essential in managing your fatigue and overall well-being."

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what?

        "answer": "Given the complex and specific nature of your symptoms, it is crucial to consider several potential causes and to seek a thorough medical evaluation.\n\n### Neurosarcoidosis\n- Your symptoms, such as the involuntary eye closure, strange sensations, leg spasms, tingling in the hands, facial twitching, and numbness, could be indicative of neurosarcoidosis. This condition involves the nervous system and can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including those you described[1].\n\n### Lymphoma\n- The presence of an enlarged hilar lymph node, even if the needle biopsy was negative, suggests that lymphoma could still be a consideration. Lymphoma can cause neurological symptoms if it spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) or if it compresses nerves. The symptoms you described, such as seizures, numbness, and weakness, can occur in CNS lymphoma[4][5].\n\n### Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS)\n- While less likely, ALPS could also be considered given the lymph node enlargement and neurological symptoms. However, ALPS typically presents with autoimmune destruction of blood cells and lymphoproliferation, which does not exactly match your current symptoms[3].\n\n### Other Considerations\n- **Psychogenic Seizures**: The attending neurologist's suggestion of psychogenic seizures seems premature without further investigation, especially given the complexity and repetition of your symptoms. Psychogenic seizures typically do not follow such a consistent and complex pattern.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Insist on Further Investigation**: Given the severity and repetition of your symptoms, it is important to press for a more thorough evaluation. This could include:\n   - Advanced imaging (MRI, CT scans) to rule out any structural issues in the brain or spinal cord.\n   - Additional biopsies or samples from the lymph node if the initial biopsy was inconclusive.\n   - Comprehensive neurological exams and tests, such as electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies, to assess nerve function.\n   - Blood tests to check for autoimmune markers or other conditions that could explain your symptoms.\n\n2. **Second Opinion**: Considering the dismissive attitude of the attending neurologist, seeking a second opinion from a specialist, such as a neurologist with expertise in sarcoidosis or neurological manifestations of lymphoma, might be beneficial.\n\n3. **Monitor and Document Symptoms**: Continue to document your symptoms, including any videos or detailed descriptions, to provide as much information as possible to your healthcare providers.\n\nGiven the urgency and complexity of your situation, it is crucial to advocate for a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms."

        "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms your son is experiencing, such as tremors since infancy, a past seizure, and recent episodes of closing his eyes and shaking his head, could be indicative of several conditions. Here are some possibilities to consider:\n\n## Shuddering Attacks\nShuddering attacks are brief, involuntary movements that can involve the head and upper extremities, and they do not impair consciousness. These episodes can be mistaken for seizures but are generally benign and do not require antiepileptic medications. They often resolve on their own with age and are characterized by normal neurologic examination and EEG findings[3].\n\n## Focal Onset Seizures\nAlthough the EEG did not indicate epilepsy, it is still possible for your son to experience focal onset seizures, which can manifest in various ways. For instance, focal onset aware seizures can involve motor symptoms like twitching or jerking, and non-motor symptoms such as sensory changes or altered perceptions. However, these seizures usually involve more specific and localized symptoms depending on the brain area affected[5].\n\n## Other Neurological Conditions\n- **Infantile Tremor Syndrome (ITS):** This condition is characterized by tremors, anemia, and other symptoms, but it typically resolves within a few weeks to months. However, this is less likely if the tremors have been persistent since infancy[4].\n\n- **Vitamin Deficiencies:** Vitamin D deficiency, for example, can cause tremors and shudders in newborns and infants. Other nutritional deficiencies, such as Vitamin B12, could also be a factor[1][4].\n\n## Recent Episodes\nThe recent behavior of closing his eyes and shaking his head could be related to several factors:\n- **Shuddering Attacks:** As mentioned, these are benign and not indicative of epilepsy.\n- **Focal Onset Seizures:** If these episodes are associated with any of the symptoms described (e.g., twitching, altered sensations), it might suggest a focal onset seizure, although the EEG did not support this.\n- **Other Causes:** It could also be a reaction to something irritative, such as a sour taste, or even a behavioral response rather than a neurological symptom.\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven the complexity and the history of your son's symptoms, it is crucial to continue working closely with his neurologist. Here are some steps to consider:\n- **Detailed Observation:** Videotaping the episodes can help differentiate between shuddering attacks and other conditions.\n- **Further Testing:** Even though an EEG was conducted, further evaluations or repeat testing might be necessary to rule out other conditions.\n- **Comprehensive Examination:** Ensure that his neurologist conducts a thorough physical and neurological examination to look for any underlying conditions that might be contributing to these symptoms.\n\nIt is unlikely that teething would cause such specific and recurring episodes of shaking his head and closing his eyes. Consulting with the neurologist to discuss these new symptoms in detail will help in determining the best course of action."

        "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the EEG results you described, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## EEG Findings\n\n- The EEG was conducted with 19 convexity electrodes, using a 24-channel system, both in bi- and monopolar configurations. The test was done at rest, with hyperventilation (HV), and under flickering light.\n- **At Rest:**\n  - There is moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable background activity around 10 Hz (alpha waves) in the posterior regions of the brain, with slower interrupting waves and occasional faster-frequency beta waves. This activity spreads to centroparietal and temporal areas.\n  - The background activity is predominant over central and temporal brain areas, with low voltage frontal activity.\n  - Discontinuous dysrhythmias are observed regionally, particularly in the left temporal, mid-frontotemporal, and frontal brain regions (maximum at T3-F7, F3-FP1). Isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes are also noted.\n  - The background activity shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids[1][3][4].\n\n## Interpretation\n\n- **Dysrhythmias and Sharp Wave Complexes:** The presence of discontinuous dysrhythmias and sharp wave complexes, especially in the temporal and frontal regions, can be indicative of epileptiform activity. These findings are often associated with epilepsy, particularly focal or partial epilepsy[1][3][4].\n\n- **Reactivity and Activation:** The background activity's incomplete reactivity to eyelid opening and closing and the slight activation under hyperventilation suggest some abnormal brain wave patterns that could be related to epilepsy or other neurological conditions[1][3].\n\n- **No Activation Under Flickering Light:** The absence of activation signs under flickering light does not rule out epilepsy but suggests that the specific stimuli used did not trigger any notable abnormal activity during the test[1].\n\n## Clinical Implications\n\n- Your symptoms of episodic fatigue, disorientation, concentration difficulties, trembling/shivering, and a general feeling of weirdness could be related to various neurological conditions, including epilepsy. However, these symptoms alone are not definitive for epilepsy.\n- The EEG findings, particularly the dysrhythmias and sharp wave complexes, suggest that epilepsy could be a possibility, but a definitive diagnosis requires further evaluation by an epilepsy specialist.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- It is crucial to follow up with the epilepsy specialist as recommended. They will interpret the EEG in the context of your clinical history and symptoms.\n- Additional tests such as MRI, ECG, blood tests, or genetic testing might be recommended to rule out other conditions and to confirm the diagnosis[1][3].\n\nGiven the complexity of EEG interpretation and the need for specialized expertise, it is wise to rely on the opinion of the epilepsy specialist who will have a more comprehensive understanding of your overall clinical picture."

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",

        "answer": "Given your complex medical profile, including chronic primary insomnia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and mild depression, here are some key considerations and potential adjustments to your treatment plan:\n\n## Insomnia and GAD Treatment\n- It is crucial to treat insomnia concurrently with, but independently of, the anxiety disorder. Studies have shown that targeted insomnia treatment can improve both insomnia and anxiety symptoms. For instance, the use of hypnotics like eszopiclone or zolpidem in combination with antidepressants (e.g., escitalopram) can significantly improve insomnia and may also enhance the anxiolytic response[1].\n- Given your reliance on Trazodone and occasional use of Klonopin, it might be beneficial to explore other options with fewer interactions and risks. Ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, has been shown to be effective for insomnia in patients with GAD and has a lower risk of abuse and tolerance[1].\n\n## Drug Interactions and Seizure Risk\n- The combination of Trazodone, Wellbutrin, and Adderall does pose a risk of lowering the seizure threshold. Although you do not have a history of seizures, this is a significant concern that should be monitored closely. Your psychiatrist should regularly assess this risk and consider alternative medications that minimize these interactions.\n- Non-pharmacological approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) could be beneficial and reduce the need for multiple medications with potential interactions[1].\n\n## Management of ADHD and Depression\n- For ADHD, your current use of Adderall seems effective, but it's important to monitor the heart rate and blood pressure, especially given your high resting heart rate.\n- For depression, Wellbutrin is often a good choice, especially since you have found it more tolerable than other options like Lexapro. However, the combination with other medications should be closely monitored due to the potential for increased seizure risk[5].\n\n## Alternative Therapies\n- Consider incorporating behavioral therapies like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or CBT-I to manage your symptoms more holistically. DBT can be particularly beneficial for managing acute distress and improving emotional regulation, which is helpful in both ADHD and depression[5].\n\n## Monitoring and Adjustments\n- Regularly review your medication regimen with your psychiatrist to ensure it remains safe and effective. Given your medical background and self-awareness, your active involvement in this process is beneficial.\n- Be cautious with the use of Klonopin, as benzodiazepines can lead to dependence and have other adverse effects, particularly in individuals with a history of substance use. Alternative anxiolytics or non-pharmacological strategies may be more sustainable long-term solutions[1].\n\n## Orthostatic Hypotension\n- If you experience symptoms suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, ensure you are well-hydrated and consider other lifestyle adjustments to mitigate these episodes. This could also be related to the medications you are taking, so monitoring and adjusting your medication schedule may help.\n\nIn summary, while your current regimen has been manageable, it is crucial to continue monitoring the interactions and risks associated with your medications. Exploring alternative treatments and therapies, and maintaining a close relationship with your psychiatrist to adjust your treatment plan as needed, will be important for optimizing your care."

        "question": "I have been diagnosed with Ped Mal seizures since I was young. It has been triggered at times due to various reasons however those reasons have never been gaming. I ran into a game that gave a warning for Photosensitive epilepsy for its intense flashing however I play many games that have intense flashing but haven't had a episode. I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While you have not experienced seizures triggered by gaming in the past, it is crucial to approach this situation with caution, especially given the specific warning for photosensitive epilepsy in the game you're considering.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n## Photosensitive Epilepsy\nEven though only about 3% to 5% of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy, the warning in the game indicates that it contains elements that could potentially trigger seizures in those who are sensitive to flashing lights or high contrasting patterns[1][3][4].\n\n## Personal History and Current Medication\nYou have been diagnosed with Ped Mal (presumably meaning 'Partial Mal' or partial seizures, possibly referring to a type of epilepsy like temporal lobe epilepsy) and are currently on lamotrigine, which has been effective in controlling your seizures. However, this does not necessarily mean you are immune to photosensitive triggers, especially if you have not been tested specifically for photosensitive epilepsy[1][3].\n\n## Precautions\nTo play the game safely, consider the following precautions:\n\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: Talk to your epilepsy specialist about your concerns. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition and the effectiveness of your current medication[1].\n- **Photosensitive Epilepsy Test**: If you haven't already, you might want to undergo a test to determine if you have photosensitive epilepsy. This can help you understand your risk level better[1][3].\n- **Game Settings**: Check if the game allows you to adjust settings to reduce or eliminate flashing lights. Some games offer options to turn off strobe effects or reduce visual intensity[1][3].\n- **Eye Patch**: Wearing an eye patch can be a precautionary measure for some people with photosensitive epilepsy[1].\n- **Monitoring**: Be aware of how you feel while playing. If you experience any symptoms that could indicate a seizure (e.g., dizziness, nausea, unusual sensations), stop playing immediately and consult your doctor.\n\n## General Advice\nGiven that you have not had seizures triggered by gaming before, you might still be at risk if the game's flashing lights are particularly intense or tailored to trigger photosensitive seizures. It is always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.\n\nIn summary, while your current medication has been effective, it is wise to consult your doctor and consider the precautions mentioned above before playing a game with a warning for photosensitive epilepsy."

        "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, it is crucial to differentiate between several potential causes, including tics associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), seizure activity, and other neurological or behavioral phenomena.\n\n### Tics and ASD\nYour diagnosed motor tics, such as arm and neck twitching and jerking, are common in individuals with ASD. These tics can be exacerbated by stress, anxiety, or fatigue, and may also be influenced by substances like alcohol or recreational drugs[1][2].\n\n### \"Blanking Out\" Spells\nThe episodes where you stare off, become unresponsive, and experience twitching and jerking could be indicative of several things:\n\n#### Seizure Activity\nAlthough you remain conscious and aware of your surroundings, these episodes could be subtle seizure activities, such as:\n- **Absence Seizures (Petit Mal):** Characterized by brief periods of staring and unresponsiveness, often accompanied by slight physical movements like blinking or twitching[4].\n- **Myoclonic Seizures:** Involving brief, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles, which can occur without loss of consciousness[4].\n\nGiven your cousin's history of grand mal seizures triggered by drinking on an empty stomach, there is a possibility that you might be experiencing a form of seizure activity that is less severe but still significant.\n\n#### Sub-Clinical Electrical Discharges\nIndividuals with ASD often have sub-clinical electrical discharges that can be detected on an EEG but may not always result in overt seizure symptoms. These discharges can sometimes be associated with cognitive or behavioral disturbances[4][5].\n\n### Differentiation and Diagnosis\nTo determine whether these episodes are seizures or another condition, it is essential to undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Consult a Neurologist:** A neurologist can evaluate your symptoms and medical history to determine if you need further testing.\n2. **EEG:** An electroencephalogram (EEG) can help identify any abnormal electrical activity in the brain that might be indicative of seizure activity. An extended or 24-hour EEG might be necessary to capture the episodes you are experiencing[4].\n3. **Detailed Medical History:** Provide your doctor with a detailed history of your episodes, including any triggers (like alcohol or sleep disturbances), and any family history of neurological conditions.\n4. **Physical Examination:** A thorough physical examination can help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms.\n\n### Immediate Precautions\nUntil you can consult a neurologist and undergo further evaluation:\n- **Avoid Triggers:** Try to avoid or minimize triggers such as alcohol, especially on an empty stomach, and ensure you maintain a healthy sleep schedule.\n- **Monitor Symptoms:** Keep a log of when these episodes occur and any possible triggers or patterns.\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and the potential overlap with seizure activity, it is not advisable to simply assume you are overthinking. A professional medical evaluation is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, it is crucial to seek a thorough medical evaluation to determine the cause of your episodes. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Distinguishing Between Seizures and Other Conditions\n\n- The episodes you described, such as feeling extremely heavy, electric shock waves, disorganized thoughts, and the inability to move or speak without effort, could be indicative of seizures, particularly focal seizures. Focal seizures can cause a range of symptoms, including altered sensations, emotions, and thoughts, and can often leave the person fully conscious but with impaired ability to respond[1][4].\n- The recurrence of these episodes, especially with triggers like fatigue, fatty/sugary foods, and the consistent feelings of nausea, anxiety, and disorganized thoughts beforehand, suggests a neurological origin rather than simply zoning out or seeking attention.\n\n## Migraine Aura vs. Seizure\n\n- While migraine auras can cause similar symptoms such as disorganized thoughts, heavy eyelids, and visual disturbances, the nature of your episodes, especially the electric shock wave and the repetitive images, is less typical for migraine auras. However, it is still possible that these could be complex migraine auras, and a medical evaluation is necessary to differentiate between the two[1].\n\n## Impact of Medications and Cannabis\n\n- Your current medications, including bupropion, buspirone, and hydroxyzine, can have various side effects, but they are not typically associated with causing seizures directly. However, it is essential to discuss all your medications with your doctor to rule out any potential interactions or side effects.\n- Cannabis, particularly high-potency or synthetic cannabinoids, has been associated with an increased risk of seizures in some studies. While THC itself has not been directly linked to causing seizures, withdrawal and high doses of THC or synthetic cannabinoids like spice and delta-8 can increase the risk of seizures[2][5].\n\n## Other Considerations\n\n- The significant decline in your physical activity and weight loss over the last year could be related to various underlying health issues, including neurological or metabolic conditions.\n- Your occasional dizziness and loss of balance also warrant further investigation.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Given the complexity and potential seriousness of these episodes, it is essential to consult a neurologist for a thorough evaluation. This may include:\n  - Electroencephalography (EEG) to check for seizure activity.\n  - Imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans to rule out structural brain abnormalities.\n  - A detailed review of your medical history, including your current medications and cannabis use.\n  - Possibly, a video EEG monitoring to capture and analyze any future episodes.\n\n## Addressing Concerns About Faking Symptoms\n\n- It is highly unlikely that someone would fake such specific and detailed symptoms, especially when they are causing concern and disruption in daily life. Your concern about whether you are making this up for attention is understandable, but a medical evaluation will help clarify the origin of your symptoms.\n\nTo summarize, while the exact cause of your episodes is not clear from your description alone, they warrant a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine whether they are seizures, complex migraine auras, or another neurological condition. Consulting a neurologist is the best next step."

        "answer": "Given your diagnosis of Episodic Ataxia Type 2 (EA2) and your current treatment regimen, here are some key points to consider regarding the use of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and acetazolamide:\n\n## Efficacy of 4-AP and Acetazolamide\n\nBoth 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), particularly its prolonged-release form known as fampridine, and acetazolamide are recognized as effective treatments for EA2.\n\n- **Fampridine (4-AP):** Studies have shown that fampridine significantly reduces the number of EA2 attacks, with a reduction of 63% compared to placebo[1][5].\n- **Acetazolamide:** This medication also significantly reduces the number of EA2 attacks, with a reduction of 52% compared to placebo[1][5].\n\n## Current Treatment and Side Effects\n\nYou are currently taking acetazolamide (Diamox 500 mg BID) and prednisone (5 mg), which are helping but not entirely resolving your episodes.\n\n- **Acetazolamide Side Effects:** Common side effects include taste disturbances, gastrointestinal complaints, and the potential for kidney stones with long-term use[1][3].\n- **Fampridine Side Effects:** Generally, fampridine has fewer side effects than acetazolamide, with common side effects including tingling paresthesia and fatigue[1][5].\n\n## Transitioning to 4-AP\n\nGiven your current situation, transitioning to fampridine (4-AP) could be a viable option to reduce your reliance on prednisone and potentially manage your EA2 episodes more effectively.\n\n- **Clinical Evidence:** The EAT2TREAT study and other clinical reports support the use of fampridine as a safer and better-tolerated alternative to acetazolamide[1][5].\n\n## Discussion with Your Neurologist\n\nIt would be beneficial to have a detailed discussion with your neurologist about the following points:\n\n- **Prednisone Reduction:** If prednisone is the only medication currently providing relief, it may be prudent to taper off it gradually under medical supervision once you start on fampridine.\n- **Fampridine Initiation:** Request to be started on fampridine, emphasizing the clinical evidence supporting its efficacy and better tolerability compared to acetazolamide.\n- **Movement Clinic Referral:** While a movement clinic might offer additional insights, given the insurance and accessibility issues, it might be reasonable to first try the medication adjustment before pursuing further specialist evaluation.\n\n## Monitoring and Adjustments\n\nWhen starting fampridine, it is crucial to monitor your response and adjust the dosage as needed. Your neurologist should be involved in this process to ensure a smooth transition and to address any emerging side effects.\n\nIn summary, transitioning to fampridine could offer a promising alternative to your current treatment, potentially allowing you to reduce or eliminate your prednisone use while better managing your EA2 episodes. A thorough discussion with your neurologist is essential to implement this change safely and effectively."

        "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ? I feel flooded by these emotions, I cry.Then it took like 15 minutes to come back to normal, I am in a very confused state and go back to sleep.Any idea what was that ?",

        "answer": "The experience you described shares several characteristics that are common in cases of sleep paralysis and related sleep disorders, although some aspects are unique and could be a combination of different factors. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Sleep Paralysis\n- The inability to move or speak, along with hallucinations and a sense of panic or fear, are hallmark symptoms of sleep paralysis[1][4].\n- Your description of feeling a strong instinct to avoid going back to sleep and the sensation of suffocation or losing control over your thoughts aligns with the intense fear and panic often associated with sleep paralysis.\n- The feeling of pressure, inability to breathe properly, and the presence of hallucinations (though you didn't mention specific visual or auditory hallucinations, the disorientation and loss of control over thoughts could be related) are also consistent with sleep paralysis.\n\n## Cognitive Disruption\n- The difficulty in forming complex thoughts and the sensation that your thoughts were \"erasing\" or \"glitching\" could be related to the disorientation and cognitive disruption that can occur during sleep paralysis or when transitioning between sleep and wakefulness[1][4].\n- The \"deafening silent\" voice in your head and the loss of control over your thinking may indicate a transient disruption in normal cognitive processes, which can happen in such states.\n\n## Emotional and Psychological Responses\n- The emotional flooding and the eventual crying could be a result of the intense fear and panic associated with the experience. The fight or flight response is often triggered during sleep paralysis, which can lead to strong emotional reactions[1][4].\n\n## Differentiation from Other Conditions\n- While your experience shares many traits with sleep paralysis, the specific cognitive disruption and the feeling of losing control over your thoughts might also suggest a transient episode of confusion or disorientation upon waking, which can occur in various sleep disorders.\n\nTo better manage such episodes, here are some suggestions:\n- **Improve Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure regular sleep schedules, avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, and create a relaxing sleep environment.\n- **Reduce Stress**: Stress can exacerbate sleep disorders. Engage in stress-reducing activities like meditation or yoga.\n- **Seek Medical Advice**: If these episodes are frequent or distressing, consulting a healthcare provider can help identify any underlying sleep disorders or other conditions that may need attention.\n\nGiven the complexity and subjective nature of your experience, it might be beneficial to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to these episodes."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it appears you are experiencing a combination of sleep-related issues that could be linked to several factors.\n\n### Sleep Paralysis\n- Your descriptions of feeling paralyzed, unable to move or speak, and experiencing vivid hallucinations or dreams from which you cannot wake up are classic symptoms of sleep paralysis. This condition occurs during the transitions between waking and REM sleep, and it can be exacerbated by sleep deprivation, stress, anxiety, and certain sleep disorders like narcolepsy or insomnia[1][4][5].\n\n### Exploding Head Syndrome\n- The loud, explosion-like noises you hear as you fall asleep or wake up are characteristic of exploding head syndrome. This condition is also a parasomnia and can be triggered by stress, anxiety, and other neurological factors. It does not cause physical pain but can be startling and frightening[2][3][5\".\n\n### Underlying Factors\n- **Major Depression and Anxiety:** Both of these conditions can significantly impact your sleep patterns and increase the likelihood of experiencing sleep paralysis and exploding head syndrome[1][4][5].\n- **Sleep Schedule and Habits:** Although you mentioned that you sleep and wake up at the same times, frequent nighttime urination could disrupt your sleep quality. This disruption, combined with your occasional substance use and medication (Zyrtec), might contribute to your sleep issues[1][4].\n- **Short-Term Memory Loss:** While this could be related to various factors, including your mental health conditions, it is not directly linked to the sleep paralysis or exploding head syndrome. However, it is important to discuss this with your healthcare provider to rule out other underlying conditions.\n\n### Considerations and Next Steps\n- **Epilepsy:** While epilepsy can cause various neurological symptoms, the specific symptoms you described do not strongly suggest epilepsy. However, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying neurological conditions[2][3].\n- **Medical Evaluation:** Given the complexity of your symptoms, it would be beneficial to consult a sleep specialist or a healthcare provider who can evaluate your overall sleep habits, mental health, and any potential underlying medical conditions. They may recommend sleep studies or other diagnostic tests to better understand your situation[1][4][5].\n- **Management Strategies:** Improving sleep hygiene, reducing stress and anxiety through relaxation techniques or therapy, and addressing any underlying mental health conditions could help alleviate your symptoms. In some cases, medications that regulate REM sleep or reduce anxiety may also be prescribed[1][4][5].\n\n### Immediate Actions\n- **Keep a Sleep Diary:** Tracking your sleep patterns, including when you go to bed, wake up, and experience symptoms, can provide valuable information for your healthcare provider.\n- **Reduce Stress and Anxiety:** Engage in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or cognitive-behavioral therapy to help manage your anxiety and depression.\n- **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** Discuss your symptoms with a healthcare provider to get a comprehensive evaluation and guidance on managing your condition."

        "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your transition from Tegretol (carbamazepine) to Keppra (levetiracetam) and Topamax (topiramate), and considering the new medications primarily undergo renal clearance, here are some points to consider regarding blood testing:\n\n## Continuation of LFT and Addition of Renal Panel\n\n- **LFT (Liver Function Tests):** Although you are no longer on Tegretol, which is known for its hepatic metabolism and potential liver effects, it is still prudent to monitor liver function periodically, especially if you have a history of high LFT levels. However, the frequency might be reduced compared to when you were on Tegretol[2][5].\n\n## Addition of Renal Panel\n\n- **Renal Panel:** Since both Keppra and Topamax are primarily cleared by the kidneys, monitoring renal function becomes important. Your healthcare providers are likely to include a renal panel (which includes tests such as serum creatinine, urea, and electrolytes) to ensure that these medications are not adversely affecting your kidney function[2][5].\n\n## Therapeutic Drug Levels\n\n- **Therapeutic Drug Levels:** For newer AEDs like Keppra and Topamax, routine monitoring of therapeutic drug levels is not typically necessary unless there are specific clinical indications such as suspected non-compliance, breakthrough seizures, or changes in pharmacokinetics due to other factors (e.g., pregnancy, disease states, or drug interactions)[2][5].\n\n## Clinical Scenarios for Blood Testing\n\n- Blood tests, including LFT, CBC (or FBC), and possibly therapeutic drug levels, will likely be tailored based on clinical scenarios. For example:\n  - If you experience changes in seizure control or side effects, blood level monitoring might be useful to assess compliance or adjust dosages.\n  - During physiological changes (e.g., aging, pregnancy, or changes in health status), monitoring may be necessary to adjust dosages.\n  - In cases of polypharmacy or potential drug interactions, monitoring renal function and therapeutic levels could be crucial[1][2][5].\n\nIn summary, it is likely that your healthcare providers will continue some form of LFT monitoring, although less frequently than before, and will add a renal panel to monitor the effects of Keppra and Topamax on your kidney function. Therapeutic drug level monitoring may be reserved for specific clinical indications rather than being a routine practice."

Should I see my neurologist or GP about this It\u2019s been happening for about 2 months now, I think I have Blepharospasm in my left eye, could this be related to my epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing, such as your left eye sticking closed for a few seconds several times a day, could have several potential explanations, and it is important to distinguish between different possible causes.\n\n### Blepharospasm\nBlepharospasm, particularly benign essential blepharospasm (BEB), is characterized by involuntary contractions of the eyelid muscles, leading to twitching or forced closure of the eyelids. This condition is not typically associated with epilepsy but can be exacerbated by various factors such as dry eyes, certain medications, stress, and fatigue[1][3][5].\n\n### Relation to Epilepsy\nWhile blepharospasm itself is not a symptom of epilepsy, there are some considerations to keep in mind:\n- **Myoclonic Seizures**: If you suspect myoclonic seizures, these are a type of seizure that can cause brief, shock-like muscle contractions. However, myoclonic seizures typically involve more generalized muscle groups rather than isolated to one eye[2].\n- **Other Epileptic Manifestations**: Certain types of seizures or epileptic syndromes can involve focal motor symptoms, but isolated eyelid closure would be unusual as a standalone symptom of epilepsy.\n\n### Other Potential Causes\n- **Medication Side Effects**: Some of the medications you are taking, such as antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, abilify) and anticonvulsants (e.g., topamax), can cause muscle spasms or twitching as side effects[3][5].\n- **Secondary Blepharospasm**: This can be caused by other conditions such as dry eyes, ocular irritation, or as part of a syndrome like Meige syndrome or other systemic diseases[1][3].\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the duration and nature of your symptoms, it is prudent to consult with your neurologist for several reasons:\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: Your neurologist can help differentiate between blepharospasm, potential epilepsy-related symptoms, and other causes such as medication side effects.\n- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: A neurologist can perform a detailed clinical evaluation, including reviewing your medical history and current medications, to determine the most likely cause of your symptoms.\n- **Specific Treatment**: If diagnosed with blepharospasm, treatments such as botulinum toxin injections or other management strategies can be recommended. If it is related to your epilepsy or another condition, your neurologist can adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\nConsulting your neurologist will provide the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate management plan for your specific situation."

        "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When dealing with infantile spasms, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the best possible outcomes.\n\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nInfantile spasms are a medical emergency that requires prompt attention. Here are some key points:\n\n- The gold standard for diagnosing infantile spasms is an EEG, which can identify the characteristic hypsarrhythmia pattern[2][3][5].\n- Given your concerns, seeking an earlier EEG is a reasonable decision, as early treatment can significantly improve the child\u2019s long-term outlook[3][4][5].\n\n## Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder that can cause infantile spasms. Here are some points relevant to your questions:\n\n- TSC is caused by mutations in the _TSC1_ or _TSC2_ genes. These mutations are often de novo, meaning they occur spontaneously and are not inherited from the parents[3].\n- TSC may not be immediately diagnosable in infancy, as some signs may appear later in life[3][5].\n\n## Genetic Testing and 23andMe\n\n23andMe is a direct-to-consumer genetic testing service, but it is not designed for diagnosing medical conditions like tuberous sclerosis complex:\n\n- 23andMe reports are primarily for genetic health risks and carrier status for certain conditions, but they do not include comprehensive genetic testing for all possible mutations associated with TSC or other serious genetic disorders.\n- For a definitive diagnosis of TSC or other genetic mutations, clinical genetic testing through a healthcare provider is necessary. This typically involves targeted genetic sequencing of specific genes known to be associated with the condition[3].\n\nIn your situation, if there is a suspicion of tuberous sclerosis or another genetic cause for the infantile spasms, your child\u2019s healthcare provider will likely recommend specific genetic testing through a clinical laboratory, rather than relying on consumer genetic testing services like 23andMe."

My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start.

I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing are complex and involve multiple systems, but they do not strongly suggest catamenial epilepsy, which is a form of epilepsy triggered by the menstrual cycle. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Menstrual Migraine\nYour symptoms, such as the tight back, weird head sensations, and tingling in the arms and legs, could be related to menstrual migraines. These migraines are often triggered by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle and can include a variety of neurological symptoms, including aura-like phenomena and sensory disturbances[1][4].\n\n## Hormonal Headaches\nThe timing of your symptoms in relation to your menstrual cycle and the relief you get from ibuprofen suggest that hormonal changes might be a significant factor. Hormonal headaches, including menstrual migraines, can cause a range of symptoms including headache, nausea, and other systemic complaints[4].\n\n## Other Considerations\n- The episodes of tingling, heart feeling \"weird,\" and breathing difficulties could be part of a severe migraine or another condition exacerbated by hormonal changes.\n- The immediate relief from Ativan in previous episodes might indicate that your symptoms involve a significant anxiety or stress component, although Ativan is generally not a first-line treatment for migraines or other headache disorders[5].\n\n## Medical Evaluation\nGiven the severity and complexity of your symptoms, it is crucial to have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out other potential causes. Here are some steps you might consider:\n- **Neurological Evaluation**: Consult a neurologist to rule out other neurological conditions that might mimic these symptoms.\n- **Cardiovascular Evaluation**: Although your EKG was normal, further cardiovascular assessment might be necessary to ensure there are no underlying cardiac issues.\n- **Gynecological Evaluation**: Discuss your symptoms with your gynecologist to see if there are any hormonal or menstrual cycle-related treatments that could help.\n- **Psychological Evaluation**: Given the relief from Ativan, a psychological evaluation might help in managing any underlying anxiety or stress that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n## Treatment Adjustments\n- Continue to discuss your medication regimen with your doctor. For menstrual migraines, treatments such as NSAIDs, triptans, or hormonal therapies might be adjusted or combined to better manage your symptoms[1][4].\n- Consider preventive migraine medications or devices that can help mitigate these episodes[4].\n\nIn summary, while catamenial epilepsy is unlikely without a history of epilepsy or specific seizure-like activity, your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of hormonal, neurological, and possibly anxiety-related factors. A comprehensive medical evaluation is necessary to determine the best course of treatment."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms, it is prudent to consider several potential causes and take appropriate actions to ensure your health.\n\n### Possible Causes\n\n1. **Infections**:\n   - The swollen and painful occipital lymph node could be a sign of an infection, even though you do not have a fever. Local infections such as bacterial or fungal infections on the scalp, ear infections, or even the cystic acne on your cheek could be causing the lymph node swelling[2][3][4].\n   - Cat-scratch disease, scalp folliculitis, or cellulitis are also possible causes if you have been exposed to such conditions[1][2].\n\n2. **Autoimmune or Inflammatory Conditions**:\n   - Conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis, or other autoimmune disorders can cause lymph node swelling, especially if you have a history of such conditions[2][3][5].\n\n3. **Musculoskeletal Issues**:\n   - The muscular pain on the right side of your shoulder and neck could be related to the lifting and packing you did, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of the lymph node swelling. However, it might be contributing to your overall discomfort[2].\n\n4. **Migraine and Other Health Conditions**:\n   - Your recent migraine, which was particularly severe, could be related to various factors including stress, muscle strain, or even side effects from your medications. However, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the swollen lymph node[2].\n\n### Symptoms to Consider\n\n- **Pain and Swelling**: The tender and painful lump at the base of your skull is a significant symptom that requires attention.\n- **Headache**: Your severe migraine and ongoing headache, especially when lying down, suggest significant discomfort.\n- **Lethargy and General Malaise**: Feeling drained and lethargic could indicate an underlying infection or inflammation.\n- **Cystic Acne**: The painful acne on your cheek might be related to the lymph node swelling if it has become infected.\n\n### Steps to Take\n\n1. **Medical Consultation**:\n   - Given the severity of your symptoms and the possibility of an underlying infection or other serious conditions, it is essential to consult a healthcare provider. They can perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and possibly order blood tests or radiographic imaging to determine the cause of the swollen lymph node[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Address the Acne**:\n   - Ensure that the cystic acne on your cheek is properly treated. If it is infected, antibiotics or topical treatments may be necessary.\n\n3. **Manage Pain**:\n   - Over-the-counter pain relievers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with the swollen lymph node and headache.\n\n4. **Monitor Symptoms**:\n   - Keep an eye on whether the swelling persists, increases, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss. These could indicate a more serious underlying condition[2][3][5].\n\nGiven your medical history, including epilepsy, migraines, and endometriosis, and the recent changes in your medication regimen (starting Aptiom two weeks ago), it is also worth discussing these factors with your healthcare provider to rule out any potential side effects or interactions that could be contributing to your symptoms."

        "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The presentation described for your sister-in-law is complex and involves several factors that need to be considered:\n\n## Epilepsy and Seizure Types\n- She has been diagnosed with epilepsy, which can manifest in various forms, including focal seizures (such as temporal lobe seizures) and generalized seizures (like tonic-clonic seizures)[1][5].\n\n## Postictal Phase\n- After a seizure, individuals often enter a postictal phase, characterized by confusion, disorientation, and sometimes abnormal behavior. This phase can last from minutes to hours and is a normal part of the seizure recovery process[1][5%.\n\n## Psychiatric and Behavioral Changes\n- The behavior of speaking in the third person, using a different voice, and displaying child-like behavior could be part of a postictal confusion or a rare but possible manifestation of a seizure disorder. Some people experience complex behaviors during or after seizures, which can include automatism (repetitive, unconscious behaviors) or other altered mental states[1][3].\n\n## Potential Impact of Medications\n- The neurologist suggested that her depression medications might be an uncommon cause of her epilepsy. It's also important to consider any interactions between her depression medications, sleeping tablets, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), as these can sometimes contribute to unusual side effects or exacerbate seizure activity[1][4].\n\n## Eating Disorder and Nutritional Deficiencies\n- Malnourishment due to eating disorders can trigger seizures or exacerbate existing seizure disorders. Deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, and blood sugar imbalances can all contribute to seizure activity[2].\n\n## Immediate Medical Evaluation\n- Given the severity and frequency of her seizures, along with the unusual postictal behaviors, it is crucial that she is being evaluated comprehensively by a neurologist. The CT scan and blood tests will help identify any structural brain anomalies, infections, or metabolic imbalances that might be contributing to her seizures and postictal behaviors.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- **Status Epilepticus**: Having multiple seizures in a short period, especially if they are severe and follow one another without full recovery in between, can indicate status epilepticus, a medical emergency that requires immediate attention[1][5].\n- **Psychiatric and Neurological Overlap**: The combination of epilepsy, depression, and an eating disorder complicates the clinical picture. It is essential to address each of these conditions holistically to ensure her overall health and safety.\n\nIn summary, while the postictal behaviors are concerning, they could be part of her seizure disorder. However, the comprehensive evaluation by the neurologist, including imaging and blood tests, will provide more clarity on the underlying causes and necessary adjustments to her treatment plan."

        "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can\u2019t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can\u2019t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it\u2019s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can\u2019t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",

        "answer": "Given your partner's symptoms and the extensive medical evaluations he has undergone, there are several potential causes and considerations that need to be explored further:\n\n## Sensory Overload and Hyperesthesia\nYour partner's intolerance to various stimuli, such as light, physical activity, and certain sensory inputs, suggests conditions like sensory overload or hyperesthesia. These conditions can result from a variety of factors, including peripheral nerve disorders, brain injuries, or other neurological issues[3][5].\n\n## Anisocoria and Neurological Implications\nThe occurrence of anisocoria (uneven pupil sizes) at two separate moments is a significant finding. Anisocoria can be associated with serious underlying conditions such as:\n- Brain injuries or tumors\n- Strokes or subarachnoid hemorrhage\n- Meningitis (although neurologists have ruled this out, it is still important to keep in mind)\n- Third nerve palsy (oculomotor nerve dysfunction)\n- Other intracranial conditions[2][4].\n\n## Migraines and Other Headaches\nThe severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, and intolerance to light and sound are symptoms that can be associated with migraines. Migraines can sometimes cause anisocoria and other sensory sensitivities[4].\n\n## Neurological and Systemic Conditions\nGiven the range of symptoms, it's crucial to consider systemic and neurological conditions that could explain these findings:\n- **Multiple Sclerosis**: Brainstem damage can lead to sensory hypersensitivity and other neurological symptoms.\n- **Wilson's Disease**: The low ceruloplasmin levels and the neurological symptoms suggest this should be further investigated, despite the difficulties in obtaining the lab tests.\n- **Porphyria**: This group of disorders can cause a variety of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, including severe headaches and sensitivity to light.\n- **Other Neurological Conditions**: Conditions like post-traumatic migraine, epilepsy, or other neurodegenerative disorders could also be contributing factors[3][4].\n\n## Laboratory Tests and Further Evaluation\nDespite the challenges, it is critical to complete the blood and urine tests for Wilson's disease and porphyria. Additionally, considering the symptoms of headache, nausea, and balance issues, further neuroimaging or specialist consultations (e.g., a neuro-otologist for balance issues) might be necessary.\n\n## Immediate Care\nGiven the severity of his symptoms and the potential for serious underlying conditions, it may be prudent to seek emergency medical attention if his condition worsens or if he experiences sudden changes such as increased confusion, severe headache, or other acute neurological symptoms.\n\n## Medication and Treatment\nSince he has stopped most of his medications and is only on nitroglycerine dermal patches, it is important to consult with his healthcare providers to ensure that no critical medications are being wrongly discontinued. Also, managing his symptoms with appropriate pain relief and anti-nausea medications under medical supervision could be beneficial.\n\n## Holistic Approach\nA multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, internal medicine, and possibly other specialties such as ophthalmology or otology may be necessary to fully understand and manage his condition."

        "question": "I 18M have frontal lobe epilepsy and started smoking weed before I was diagnosed but now it's getting a bit boring and im often offered molly and coke and was wondering if it was safe for me to take since I'm fine with weed and booze",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "For someone with frontal lobe epilepsy, using substances like MDMA (molly) and cocaine is not safe and can be particularly risky. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Marijuana\nWhile some studies suggest that marijuana, particularly its constituent cannabidiol, may have antiepileptic effects in certain cases, its impact on epilepsy is still not fully understood. However, it is generally considered that marijuana use does not significantly affect seizure frequency in most people with epilepsy[2][4].\n\n## Other Illicit Drugs\nIn contrast, frequent use of other illicit drugs such as MDMA and cocaine can significantly increase the risk of seizures. These substances can lower the seizure threshold, making it more likely for seizures to occur. Studies have shown that frequent use of non-cannabis illicit drugs, including amphetamines and cocaine, can worsen seizure control in people with epilepsy[4].\n\n## Alcohol\nWhile moderate alcohol consumption (one to two drinks per day) is generally not associated with an increased risk of seizures, alcohol withdrawal can lower the seizure threshold, and chronic alcohol abuse is linked to an increased risk of seizures[2].\n\n## Specific Risks\n- **MDMA and Cocaine**: These drugs can lead to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, all of which can exacerbate the risk of seizures. Additionally, these substances can disrupt normal brain activity and potentially trigger seizures.\n- **Interactions with Medications**: If you are on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), using illicit substances can complicate your treatment. These substances can interact with your medications or affect their efficacy, leading to poor seizure control or increased side effects[1][3].\n\nGiven these considerations, it is strongly advised to avoid using MDMA and cocaine if you have frontal lobe epilepsy. Consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice on managing your condition and any interactions with substances you may be using. They can help you make informed decisions to ensure your safety and optimal management of your epilepsy."

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

        "answer": "Dealing with a loved one experiencing Super-Refractory Status Epilepticus (SRSE) is incredibly challenging, and the lack of definitive treatments and unclear outcomes can be particularly daunting. Here are some key points and considerations based on the current medical literature:\n\n## Current Treatment Approaches\n- **Anesthetic Agents**: Propofol, midazolam, and pentobarbital are commonly used as first-line treatments for SRSE. Your fianc\u00e9e has already been treated with propofol, midazolam, and phenobarbital, with some temporary success but eventual failure to stop the seizures[3][5].\n- **Other Medications**: Ketamine and depakote have been tried, which is in line with current practices, but they also failed to provide sustained relief in her case[3].\n- **Barbiturate Coma**: The plan to induce a barbiturate coma using pentobarbital is a serious step, often considered when other treatments fail. This approach can be effective in stopping seizures but comes with significant risks and potential complications, including respiratory depression, hypotension, and increased risk of infections[5].\n\n## Experimental and Alternative Therapies\n- **Therapeutic Hypothermia**: Although there is limited evidence supporting its effectiveness for SRSE, therapeutic hypothermia has been proposed and studied. However, the HYBERNATUS study found no significant difference in outcomes between patients treated with hypothermia and those receiving standard treatment[1].\n- **Ketogenic Diet (KD)**: While there is some anecdotal evidence suggesting that KD might be beneficial, the evidence is insufficient, and the number of studies is very limited. It may not be feasible to initiate KD in an intensive care setting, especially given her current unstable condition[1][3].\n- **Allopregnanolone**: You mentioned a study involving allopregnanolone, which, although promising with only two cases, suggests potential benefits. However, this is still highly experimental and not widely established as a treatment for SRSE[Your input].\n\n## Prognosis and Outcomes\n- **Mortality and Disability**: SRSE has a high mortality rate (around 24.1%) and a significant risk of severe disability for survivors. The longer the duration of SRSE, the higher the risk of moderate to severe disability[3].\n- **Recovery of Mental Functioning**: The likelihood of retaining mental functioning after prolonged SRSE is uncertain and varies widely among patients. Factors such as younger age and fewer antiseizure medications tried may be associated with better outcomes, but these are not guarantees[3].\n\n## Support and Coping\n- **Medical Team Collaboration**: It is crucial to maintain open and detailed communication with her medical team. They are likely doing everything possible within the current medical understanding and guidelines.\n- **Emotional Support**: Seeking support from family, friends, or professional counselors can help you cope with the emotional strain of this situation.\n- **Follow-Up and Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and follow-up are essential. The medical team should be vigilant about potential complications and adjust treatments accordingly.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Autoimmune Disorder Labs**: Waiting for the results of autoimmune disorder labs could provide more insights into the underlying cause of her condition.\n- **Infection Rule-Out**: Given her symptoms before the seizures (nausea, vomiting, elevated temperature), ensuring that all possible infections have been ruled out is important, even though the initial tests were negative.\n- **Neurological Causes**: The positive Babinski reflex before the seizures, although asymptomatic, might suggest an underlying neurologic issue that was not fully investigated. However, this is speculative at this point.\n\nGiven the complexity and severity of SRSE, it is important to understand that the medical community is still in the process of developing effective treatments, and each case can have highly variable outcomes. Your support and advocacy for her care, combined with the best efforts of her medical team, are crucial during this challenging time."

        "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "To better understand the terms related to your diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy, here\u2019s a breakdown of the key concepts:\n\n## Ex-Vacuo Dilatation of the Ventricular Trigone\n- \"Ex-vacuo\" refers to a condition where there is an enlargement or expansion of a space due to the loss of surrounding tissue. In this context, the ventricular trigone, which is a part of the brain's ventricular system, has expanded due to the atrophy (shrinkage) of adjacent brain tissue. This suggests that there has been some loss of brain volume in the surrounding areas, likely due to the conditions mentioned in your diagnosis, such as seizure-related brain injury or previous ischemic inflammatory insults[1][3].\n\n## T-Weighted High-Signal Gliosis\n- In MRI imaging, \"T-weighted high-signal\" refers to areas that appear brighter on T-weighted images. Gliosis is a nonspecific reactive change of glial cells in response to damage to the central nervous system (CNS). In your case, the T-weighted high-signal gliosis in the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe indicates an area of reactive glial cell proliferation, which is a response to injury or damage. This could be a result of the seizure activity, previous ischemic events, or inflammatory processes[1][3].\n\n## Abnormalities Involving the Right Hippocampus\n- The hippocampus is a crucial part of the temporal lobe involved in memory and emotional processes. Abnormalities here, such as those seen in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), can lead to focal impaired awareness seizures. MTS is characterized by scarring and cell loss in the hippocampus, which can disrupt normal brain function and contribute to seizure activity[1][3].\n\n## Associated Regional Atrophy\n- Atrophy refers to the shrinkage of brain tissue, which can result from various causes including injury, disease, or aging. In your diagnosis, there is regional atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus, which means that part of the thalamus has shrunk. This atrophy can be a consequence of the underlying conditions causing your seizures and may contribute to the overall seizure activity and other neurological symptoms[1][3.).\n\n## Periventricular White Matter\n- The periventricular white matter is the area of brain tissue surrounding the ventricles, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain. This area is part of the normal brain structure but can be affected by various pathological processes. In your case, the T-weighted high-signal gliosis in this area suggests damage or reactive changes, which are likely part of the overall brain injury or disease process[1][3].\n\n## Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS)\n- MTS is a specific condition where there is scarring and cell loss in the mesial (inner) part of the temporal lobe, particularly affecting the hippocampus. This is a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy and can result from various insults such as seizures, infections, or ischemic events. It is often associated with focal impaired awareness seizures and may also involve other parts of the temporal lobe[1][3].\n\nUnderstanding these terms should help you grasp the extent and nature of your brain's structural changes and how they relate to your temporal lobe epilepsy. It is important to continue discussing these details with your neurologist to ensure you receive the best possible care and management for your condition."

        "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your complex and varied symptoms, it is crucial to continue pursuing a comprehensive diagnosis, especially since your initial blood test for myasthenia gravis was negative but your symptoms persist and have expanded.\n\n### Myasthenia Gravis Considerations\n- Despite the negative antibody test, myasthenia gravis (MG) cannot be ruled out entirely, especially if you have symptoms like muscle weakness, double vision, drooping eyelids (ptosis), and difficulty with eye movements. Some people with MG do not have detectable antibodies, a condition known as seronegative myasthenia gravis[1][5|.\n- Your symptoms such as muscle weakness in the eyes, difficulty opening your eyes, and general muscle fatigue are consistent with MG.\n- Additional tests like repetitive nerve stimulation, single-fiber electromyography (EMG), and the ice pack test might be necessary to confirm the diagnosis[1][3][5].\n\n### Other Symptoms and Conditions\n- **Seizures and Epilepsy**: While your neurologist considers the seizures unrelated to your current symptoms, it is essential to monitor and manage your epilepsy given your medication regimen.\n- **Vertigo and Oscillopsia**: These symptoms, along with nystagmus, suggest a vestibular or neuro-ophthalmological issue. The normal MRI of your vestibular system does not rule out other neurological causes.\n- **Tremors and Flushing**: These could be indicative of various neurologic or systemic conditions and need further evaluation.\n- **Complex Migraines**: While managed with triptans, these could be part of a broader neurological picture.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Neuro-ophthalmologist Referral**: This is a good step, as they can provide specialized evaluation for your eye symptoms and their potential relationship to MG or other neurologic conditions.\n- **Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation**: Given the breadth of your symptoms, a thorough neurological examination, including further electrodiagnostic tests (like EMG or nerve conduction studies), might be necessary.\n- **Systemic Evaluation**: Considering your flushing, tremors, and other systemic symptoms, an evaluation by a specialist in neurology or a multi-disciplinary team may help identify underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n### Medication Review\n- Ensure that your current medications are not contributing to your symptoms. Sometimes, medications can cause side effects that mimic neurological conditions.\n\nGiven the complexity and severity of your symptoms, it is important to persist in seeking a definitive diagnosis and to consider the possibility that you may have more than one underlying condition contributing to your symptoms."

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your theory has some merit, but it is important to consider several factors and complexities associated with Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) and the interplay with other conditions.\n\n### Coexistence of Epilepsy and PNES\nIt is indeed possible for individuals to have both epilepsy and PNES, as you mentioned. About 10% of patients with PNES also have epilepsy[2][5].\n\n### Role of Keppra\nKeppra (levetiracetam) is an antiseizure medication. If your wife had underlying epilepsy, Keppra could have been effective in controlling the epileptic seizures and associated symptoms, including hallucinations. However, once she stopped taking Keppra, the epileptic seizures and their symptoms could have returned.\n\n### PNES and Hallucinations\nPNES themselves are not typically associated with hallucinations. Hallucinations are more commonly linked to other psychiatric or neurological conditions, such as psychosis or epilepsy. The return of hallucinations after stopping Keppra suggests that these hallucinations might be related to an underlying condition that was being managed by the medication[2][5].\n\n### Psychological and Psychiatric Factors\nPNES are deeply rooted in psychological and emotional distress. The hallucinations, suicidal tendencies, and self-harm behaviors your wife experienced could be part of a broader psychiatric picture that needs to be addressed. The fact that these symptoms resurfaced after stopping Keppra highlights the need for a comprehensive treatment plan that includes both psychiatric and psychological interventions[1][4][5].\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the complexity of your wife's condition, here are some steps you might consider:\n\n- **Re-evaluate the Diagnosis**: Ensure that the diagnosis of PNES is accurate and that there is no underlying epilepsy that needs to be managed. The EEG results were indicative of PNES, but the return of hallucinations suggests a need to reassess the presence of epilepsy or other conditions.\n  \n- **Psychiatric and Psychological Treatment**: Continue or intensify psychiatric and psychological treatments to address the underlying emotional and psychological issues contributing to PNES. This could include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), intensive outpatient programs, or other therapies such as dialectical behavioral therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)[1][4].\n\n- **Medication Adjustments**: If the return of hallucinations is due to an underlying condition like epilepsy, it may be necessary to reinstate or adjust antiseizure medications under the guidance of a neurologist. However, this should be done carefully, as continuing antiseizure medications in patients with PNES can be associated with poor outcomes if epilepsy is not present[1].\n\n- **Collaborative Care**: Ensure that your wife's care is managed collaboratively between a neurologist, psychiatrist, and other mental health professionals to address both the neurological and psychiatric aspects of her condition.\n\nIn summary, your theory about the Keppra controlling underlying epilepsy symptoms is plausible, but it is crucial to address the broader psychiatric and psychological context to manage both PNES and any coexisting conditions effectively."

        "question": " Hi, I bit of back story here I've been diagnostic with NF1 when I was 5 ever since I had to do 2 MRI every year. every time they put a needle in my arm I would faint.So today I just got my blood draw for a schedule MRI in 3 weeks. And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you experienced, particularly the uncontrollable movement of your arms and legs after fainting during a blood draw, could be related to several factors, some of which may be associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) or other conditions. Here are some possibilities:\n\n## Vasovagal Syncope\nThis is a common cause of fainting, especially in response to medical procedures like blood draws. It can also lead to brief, involuntary movements due to the temporary lack of blood flow to the brain[5].\n\n## Seizure-Like Activity\nAlthough rare, some individuals with NF1 may experience seizure-like activities, particularly if there are any underlying neurological conditions. However, this would typically require further investigation and is not commonly directly linked to blood draws or fainting.\n\n## Anxiety and Stress Response\nHigh levels of anxiety or stress during medical procedures can exacerbate physical reactions, including involuntary movements. This is more of a psychological and physiological response rather than a direct neurological complication of NF1.\n\n## Neurological Complications of NF1\nWhile NF1 itself is not typically associated with seizure-like movements directly triggered by medical procedures, the condition can involve various neurological complications. For example, some patients with NF1 may have increased susceptibility to certain types of seizures or other neurological issues, although these are not usually triggered by routine blood draws.\n\n## Vascular Complications\nNF1 can involve vascular complications such as hypertension, stenosis, or other vascular abnormalities, which might contribute to unusual reactions during stress or medical procedures. However, these would not typically cause uncontrollable movements of the limbs[1][3].\n\nGiven your history of fainting during blood draws, it is likely that the most immediate cause is a vasovagal syncope. However, to ensure there are no underlying neurological or vascular issues, it would be wise to discuss this incident with your healthcare provider. They can perform a thorough evaluation, including possibly an EEG or other neurological tests, to rule out any other potential causes.\n\nIt is also important to inform your healthcare team about this specific incident so they can take necessary precautions during future medical procedures to prevent similar reactions."

        "question": "49YO female with IBS like symptoms due to adhesions choking intestines, non-epileptic seizures due to migraines, deaf, in TCHP chemo for breast cancer, BMX August 1, 2018, no node involvement. 5'6, 220lbs. Effexor for seizure prevention. Bupropion for situational depression related to health challenges. I lost my hair to chemo, so for the first time I noticed I have ridges in my scalp. Googling that, only one thing comes up: Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG). My ridges, however, are very mild compared to most images. I can see them in the mirror, but can't find a way to accurately photograph them. They are very much like this in location and \"layout\", but not quite as deep. This is listed as something different though, related to mental retardation (article's words) from birth. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00105-007-1302-4 I do have a couple of the secondary issues listed, namely non-epileptic seizures and deafness. The former is blamed on migraines that left lesions on the brain and the latter is blamed on the seizures. Should I see an endocrinologist, or is this something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, it is important to approach the diagnosis and management of the scalp ridges you are experiencing with a thorough and multi-disciplinary approach. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Nature of Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG)\nCVG is characterized by thickened, furrowed skin on the scalp, resulting in a wrinkled or ridged appearance. It can be classified into primary and secondary forms:\n- **Primary CVG**: This can be further divided into essential (no associated systemic conditions) and non-essential (associated with neuropsychiatric disorders or ophthalmological abnormalities)[1][3][5].\n- **Secondary CVG**: This is associated with underlying systemic conditions such as acromegaly, pachydermoperiostosis, or other neoplastic syndromes[1][3][5].\n\n## Your Specific Situation\n- You have mild ridges on your scalp that became noticeable after chemotherapy-induced hair loss.\n- You have a history of non-epileptic seizures due to migraines and deafness, which could suggest some underlying neurological issues.\n- Your current medications include Effexor for seizure prevention and Bupropion for situational depression.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Dermatological Evaluation\nGiven the visual appearance of your scalp, a dermatological examination is essential. A dermatologist can assess the scalp changes and differentiate CVG from other dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, or lip edematous scalp. They may also perform a skin biopsy or imaging studies to rule out other conditions[1][3][5].\n\n### Endocrinological Evaluation\nSince secondary CVG can be associated with systemic conditions like acromegaly (which involves hormonal imbalances), it might be prudent to consult an endocrinologist. This is particularly relevant if there are any suspicions of hormonal imbalances or other endocrine-related disorders that could be contributing to your scalp condition[1][3][5].\n\n### Consideration of Underlying Conditions\nYour history of non-epileptic seizures and deafness, while attributed to migraines and subsequent brain lesions, should be taken into account. It is possible that these conditions could be linked to a form of primary non-essential CVG, which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders[1][3].\n\n### Comprehensive Medical History\nEnsure that your healthcare provider has a complete picture of your medical history, including your current medications and the treatments you have undergone. This will help in making an accurate diagnosis and developing an appropriate management plan.\n\nIn summary, while your symptoms may not align exactly with the more severe forms of CVG, it is crucial to consult both a dermatologist and potentially an endocrinologist to rule out any underlying systemic conditions and to manage your scalp changes effectively."

        "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your concerns about increasing the dosage of Keppra for your son are understandable, but there are several reasons why the neurologist might recommend this adjustment, even if the current dosage seems to be working.\n\n## Gradual Dose Increase\nIt is common practice to start patients on a lower dose of Keppra and gradually increase it every 2 weeks to achieve the optimal therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects. This approach helps the body adjust to the medication and reduces the risk of adverse reactions[1][3][5].\n\n## Achieving Therapeutic Levels\nThe initial dose of 2ml (which is typically 100 mg/mL, so 2ml would be 200 mg) might not be sufficient to completely control the seizures in the long term. Increasing the dose to 3ml (300 mg) could help in achieving the therapeutic levels necessary to prevent future seizures more effectively.\n\n## Standard Dosage Ranges\nFor children, especially those with idiopathic epilepsy, the recommended dosages of Keppra are often based on body weight. For example, for children aged 6 to less than 16 years, the starting dose is typically around 10 mg/kg twice daily, with the recommended maintenance dose being around 30 mg/kg twice daily[1][3][5].\n\n## Monitoring and Adjustment\nThe neurologist is likely monitoring your son's response to the medication and adjusting the dose accordingly. Even if the current dose seems effective, the neurologist may be aiming to reach a dose that is more likely to provide long-term seizure control with minimal side effects.\n\n## Prevention of Seizure Recurrence\nIncreasing the dose now, even though your son has had no major episodes recently, can help prevent future seizures. Seizure control is often a balance between achieving sufficient medication levels to prevent seizures and minimizing side effects.\n\n## Consultation with the Neurologist\nIt is important to discuss your concerns with the neurologist. They can provide specific reasons for the dose increase based on your son's individual response to the medication, the type of seizures he is experiencing, and any other relevant medical factors. The neurologist can also address any concerns about potential side effects and how they will be monitored and managed[1][3][5].\n\nIn summary, the dose increase is likely a part of the standard protocol to ensure optimal seizure control while minimizing the risk of side effects. Open communication with the neurologist will help you understand the rationale behind the dosage adjustment and alleviate any concerns you may have."

Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The swelling you are experiencing above your left clavicle, which is likely in the area of your lymph nodes, can indeed be attributed to the recent tetanus vaccination. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Lymph Node Swelling After Vaccination\nLymph node swelling is a common and normal reaction to vaccinations, including the tetanus shot. This swelling is usually a sign of the immune system responding to the vaccine, as the lymph nodes produce white blood cells to fight off the perceived infection[1][4].\n\n## Timing\nThe swelling typically occurs 2-4 days after the vaccination, which aligns with your timeline since you received the tetanus shot five days ago[4].\n\n## Location\nThe swelling is often in the lymph nodes near the site of the injection, which in your case would be the left arm and possibly the surrounding areas, including above the clavicle[1][4].\n\n## Reassurance\nWhile it is always good to consult with your doctor to rule out any other potential causes, the likelihood that the swelling is due to the vaccination is high. Such swelling usually resolves on its own within a few weeks[1][4].\n\nGiven your medical history, including Graves' disease and recent medication changes, it is prudent to inform your doctor about these factors during your appointment. However, in this context, the recent vaccination is the most likely cause of the lymph node swelling."

        "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "If you missed a dose of your anti-epilepsy medications, including Vimpat (levetiracetam) and Phenobarbital, there are several points to consider:\n\n## Risk of Breakthrough Seizures\nMissing a dose of your anti-epilepsy medications can increase the risk of breakthrough seizures. This is because the medications help control electrical activity in the brain, and a missed dose can lead to uncontrolled activity, potentially triggering a seizure[1][2][3'.\n\n## What to Do When You Miss a Dose\n- If you miss a dose, it is generally recommended to take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next scheduled dose. You should not double up on your doses[2][5].\n\n## Specific Medications\n- **Vimpat (levetiracetam):** Since Vimpat has a relatively short half-life compared to other medications, missing a dose for an extended period (in your case, 3 hours) could reduce its therapeutic effect. However, the specific guidance for handling missed doses of Vimpat suggests taking the missed dose as soon as possible unless it is near the time for the next dose[5|.\n- **Phenobarbital:** Phenobarbital has a longer half-life (53\u2013118 hours) but still requires consistent dosing to maintain therapeutic levels. For Phenobarbital, if the dose is delayed within a short period (e.g., 1-2 hours), you should take the missed dose immediately and then resume your regular schedule[5].\n\n## Immediate Actions\n- You have already taken the missed dose, which is the correct initial step.\n- Monitor your condition closely for any signs of a breakthrough seizure.\n\n## Risks and Precautions\n- Since you have important tasks this week, including driving, it is prudent to be cautious. If you experience any unusual symptoms or feel that your seizure control might be compromised, consider postponing tasks that require your full attention and safety, such as driving[2][3].\n\n## When You Are in the Clear\n- The risk period for breakthrough seizures varies, but generally, if you have taken the missed dose and resumed your regular schedule, you should be back within the therapeutic range of your medications soon.\n- For Vimpat, since it is mostly cleared from the body within 12 hours, you would likely be back in the therapeutic range within a few hours after taking the missed dose.\n- For Phenobarbital, with its longer half-life, the impact of a missed dose is generally less immediate, but consistency is still crucial.\n\n## Communication with Your Doctor\n- It is good that you have contacted your doctor. Wait for their specific advice, as they can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history and current treatment plan.\n\nIn summary, while there is an increased risk of breakthrough seizures after missing a dose, taking the missed dose as soon as possible and resuming your regular schedule can help mitigate this risk. However, it is always best to follow the specific advice of your healthcare provider, especially given your upcoming activities."

        "question": "28F. 5'8, 250lbs. White. History of epilepsy, asthma and vitamin D & B12 deficiency. Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the high Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level of 122.2 mIU/mL, along with the absence of menstruation for six months, it is likely that you are experiencing premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).\n\n### Spontaneous Recovery\nWhile it is not common, there is a possibility of intermittent ovarian function even after a diagnosis of POI. Studies suggest that about 50% of women with POI may experience some intermittent ovarian function, and approximately 5-10% may even become pregnant after the diagnosis[4].\n\nHowever, the likelihood of spontaneous recovery and return to normal menstrual cycles is relatively low, and it is generally not expected.\n\n### Causes of Premature Menopause\nSeveral factors could be contributing to your condition:\n\n- **Genetic Disorders**: Chromosomal abnormalities, such as Turner syndrome, or other genetic conditions can lead to premature menopause[3][5].\n- **Autoimmune Diseases**: Conditions like thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders can cause the body's immune system to attack the ovaries, leading to premature menopause[3][5].\n- **Medical Treatments**: Although you did not mention any recent chemotherapy or radiation, these treatments are known to cause premature menopause. However, certain medications and surgical procedures can also impact ovarian function[2][5].\n- **Smoking and Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking is associated with an earlier onset of menopause, though you did not mention smoking in your history[3][5].\n- **Family History**: A family history of early or premature menopause can increase the risk[2][5].\n- **Other Health Conditions**: Certain health conditions, such as HIV and AIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome, and metabolic disorders, can also contribute to premature menopause[5].\n\n### Health Concerns\nPremature menopause can have significant health implications due to the early loss of estrogen:\n\n- **Osteoporosis**: Lower estrogen levels increase the risk of bone density loss and osteoporosis[2][4][5].\n- **Cardiovascular Disease**: Early menopause is associated with a higher risk of heart disease due to the lack of protective effects of estrogen[2][4][5].\n- **Mental Health**: Emotional changes, depression, and anxiety are common, especially given the sudden loss of fertility and body changes[2][4][5].\n- **Other Health Risks**: Increased risk for colon and ovarian cancer, periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cataract formation have also been noted[4].\n\n### Management and Treatment\nTo manage your symptoms and reduce the risk of associated health conditions:\n\n- **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)**: This can help replace the missing hormones and mitigate symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes. However, it should be discussed with your healthcare provider, especially considering your epilepsy and other medications[1][2][4].\n- **Lifestyle Changes**: Regular exercise, a balanced diet rich in calcium, and other lifestyle modifications can help manage symptoms and maintain overall health[1].\n- **Emotional Support**: Counselling or support groups can be beneficial in coping with the emotional impact of premature menopause[2][5].\n\nGiven your complex medical history, including epilepsy and current medications, it is crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment and management for your specific situation."

After some months I was diagnosed with epilepsy.In the beginning I was having 1-3 seizures a day while 2-4 of those were grand mal seizures a month. Medications didn\u2019t work and just seemed to make everything worse so my neurologist made the decision to not give me medications after having tried 5 of them.It\u2019s been a few years now and nowadays I get anywhere from 2-5? Every 4months and about 2 or 3 of those are grand mal seizures. A significant decrease but still ongoing. We never found a cause for the seizures.Well I\u2019m asking because a few months back I started noticing a few things that started worrying me. For example,    a few years back and at the beginning of this I used to be \u201csmart\u201d as in I could write any word no matter how big or small but in recent months I\u2019ve noticed I have a really hard time writing, as in spelling out words.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing are commonly associated with the cognitive and neuropsychological impacts of epilepsy, particularly when seizures are not well-controlled or when they affect specific areas of the brain.\n\n## Memory and Cognitive Impairments\nEpilepsy can significantly affect memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. Here are some key points that align with your experiences:\n\n- **Memory Impairment**: People with epilepsy often experience difficulties with short-term and long-term memory. This can manifest as forgetting simple words, tasks, or even recent events[1][3][5].\n- **Language Problems**: Difficulty recalling words, using simple words incorrectly, or mistaking one word for another can be due to the impact of seizures on language-processing areas of the brain, such as the temporal lobe[1][3].\n- **Speech Impediments**: Stuttering or getting \"stuck\" while trying to say a word can be a result of the disruption in brain activity associated with seizures, especially if they affect areas responsible for speech and language[1][3].\n\n## Writing and Spelling Difficulties\nThe challenges you face with writing and spelling, such as relying heavily on autocorrect or forgetting how to spell simple words, can be linked to several factors:\n- **Visual-Spatial Skills and Language Processing**: Epilepsy can affect the brain's ability to process and retain visual information, which is crucial for writing and spelling[1][3].\n- **High-Frequency Oscillations (HFOs)**: Even in well-controlled epilepsy, transient bursts of high-frequency electrical activity (HFOs) can interfere with normal brain function, leading to cognitive deficits, including problems with writing and language[5].\n\n## Frequency and Type of Seizures\nGiven your history of frequent seizures, including grand mal seizures, it is likely that these events are contributing to your cognitive and memory issues. Here are a few considerations:\n- **Cluster Seizures**: These can cause significant cognitive impairment due to the prolonged and repeated disruption of brain activity. The fact that you have experienced cluster seizures, including ones where you stopped breathing, suggests a high level of neurological impact[1][3][4].\n- **Impact on Brain Structures**: Repeated seizures, especially those affecting the temporal lobe (common in many types of epilepsy), can lead to hippocampal atrophy and other structural changes that impair memory and cognitive functions[3].\n\n## Management and Treatment\nWhile medications did not work in your case, there are other approaches that might be helpful:\n- **Cognitive Rehabilitation**: Programs focused on improving thinking and memory skills can be beneficial. These programs are designed to help you compensate for cognitive deficits and improve overall function[1].\n- **Addressing Comorbid Conditions**: Anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues can exacerbate cognitive problems. Addressing these conditions through therapy or medication can help improve your overall cognitive state[1].\n- **Advanced Diagnostic and Treatment Options**: Consultation with a comprehensive epilepsy center could provide additional insights and treatment options, such as advanced brain wave tests, video monitoring during seizures, or even surgical interventions if appropriate[2][4].\n\nGiven the complex nature of your symptoms and the history of your seizures, it would be beneficial to consult with a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy to explore all available treatment options and address your specific cognitive and memory concerns."

I'm curious if there should be any hidden Long-term Health effects caused by my consumption of that much keppra that may not be obvious such as kidney, liver, or brain problems. Additionally, I am curious how likely it is I would have died from consuming that much Keppra and if a death from keppra would be painful.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Consuming a large dose of levetiracetam (Keppra), as in your case, can have several potential health implications, both immediate and long-term.\n\n### Immediate Effects\n- In overdose, levetiracetam can cause significant sedation and respiratory depression. Your symptoms of vomiting, falling asleep, and then waking up feeling relatively normal are consistent with the sedating effects of the drug. However, the need for medical intervention, such as intubation, can arise due to severe respiratory depression, as seen in other case reports[1][5].\n\n### Long-term Health Effects\n\n#### Kidney Problems\n- There have been reports of acute kidney injury following levetiracetam overdose. This condition can be severe enough to require dialysis, as observed in a case where a patient developed oliguria and elevated creatinine levels after ingesting a large dose of levetiracetam[5]. Although your immediate symptoms did not include signs of renal failure, it is crucial to monitor your kidney function over time.\n\n#### Liver Problems\n- While rare, levetiracetam has been associated with acute liver failure in some cases. These instances are not common but highlight the potential for hepatocyte damage and liver injury. Discontinuation of the drug usually leads to improvement in liver function, but it is an important consideration for long-term health monitoring[2][3].\n\n#### Brain and Neurological Problems\n- Behavioral and psychological disturbances are common side effects of levetiracetam, even at therapeutic doses. These can include agitation, anxiety, irritability, and other mood changes. In cases of overdose, these effects can be more pronounced. Long-term neurological effects are less commonly reported but could include persistent mood changes or other neuropsychiatric issues[3][4].\n\n### Mortality Risk and Pain\n- While overdose of levetiracetam can be serious, mortality is relatively rare if appropriate medical care is provided. The primary risks include respiratory depression and potential organ failure (such as kidney or liver failure). If left untreated, severe respiratory depression could lead to fatal outcomes, but this is not typically described as painful. The immediate sedation and subsequent medical interventions usually mitigate any potential pain associated with the overdose[1][5].\n\n### Recommendations\n- Given the potential for long-term effects, it is advisable to follow up with your healthcare provider for:\n  - Kidney function tests to ensure there is no ongoing renal damage.\n  - Liver function tests to monitor for any signs of hepatic injury.\n  - Neuropsychiatric evaluations to address any persistent mood changes or other behavioral issues.\n  - Regular check-ups to monitor for any other potential long-term side effects.\n\nIn summary, while you may have felt normal after the initial overdose, it is essential to be vigilant about potential long-term health effects, especially regarding kidney and liver function, and to consult with your healthcare provider for appropriate monitoring and care."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, the red patches on your tongue could be related to several possible conditions. Here are some considerations and suggestions:\n\n## Oral Lichen Planus\nThe symptoms you described, such as red patches that can turn into white lesions, a burning sensation, and pain especially on contact, are consistent with oral lichen planus (OLP). OLP is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the mucous membranes inside the mouth, and it can manifest as red, swollen patches or white, lacy lesions[2][3][5].\n\n## Other Possible Causes\n- **Medication Side Effects**: Given your complex medication regimen, it is possible that the lesions could be a side effect of one of your medications. However, this seems less likely given the specific nature of your symptoms.\n- **Autoimmune Conditions**: Your history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune conditions could potentially contribute to the development of oral lesions, but the pattern you described is more typical of OLP.\n- **Oral Candidiasis**: This is another possible cause of oral lesions, especially if you are taking immunosuppressive medications. However, the description of the lesions and the absence of other typical candidiasis symptoms make this less likely.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Medical Consultation\nGiven the uncertainty and the need for a precise diagnosis, it would be beneficial to consult:\n- **A Dermatologist**: They can evaluate the skin and mucous membrane aspects, but they may also refer you to a specialist who deals more specifically with oral conditions.\n- **An Oral Pathologist or an Oral Medicine Specialist**: These professionals specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the oral mucosa and would be ideal for evaluating your symptoms.\n- **A Rheumatologist**: Since you have SLE, it might also be helpful to consult your rheumatologist to rule out any direct connection between your autoimmune condition and the oral lesions.\n\n### Diagnostic Steps\nA proper diagnosis may involve:\n- **Clinical Examination**: Your healthcare provider will examine your mouth and possibly other affected areas.\n- **Biopsy**: A tissue sample may be taken from the affected area to confirm the diagnosis under a microscope[4].\n- **Medical History Review**: A thorough review of your medications and medical history to identify any potential triggers.\n\n### Management and Treatment\nIf diagnosed with oral lichen planus, treatment options may include:\n- **Topical Corticosteroids**: These are often the first-line treatment for OLP and can be applied directly to the affected areas[5].\n- **Topical Immunosuppressants**: Medications like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus can be effective for managing symptoms[4][5].\n- **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoiding spicy, salty, or acidic foods, using a soft-bristled toothbrush, and maintaining good oral hygiene can help manage the condition[2][4].\n\nBy consulting the appropriate specialists and undergoing the necessary diagnostic steps, you can get a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment to manage your symptoms."

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the complex and troubling symptoms your cousin Fiona is experiencing, here are some key points and possibilities to consider:\n\n## Migraine and Seizure-Like Symptoms\n\n- Migraines in children can present with a wide range of symptoms, including severe head pain, nausea, vomiting, light and sound sensitivity, and visual disturbances. Some children may also experience aura, which are sensory disturbances that can include visual, sensory, or motor symptoms[1][5].\n\n## Overlap with Seizure Symptoms\n\n- There is a known overlap between migraine and seizure symptoms. Some people, especially those with epilepsy, have a higher prevalence of migraines, and vice versa. This overlap can make diagnosis challenging[2][4].\n\n## Migralepsy and Migraine with Aura\n\n- Migralepsy is a term used to describe cases where a migraine attack with aura is followed by symptoms characteristic of epilepsy. However, this is rare and typically involves more specific neurological symptoms during the aura phase[2].\n\n## Occipital Lobe Seizures\n\n- Occipital lobe seizures can mimic migraine headaches due to similar symptoms such as visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. These seizures often involve visual hallucinations and can be triggered by visual stimuli[3].\n\n## Possible Misdiagnosis\n\n- It is possible that Fiona's symptoms are being misinterpreted or not fully understood. The combination of migraine-like symptoms (such as light sensitivity and severe headaches) along with seizure-like episodes (shaking, twitching, trouble breathing) could suggest an underlying condition that is not being accurately diagnosed.\n\n## Need for Comprehensive Evaluation\n\n- Given the complexity and frequency of Fiona's episodes, a comprehensive evaluation by specialists in neurology, headache disorders, and possibly epilepsy is crucial. This might involve detailed EEGs, MRIs, and other diagnostic tests to rule out underlying conditions that could be causing these symptoms[5].\n\n## Medication Impact\n\n- While the doctors have suggested that the symptoms might be due to medication, it is important to note that Fiona is currently only taking Tylenol in moderation. However, previous frequent use of migraine medications could have had an impact, and this should be thoroughly investigated.\n\n## Psychological Evaluation\n\n- Although Fiona has no history of depression or psychological issues, a psychological evaluation might still be helpful to rule out any underlying mental health conditions that could be contributing to or exacerbating her symptoms.\n\n## Specialist Consultation\n\n- The decision to consult specialists in a larger medical center, such as in Philadelphia, is a good step. Experts in pediatric neurology and headache disorders may be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIn summary, Fiona's symptoms suggest a complex neurological condition that could involve both migraine and seizure-like components. A thorough and multidisciplinary approach is necessary to determine the underlying cause and develop an effective treatment plan."

        "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your husband's medical history and the recent MRI results, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Encephalomalacia and Gliosis Post-Surgery\nIt is not uncommon for some degree of encephalomalacia (softening of brain tissue) and gliosis (scarring) to occur in the area adjacent to where a lesion or encephalocele has been removed. These changes can result from the initial insult, the surgical procedure itself, or subsequent healing processes[1][4].\n\n## Clinical Implications\nThe presence of a new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri could be a potential cause for the recurrence of seizures. Here are a few considerations:\n\n### Seizure Risk\nEncephalomalacia can lead to the development of focal epilepsy, as it represents an area of damaged brain tissue that can act as a seizure focus. Studies have shown that epilepsy secondary to encephalomalacia can result in longer and more frequent seizures compared to other etiologies[1].\n\n### Need for Additional Support or Surgery\nThe MRI results indicate no evidence of a mass, suspicious enhancement, or an epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain, but they do show changes near the previous surgical site. This suggests that the current seizures might be related to the new encephalomalacia and gliosis in this area.\n\n- **Pharmaceutical Support**: Your husband's neurologist may first consider adjusting his current antiseizure medication regimen (he is currently on Vimpat) to better control the seizures. If the seizures are well-controlled with medications, surgery might not be immediately necessary.\n  \n- **Surgical Evaluation**: However, if the seizures are not adequately controlled with medication adjustments, or if they increase in frequency or severity, further surgical evaluation might be considered. Surgery would be an option if a clear and localized seizure focus can be identified, and if removing that area would not cause significant brain function impairment[2][4].\n\n## Upcoming Appointment\nDuring your upcoming appointment with the neurologist, several aspects will likely be discussed:\n\n- **Medication Adjustment**: The neurologist may consider changing or adding medications to better manage the seizures.\n- **Monitoring**: Further monitoring with EEG or other diagnostic tests may be recommended to better understand the seizure dynamics and the potential epileptogenic focus.\n- **Surgical Reevaluation**: Depending on the severity and frequency of the seizures, and the results of further diagnostic tests, the possibility of another surgical intervention might be discussed.\n\nGiven the information, it is crucial to have a detailed discussion with the neurologist to understand the specific risks, benefits, and potential outcomes of each treatment option tailored to your husband's case."

        "question": "42 F Lamictal, cymbalta, singulair, levothyroxine, Pepcid, ambien 200lbs (significant weight gain in 3 years after injury to cervical spine - unable to run like I used to so I\u2019m confident that is the main reason why) 3-4 drinks per year, past prescription drug use (all prescribed but over used/abused) no addictive medications for almost 2 years besides ambien but now I\u2019m very careful. Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a seizure but it\u2019s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it\u2019s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. Thanks to all the doctors who visit this sub and offer help!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The sensations you are describing, where you experience sensory crossover (e.g., feeling sensations when you see certain actions or environments), are associated with a condition known as **synesthesia**.\n\n### What is Synesthesia?\nSynesthesia is a neurological phenomenon where the stimulation of one sensory pathway leads to an automatic, involuntary experience in another sensory pathway. For example, seeing numbers or letters in specific colors, tasting flavors when hearing certain sounds, or, in your case, feeling sensations or smelling environments triggered by visual stimuli.\n\n### Is Synesthesia Pseudoscience?\nNo, synesthesia is not pseudoscience. It is a well-documented and studied neurological condition. There is concrete evidence supporting its existence, including numerous scientific studies and brain imaging research. Synesthesia has been recognized and researched in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and neurology.\n\n### Is Synesthesia a Mental Disorder?\nSynesthesia is not classified as a mental disorder. It is generally considered a benign and even beneficial condition for many people. Synesthetes often report that their experiences are pleasant and enhance their perception of the world.\n\n### Could This Be Related to Your Medication or Epilepsy?\nWhile the onset of your synesthetic experiences coincides with the control of your epilepsy through medication, there is no clear evidence that antiepileptic medications directly cause synesthesia. However, changes in brain activity and connectivity due to medication or the control of seizures might influence the manifestation of synesthetic experiences. It is essential to discuss this with your neurologist to understand any potential links, but it is unlikely to be a sign of a downward turn in your mental health.\n\n### Conclusion\nSynesthesia is a recognized neurological condition with a significant body of scientific research supporting its existence. It is not a mental disorder and is generally not harmful. If you have concerns about your specific experiences, it would be best to continue discussing them with your healthcare providers to ensure there are no underlying issues that need to be addressed."

IMPRESSION:   Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right which may be related to microvascular ischemic change with demyelinating disease not excluded.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "To help alleviate your anxiety and understand the findings in your MRI report, here is a breakdown of the key sections and terms:\n\n## Technique and Comparison\n- The MRI was conducted using multiplanar, multisequence images of the brain without the administration of intravenous contrast. This means multiple angles and types of MRI sequences were used to provide a comprehensive view.\n- The comparison is made with an MRI from December 5, 2018, which helps in assessing any changes over time.\n\n## Findings\n### Hemorrhage\n- There is no evidence of acute or subacute hemorrhage in the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space, or extra-axial spaces. This is a positive finding indicating no recent bleeding.\n\n### DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging)\n- No evidence of acute or early subacute infarction. This means there are no signs of recent stroke or brain tissue damage due to lack of blood flow.\n\n### Brain\n- **No mass effect or edema**: There is no swelling or pressure from a mass that could be affecting brain structures.\n- **No significant atrophy or chronic microvascular ischemic changes**: There is no significant loss of brain tissue volume or chronic damage from small blood vessel disease.\n- **Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right**: This indicates small, scattered areas of abnormal signal in the white matter of the right side of the brain. On T2 and FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) sequences, these abnormalities can suggest various conditions such as:\n  - Microvascular ischemic changes: Small vessel disease that affects blood flow.\n  - Demyelinating disease: Conditions like multiple sclerosis where the protective covering of nerve fibers (myelin) is damaged[3][5].\n\n### Ventricles, Calvarium, Paranasal Sinuses, Mastoid Air Cells\n- These are all described as \"unremarkable,\" meaning they appear normal and show no signs of abnormalities.\n\n## Impression\nThe impression section summarizes the key findings and provides an interpretation:\n- **Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right**: This suggests there are small areas of abnormality in the white matter on the right side of the brain.\n- **May be related to microvascular ischemic change with demyelinating disease not excluded**: The radiologist is suggesting that these abnormalities could be due to small vessel disease or possibly a demyelinating condition, although the latter is not confirmed.\n\n### Clinical Context\nGiven your history of left temporal lobe epilepsy and recent increase in migraines and headaches, these findings should be considered in the context of your overall clinical presentation. Here are a few points to note:\n\n- **Epilepsy and Migraine**: There is a known overlap between epilepsy and migraine, and shared pathophysiology might contribute to your symptoms. However, the MRI findings do not directly link to your epilepsy or migraines but indicate other potential issues that need further evaluation[2].\n- **Medications**: Your current medications, such as Lamotrigine and Topamax, are used to manage both epilepsy and migraines. Propranolol is often used for migraines, and Ubrelvy is a more recent addition for acute migraine treatment.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Discuss these findings with your neurologist to understand the implications and whether further testing or changes in your treatment plan are necessary.\n- Given the possibility of microvascular ischemic changes or demyelinating disease, your doctor may recommend additional tests or consultations with a specialist.\n\nIt's important to remember that while these findings are noted, they do not necessarily indicate a severe or urgent condition. Your healthcare provider will help you interpret these results in the context of your overall health and clinical history."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Using NyQuil, or any similar medication containing the active ingredients found in NyQuil, with your specific health conditions requires careful consideration.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n### Epilepsy\nAlthough you mentioned your epilepsy is mild and not triggered by the ingredients in NyQuil, it is crucial to consult your doctor. Certain ingredients, such as dextromethorphan (DXM), can potentially interact with neurological conditions. However, there is no direct indication that NyQuil would trigger seizures, but it's always best to get medical advice[1][5].\n\n### ADHD and Anxiety\n- NyQuil contains doxylamine, an antihistamine that can cause drowsiness, but it may also interact with anxiety and ADHD. For some people, especially younger individuals, NyQuil can cause nervous anxiety or agitation instead of drowsiness[4].\n- Additionally, if you are taking any medications for ADHD or anxiety, even if not currently, it is important to note that DXM can interact with certain mood-affecting drugs, including antidepressants containing SSRIs, which can trigger anxiety attacks and other adverse effects[4].\n\n### Sleep Aid\nWhile NyQuil can help with sleep due to its drowsiness-inducing effects from doxylamine, it is not recommended as a long-term sleep aid. The medication can leave you feeling groggy the next day and should be used only to relieve symptoms associated with colds, flu, or allergies[2][4].\n\n## Precautions\n\n- **Drowsiness and Dizziness**: NyQuil can cause significant drowsiness and dizziness, which could be exacerbated by ADHD and anxiety. This could increase the risk of accidents or falls, especially in the morning after taking the medication[2][5].\n- **Interactions**: Avoid taking NyQuil with other medications that could interact with its ingredients, especially if you have a history of taking medications for ADHD or anxiety[1][5].\n\n## Recommendation\n\nGiven your conditions, it is highly recommended to consult your doctor or pharmacist before using NyQuil. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific health situation and help you weigh the benefits and risks of using this medication. Additionally, they might suggest alternative sleep aids or strategies that are safer and more effective for you."

        "question": " 50F in Australia, on carbimazole and levetiracetam for Graves\u2019 and epilepsy, respectively. FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the mechanism of your injury, it is prudent to seek medical attention as soon as possible, even if it means going to the Emergency Department (ED) for an X-ray.\n\n### Reasons to Seek Immediate Attention\n\n1. **Location and Type of Pain**: The pain near the base of your thumb and radiating down the inside of your wrist could indicate a fracture in one of the wrist bones, such as a scaphoid fracture or a distal radius fracture. These injuries are common in FOOSH (Falling On Out-Stretched Hand) incidents and can have serious complications if not treated promptly[2][3][5].\n\n2. **Symptoms of Fracture**: Symptoms like pain, especially when gripping or moving the wrist, and the presence of numbness initially, suggest a possible fracture or significant injury. These symptoms need to be evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out more severe injuries[2][3][5].\n\n3. **Risk of Complications**: Delaying treatment for wrist fractures, particularly those involving the scaphoid bone, can lead to poor blood flow, bone loss, and long-term complications such as arthritis. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for proper healing and preventing these complications[3][5].\n\n4. **Impact on Healing**: Early treatment can help reduce pain, swelling, and the risk of complications. Waiting until Monday could delay the healing process and potentially worsen the outcome[2][4][5].\n\n### Immediate Actions\n\n- **Seek an X-ray**: Given the symptoms you've described, an X-ray is necessary to confirm whether there is a fracture. The ED can provide this diagnostic service even if the local medical centre's radiology office is closed[2][5].\n\n- **Follow RICE Method**: While waiting for medical attention, apply the RICE method: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation to help manage pain and swelling[1][3][4].\n\n- **Medical Evaluation**: A healthcare professional will need to assess your injury through a physical examination and imaging tests to determine the best course of treatment, which could include immobilization, physical therapy, or surgery[2][4][5].\n\nGiven your current symptoms and the potential for serious complications, it is advisable to visit the ED for an immediate evaluation and X-ray, rather than waiting until Monday."

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation and the information provided, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Medication Expiry and Effectiveness\nYour neurologist suggested that even though the lamotrigine bottles had not expired, the effectiveness might decrease as they approach the expiry date, especially if they were manufactured several years prior. This is a reasonable concern, as the potency of medications can degrade over time, even if they are still within the expiry date. The change in blood levels you observed after switching to newer bottles supports this idea[1].\n\n## Blood Levels and Seizure Control\nYour experience shows a correlation between the blood levels of lamotrigine and the control of your seizures. When your blood levels dropped (e.g., 6.3 on 10/31/19), you had more seizures, and when you switched to newer bottles, your levels increased (e.g., 9.2 on 11/22/19), and you experienced better seizure control. This suggests that maintaining optimal blood levels is crucial for managing your epilepsy[1].\n\n## Current Medication and Expiry\nGiven that your current medication expires in August 2022 and you have newer bottles expiring in June 2023, it might be prudent to switch to the newer bottles to ensure optimal effectiveness. Since you cannot get your blood levels checked immediately, switching to the newer medication could help maintain better seizure control.\n\n## Dosage Form and Blood Levels\nThe change from three 200mg XR tablets to two 300mg XR tablets should not significantly affect your blood levels, as the extended-release (XR) formulation is designed to release the medication at a consistent rate over time. However, it is always good to monitor your response and consult your neurologist if you notice any changes in seizure control or side effects[5].\n\n## Recommendations\n- Consider switching to the newer bottles of lamotrigine to avoid any potential decrease in effectiveness due to age.\n- Monitor your seizure control and any side effects after the switch.\n- Consult your neurologist to discuss any changes in your medication regimen and to address your concerns about the expiry dates and dosage formulation.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help ensure that your medication remains effective in controlling your seizures."

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The explanation provided by the neurologist in your friend's case appears highly unlikely and does not align with the medical understanding of neonatal seizures. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Causes of Neonatal Seizures\nNeonatal seizures are typically caused by serious underlying conditions, such as:\n- Lack of oxygen before or during birth (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, HIE)[1][3][5].\n- Infections (e.g., bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis)[1][3][5].\n- Brain injuries, including trauma during birth, blood clots, or bleeding in the brain[1][3][5].\n- Metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, maple syrup urine disease)[1][5].\n- Stroke or other vascular events[1][3].\n\n## Symptoms and Diagnosis\nNeonatal seizures can be subtle and may include jerking movements, chewing motions, or \"bicycling\" movements. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is crucial for diagnosing neonatal seizures, and other imaging tests like MRI or CT scans may be used to determine the underlying cause[1][3][5].\n\n## Treatment\nTreatment usually involves anticonvulsant medications such as phenobarbital, lorazepam, or phenytoin to control the seizures. For babies with HIE, hypothermia treatment (cooling the baby's brain and body) may be used to reduce brain injury[1][3][5].\n\n## The Neurologist's Explanation\nThe neurologist's suggestion that the mother's hunger, cold, or fear during delivery could cause the baby to have seizures three days later is not medically plausible. Neonatal seizures are not caused by such indirect and delayed mechanisms.\n\n## Concerns and Next Steps\nGiven the repetitive nature of the seizures and the seriousness of potential underlying causes, it is essential for the baby to receive thorough and ongoing medical evaluation. The family should press for a comprehensive investigation to identify the true cause of the seizures, as timely and accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate treatment and prognosis.\n\nIn summary, while the test results so far may seem positive, the recurring seizures indicate a need for further investigation to determine the underlying cause, which is likely to be more serious than the neurologist's initial explanation. Encouraging the family to seek a second opinion or further diagnostic testing would be prudent."

        "question": "So I'm an 18 yr old Caucasian male (62kg,180cm). Since some months ago, I have constant depersonalization/dereaalization and periods of confusion that really bother me. I went to a neurologist and had an MRI scan(which turned out fine, except for some normal anatomical variants) and I was wondering if my confusion and dpdr can be the result of epilepsy ?(non-convulsive seizures). Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While it is possible for depersonalization and derealization symptoms to be associated with epilepsy, there are several factors to consider in your case:\n\n## Depersonalization and Derealization in Epilepsy\nDepersonalization and derealization can indeed occur in the context of epilepsy, particularly in cases involving specific brain regions. Studies have shown that:\n- Depersonalization-like symptoms are often associated with frontal lobe epilepsy, specifically with the epileptogenic zone located in the dorsal premotor cortex[1][4].\n- Derealization-like symptoms, on the other hand, are more commonly linked to temporal lobe epilepsy[1][4].\n\n## Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE)\nNon-convulsive status epilepticus can present with a variety of symptoms, including confusion, altered mental status, and bizarre behaviors, but these typically involve continuous EEG evidence of seizure activity. NCSE can be challenging to diagnose without EEG confirmation, and it often presents with subtle clinical manifestations such as decreased responsiveness, confusion, and speech disturbances[2][5].\n\n## Your Specific Case\n- You have undergone an MRI scan which showed only normal anatomical variants and no significant abnormalities. This reduces the likelihood of a structural brain abnormality as the cause.\n- The symptoms of depersonalization and derealization you are experiencing could be part of a dissociative disorder, such as depersonalization-derealization disorder, which is often linked to intense stress or trauma rather than epilepsy[3].\n\n## Next Steps\nTo determine if your symptoms are related to epilepsy, specifically non-convulsive seizures:\n- Your neurologist may recommend further diagnostic tests such as an EEG to check for ongoing seizure activity.\n- A detailed clinical evaluation and possibly video-EEG monitoring could help differentiate between epilepsy-related symptoms and other conditions.\n- Given the absence of clear EEG evidence or significant MRI findings, it may also be beneficial to consult with a psychiatrist to rule out or diagnose a dissociative disorder.\n\nIn summary, while epilepsy could be a cause, it is not the only possibility, and a comprehensive evaluation including both neurological and psychiatric assessments is necessary to accurately diagnose and manage your symptoms."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the complex and varied symptoms presented by the 31-year-old female, several potential diagnoses and contributing factors need to be considered:\n\n## Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\n- Despite the initial workup showing stable C3 and C4 levels, which led to lupus being dismissed, the recent increase in ANA titer (from 1:160 to 1:320) and other symptoms warrant reevaluation. SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:\n  - Seizures, particularly if the central nervous system is affected[1][3][5].\n  - Chronic low potassium levels, which can be due to kidney involvement or other metabolic disturbances.\n  - Anemia, which is common in SLE.\n  - Fluctuating GFR indicating possible kidney involvement (lupus nephritis).\n  - Small blood clots and bruising, suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome, which is associated with SLE.\n  - Joint swelling and pain, despite a negative RA factor.\n  - Visual disturbances, such as seeing black lines, and neurological symptoms like drop foot, eye palsy, and neuropathy, which can be due to central nervous system involvement.\n  - Raynaud's phenomenon and unprovoked tachycardia with PVCs are also consistent with SLE[1][3][5].\n\n## Electrolyte Disturbances\n- Chronic low potassium (hypokalemia) can contribute to muscle weakness, fatigue, and arrhythmias but is less likely to cause seizures directly. However, it can be part of a broader metabolic issue related to SLE or another underlying condition[2][4].\n\n## Other Considerations\n- The presence of seizures, particularly with a family history of epilepsy and a personal history of TBI, complicates the diagnosis. However, the onset of new symptoms like small blood clots and bruising, and significant pain followed by bruising, points more towards an autoimmune or vascular issue rather than solely a neurological one.\n- The symptoms of aphasia and dysphagia, along with visual disturbances and potential stroke-like symptoms, suggest central nervous system involvement, which is consistent with SLE or another autoimmune disorder.\n\n## Recommendation\nGiven the complexity of the symptoms and the initial dismissal of lupus based on stable C3 and C4 levels, a comprehensive reevaluation for SLE is necessary. This should include:\n- Repeating the ANA panel and other specific lupus tests (e.g., antibodies to double-stranded DNA, complement components).\n- Conducting a thorough kidney function assessment, including a kidney biopsy if necessary.\n- Evaluating for antiphospholipid syndrome and other associated conditions.\n- Consulting a rheumatologist for a detailed assessment and management plan.\n\nAdditionally, ongoing monitoring of electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, and managing any electrolyte imbalances is crucial to prevent further complications. The neurological symptoms should also be evaluated further, possibly with additional imaging and neurological consultations."

        "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",

        "answer": "Given your mother's situation, there are several factors and potential adjustments to consider to better manage her absence seizures and overall quality of life.\n\n## Reasons for Increased Seizure Activity\n\n### Stress and Anxiety\nStress and anxiety are well-documented triggers for seizures, including absence seizures. The recent increase in stress and feelings of isolation, especially after her return from India, could be exacerbating her condition[2][3][5].\n\n### Medication Efficacy\nThe medications she is currently taking (Trileptal and Keppra) may not be as effective as they once were, or there might be interactions with other medications she is taking for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. It's crucial to review her medication regimen with her neurologist to ensure the current doses are optimal and to consider any potential interactions[2][3].\n\n### Psychological Aspect\nThe psychological impact of her situation should not be underestimated. The feeling of isolation and the stress of adjusting to life changes can indeed contribute to an increase in seizure activity. Consulting a psychologist, as planned, can help address these issues through stress management techniques, counseling, and possibly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage anxiety and depression[2][3].\n\n## Additional Considerations and Actions\n\n### Review and Adjust Medication\n- Consult with her neurologist to assess whether the current medication dosages are adequate or if a change in medication or dosage is needed. Other anti-seizure medications like ethosuximide, lamotrigine, or valproic acid might be considered for absence seizures[2][3][5].\n\n### Lifestyle Modifications\n- **Stress Reduction**: Encourage stress-reducing activities such as yoga, meditation, or other relaxation techniques.\n- **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure she maintains a regular sleep schedule and avoids sleep deprivation, which is a known trigger for seizures[2][3].\n- **Avoid Triggers**: Identify and avoid specific triggers such as hyperventilation, flashing lights, or other visual stimulations that might provoke seizures[3][5].\n\n### Safety Precautions\n- Since she is experiencing multiple absence seizures a day and has accidentally injured herself, it is crucial to implement safety measures. This could include removing sharp objects from her environment, installing safety rails in the bathroom, and having someone accompany her during daily activities to prevent falls or injuries.\n\n### Multidisciplinary Care\n- In addition to her neurologist and psychologist, consider involving other healthcare professionals such as a psychiatrist (if necessary), a social worker to address isolation, and an occupational therapist to help with lifestyle adaptations and safety measures.\n\n### Monitoring and Testing\n- Regular EEG tests can help monitor the effectiveness of her current treatment and identify any changes in her brain activity. Other tests such as blood tests, kidney and liver tests, and imaging studies (CT or MRI scans) might be necessary to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the increase in seizures[3][5].\n\n### Support Network\n- Encourage her to connect with support groups for people with epilepsy to help her feel less isolated and to gain additional insights from others who are managing similar conditions.\n\nBy addressing both the medical and psychological aspects of her condition and implementing necessary lifestyle modifications and safety measures, you can work towards improving her quality of life and better managing her absence seizures."

        "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing. Could that be something that is going on? I was just curious!

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Your intense and recurring cravings for vinegar and other acidic foods could be indicative of several underlying factors. Here are some potential explanations:\n\n## Low Stomach Acid\nOne of the most common reasons for craving acidic foods like vinegar is low stomach acid production, a condition known as hypochlorhydria. Low stomach acid can impair the digestion of proteins and the absorption of minerals, leading your body to seek out acidic foods to compensate. This is supported by sources that suggest craving vinegary or acidic foods may indicate a need for the body to trigger the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach[3][5].\n\n## Nutrient Deficiencies\nVinegar, although low in nutrients, contains trace amounts of minerals like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and iron. If your diet is lacking in these nutrients, your body might be craving vinegar as a way to obtain them. This is particularly relevant if you have a diet that is high in carbs and sugar, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies and an imbalance in gut bacteria[2].\n\n## Gut Health and Candida Overgrowth\nCravings for vinegar could also be related to gut health issues, such as candida overgrowth. Vinegar has antimicrobial properties that can help combat bad bacteria in the stomach, which might be causing digestive discomfort. A diet lacking in variety and high in processed foods can contribute to this issue[1].\n\n## Hormonal and Chemical Imbalances\nCravings can sometimes be linked to hormonal or chemical imbalances in the body. Since you experience these cravings periodically and they seem to be intense, it could be related to fluctuations in your body's internal environment, possibly exacerbated by stress or other factors[5].\n\n## Specific Health Conditions\nGiven your medical history, including migraines, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and the use of medications like verapamil and singulair, it is possible that your body's metabolic and digestive processes are being influenced in ways that lead to these cravings. However, there is no direct evidence to link these conditions specifically to vinegar cravings.\n\n## Practical Steps\nTo better manage your cravings and understand their underlying causes, you might consider the following:\n- **Check Stomach Acid Levels**: Consult with a healthcare provider to evaluate your stomach acid production and consider supplements if necessary[4].\n- **Dietary Adjustments**: Ensure your diet is varied and includes foods rich in minerals and nutrients that vinegar provides.\n- **Gut Health**: Incorporate fermented foods like lacto-fermented pickles, sauerkraut, and other probiotic-rich foods to improve gut health.\n- **Hydration and Digestion**: Drink a small glass of room temperature water with a tablespoon of vinegar before meals to help stimulate stomach acid production[4].\n\nWhile your cravings do not seem to negatively impact your life significantly, understanding and addressing the underlying causes can help maintain overall health and digestive well-being."

I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don\u2019t feel quite normal at the moment and I\u2019m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it\u2019s my first ever post on Reddit and I\u2019m just very confused about what\u2019s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history and the symptoms you've described, it is crucial to seek medical advice to determine the cause of your episodes.\n\n### Past Seizures\n- Your past episodes, particularly those described as tonic-clonic seizures, are significant. Tonic-clonic seizures involve a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening (tonic phase), and rhythmic convulsions (clonic phase)[1][3][4].\n  - The triggers you mentioned (smoking weed and the nose piercing incident) could have been factors, but it's important to understand if these were isolated incidents or part of a broader condition.\n\n### Recent Episode\n- Your recent experience, characterized by panic, dizziness, heat, shakiness, and a feeling of disconnection, could be indicative of several things:\n  - **Focal Seizure:** Focal seizures can cause a range of symptoms depending on the area of the brain affected. These can include abnormal sensations, emotions, or movements, and sometimes a loss of awareness or consciousness. The aura you described (feeling panicky, disconnected) could be a precursor to a seizure[2][5].\n  - **Anxiety or Panic Attack:** Given your history of anxiety and depression, it's possible that this was an anxiety or panic attack. However, the duration and specific symptoms you mentioned, such as staring and rocking, suggest it might be more complex.\n\n### Post-Ictal Phase\n- After your recent episode, you experienced confusion, staring, and rocking, which are similar to the postictal phase seen after tonic-clonic seizures. During this phase, individuals often feel confused, tired, and may have headaches or other symptoms[3][4].\n\n### Mental Health\n- While your mental health conditions (depression, anxiety) could contribute to some of your symptoms, the specific nature of your episodes suggests a need to rule out any underlying neurological conditions.\n\n### Action Steps\n1. **Seek Medical Advice:** It is essential to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist, to evaluate your history and current symptoms. They may recommend tests such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) to assess your brain activity.\n2. **Keep a Seizure Diary:** Document any future episodes, including the time, duration, and details of what happened before, during, and after the event.\n3. **Discuss Triggers:** Inform your doctor about any potential triggers, including past substance use and any medical procedures.\n4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation will help differentiate between neurological and psychological causes.\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and the potential for underlying neurological conditions, it is crucial to seek a professional medical evaluation to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment."

The lump happened to appear after the injury. It wasn\u2019t super painful so I kept on skating after a few more incidents to the same area I decided to take a break. I\u2019m about a week removed from skating and haven\u2019t seen a noticeable improvement. No pain. Just sensitive to the touch. Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the context of your skateboarding injury, here are some potential issues you might be experiencing:\n\n## Ankle Sprains and Overuse Injuries\nAnkle sprains, particularly inversion sprains, are common in skateboarders. However, since the lump appeared after the injury and is located on the medial side of the distal tibia, it might not be a simple sprain. Overuse injuries such as anterior ankle impingement or \"hot pockets\" could also be a consideration, but these typically present with pain and stiffness rather than a distinct lump[1][3].\n\n## Bone Related Issues\nThe presence of a lump on the distal tibia suggests there could be a bone-related issue. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n### Stress Fracture\nStress fractures, which are small cracks in the bone, can occur due to repetitive stress and trauma. These are common in skateboarders, especially if proper footwear and landing techniques are not used. A stress fracture could result in a localized swelling or lump, especially if it has not healed properly over the past three weeks[2][3][4].\n\n### Bone Contusion or Hematoma\nA bone contusion or a hematoma (a collection of blood outside of blood vessels) could also result from repetitive trauma to the ankle. This could cause a lump that is sensitive to the touch but not necessarily painful.\n\n### Fracture or Avulsion Fracture\nAlthough less likely if there was no significant pain, a small fracture or avulsion fracture (where a piece of bone is pulled off by a tendon or ligament) could also be a possibility. These would typically require immediate medical attention but might not always present with severe pain, especially if they are minor[2][3].\n\n## Medical Evaluation\nGiven that the lump has not improved after a week of rest and is sensitive to the touch, it is crucial to have it evaluated by a medical professional. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. **Consult a Doctor**: Visit an orthopedic specialist or a podiatrist who can assess the injury. They will likely perform a physical examination and may order imaging tests such as X-rays or an MRI to determine the exact nature of the lump[2][3][4].\n\n2. **RICE Method**: Continue with the RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) as a general treatment approach for ankle injuries, but this may not be sufficient if the issue is more serious.\n\n3. **Avoid Further Activity**: Until the issue is diagnosed and treated, avoid any further skateboarding or activities that could exacerbate the injury.\n\nGiven your existing medical condition of epilepsy and your current medication (Keppra), it is also important to inform your healthcare provider about these factors to ensure any treatment plan is appropriate for your overall health."

Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your relative's complex and evolving symptoms, it is crucial to approach her condition with a comprehensive and multidisciplinary perspective. Here are some key points and considerations:\n\n## Epilepsy Diagnosis and Treatment\n- Your relative has been diagnosed with epilepsy following a shaking seizure, and she has been on various antiseizure medications. However, the medications have not fully controlled her seizures, and she continues to experience episodes of losing consciousness[1][3][4].\n\n## Potential MS Involvement\n- The mention of MS by neurologists, although later withdrawn, suggests there might be some neurological complexity. Studies indicate that people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have a higher risk of developing epilepsy and seizures compared to the general population. If MS is a possibility, it could explain some of the diverse symptoms she is experiencing[2][5].\n\n## Menstrual Cycle and Seizures\n- The observation that her seizures seem to occur around her menstrual cycle is noteworthy. Hormonal changes can influence seizure activity in some individuals, a condition known as catamenial epilepsy. This could be a factor to discuss with her neurologist to adjust her treatment accordingly[1][3].\n\n## New Symptoms\n- The recent episode where she lost memory of what she was doing and felt like she was on autopilot for a few seconds could indicate a different type of seizure, such as a focal seizure. These seizures can cause strange behaviors and sensations without the typical jerking or shaking associated with tonic-clonic seizures[3][4].\n\n## Steps to Consider\n\n### Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation\n- It is important to have a thorough neurological evaluation that includes detailed EEGs, MRIs, and possibly other tests like PET scans or magnetoencephalography (MEG) to better understand the type and origin of her seizures.\n\n### Specialist Consultation\n- Consult with a specialist in epilepsy or a neurologist who has experience in managing complex seizure cases. Given the potential overlap with MS, a consultation with an MS specialist might also be beneficial.\n\n### Medication Review\n- Review her current medication regimen with her neurologist. It may be necessary to adjust the medications or consider alternative treatments such as surgery, a ketogenic diet, or devices like vagus nerve stimulators if medications are not effective[1][3].\n\n### Lifestyle Adjustments\n- Encourage her to keep a seizure diary to track when seizures occur, any potential triggers, and how she feels before and after the seizures. This can help identify patterns and insights that might aid in managing her condition.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Given the risk of injuries from falls, it is crucial to ensure her safety. This might include removing hazards from her living environment, using protective gear, and having a plan in place for when seizures occur.\n\n### Psychological Support\n- Living with uncontrolled seizures can be highly stressful and affect mental health. Encourage her to seek psychological support or counseling to help cope with the emotional and social impacts of her condition.\n\n### Work and Daily Activities\n- Discuss with her employer or potential employers about her condition and the need for accommodations to ensure her safety at work. There may also be support groups or resources available to help individuals with epilepsy manage their daily lives.\n\nBy coordinating a thorough medical evaluation, adjusting her treatment plan as necessary, and implementing safety and lifestyle adjustments, you can help your relative better manage her condition and improve her quality of life."

        "question": "25F white JME keppra 1gMy epilepsy seems very well controlled with keppra. No complaints.Lately I've been feeling really tired, but I'm getting good sleep. I don't have any signs of seizures when I wake up. It's always been hard to wake up in the mornings, but lately it's been awful. It feels like I didn't sleep at all.I was working today. I closed my eyes to blink, and everything was kinda dizzy, but it went away quick. It's hard to describe, it's kinda like dizziness, but also like everything's... dropping? Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing could be related to several factors associated with Keppra (levetiracetam) or other aspects of your epilepsy management. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n### Fatigue and Sleepiness\nFatigue and sleepiness are common side effects of Keppra, and they can persist even after long-term use. These symptoms are often reported during the initial phases of treatment but can continue in some patients[2][4][5].\n\n### Dizziness and Vertigo\nThe dizziness and the sensation of everything \"dropping\" or \"melting\" you described are also consistent with side effects of Keppra. Dizziness and vertigo are listed among the common adverse reactions to the medication[2][4][5].\n\n### Blood Cell Problems\nKeppra can cause blood cell problems, including decreased white blood cells, red blood cells, and hemoglobin. These issues can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and infections. It might be worth discussing with your doctor whether your fatigue could be related to any underlying blood cell problems[1][5].\n\n### Long-term Use and Tolerance\nWhile Keppra is not known to \"wear off\" in the sense that its efficacy diminishes over time, the side effects can sometimes change or become more pronounced. If you've been on Keppra for 3-4 years, it's possible that your body has adjusted to some of the side effects, but new ones can still emerge or existing ones can worsen[4].\n\n### Mental and Physical Fatigue\nGiven that you have Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), it's also important to consider the broader impact of epilepsy on your sleep and fatigue levels. Disrupted sleep patterns and the general strain of managing epilepsy can contribute to fatigue, even if your seizures are well-controlled[3].\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: Discuss your symptoms with your doctor or epilepsy specialist. They can help determine if the fatigue and dizziness are side effects of Keppra or if there might be another underlying cause.\n- **Adjust Medication**: Your doctor may consider adjusting your dose or exploring other treatment options if the side effects are significantly impacting your daily life.\n- **Blood Tests**: Regular blood tests can help monitor any potential blood cell problems.\n- **Lifestyle Changes**: Ensuring a balanced diet, maintaining good sleep hygiene, and managing stress can also help mitigate fatigue and other side effects.\n\nIt is crucial to address these symptoms with your healthcare provider to ensure your overall well-being and to adjust your treatment plan if necessary."

        "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female 5,5 Ft, 160 Lbs Non smoker",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the complex and evolving symptoms your relative is experiencing, it's crucial to consider several factors and potential diagnoses.\n\n### Epilepsy\nYour relative has already been diagnosed with epilepsy following a shaking seizure, and she has been on various anti-epileptic medications. However, the ongoing fainting spells and other symptoms suggest that her condition may not be fully controlled. Epilepsy can cause a wide range of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, uncontrollable jerking, and strange sensations. The fact that she sometimes loses awareness and stares blankly into space or experiences memory lapses could be related to her epilepsy[1][4].\n\n### Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nThe neurologists' suggestion that she might have MS is significant, even though the corticosteroids were later withdrawn. MS can cause seizures, although they are not a common initial symptom. The prevalence of seizures in MS patients is higher than in the general population, and these seizures can be associated with disease progression and more severe disability[2][5].\n\n### Hormonal Influence\nThe observation that she often faints before her period suggests a possible hormonal component. Hormonal changes can influence seizure frequency in some people with epilepsy, a condition known as catamenial epilepsy. This could explain the periodic nature of her fainting spells[4].\n\n### Differentiating Between Seizures and Fainting\nIt is important to distinguish between seizures and fainting (syncope). Seizures typically last longer than 1 minute, can involve convulsions, loss of bladder or bowel control, tongue biting, and other specific signs. Fainting, on the other hand, is usually shorter, accompanied by symptoms like tunnel or blurred vision, nausea, cold sweats, and dilated pupils[3].\n\n### Recent Memory Lapse\nThe recent episode where she lost memory of what she was doing for a few seconds could be a type of seizure known as an absence seizure or a complex partial seizure. These seizures can cause brief periods of lost consciousness or being on \"autopilot\" without the typical convulsive symptoms[4].\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Given the complexity and variability of her symptoms, a comprehensive evaluation by a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and possibly MS is necessary. This may involve further MRI scans, EEG tests, and other diagnostic tools to better understand the underlying causes.\n- **Adjust Medication**: If her current anti-epileptic medications are not effectively controlling her seizures, a review and adjustment of her medication regimen might be necessary.\n- **Consider Hormonal Influence**: Discuss the possibility of catamenial epilepsy with her neurologist and explore whether her medication can be adjusted to account for the hormonal fluctuations.\n- **Safety Measures**: Ensure she takes safety precautions to prevent injuries during episodes, such as avoiding high-risk activities and ensuring she is in a safe environment.\n- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Since her condition affects her ability to work and has significant impacts on her quality of life, a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, psychologists, and possibly occupational therapists could be beneficial.\n\n### Questions to Ask the Neurologist\n- What is the likelihood that her symptoms are related to MS, and what specific tests can confirm or rule out this diagnosis?\n- How can her anti-epileptic medication be adjusted to better control her seizures and fainting spells?\n- Are there any specific precautions or lifestyle changes she can make to manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life?\n- Could hormonal changes be contributing to her symptoms, and if so, how can this be addressed?\n\nBy addressing these questions and seeking a thorough evaluation, you can help your relative receive more targeted and effective care."

        "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation, it is crucial to approach the cessation of Keppra with caution and under medical supervision. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Risk of Seizures\nWhile your seizures were triggered by postpartum eclampsia and your blood pressure is now under control, it is still important to consider the risk of seizures when stopping Keppra. Although you are not epileptic, the medication was prescribed to prevent further seizures during your recovery. Stopping Keppra abruptly could potentially increase the risk of another seizure, even if it is low[1][4].\n\n## Tapering Off Keppra\nIt is generally recommended to taper off Keppra rather than stopping it abruptly. This tapering process helps reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms, including an increase in seizure frequency. The duration and method of tapering will depend on your dose and the length of time you have been taking the medication. Typically, a tapering schedule can last from one to three months, and it should be designed by your supervising physician[1].\n\n## Withdrawal Symptoms\nWithdrawal from Keppra can include symptoms such as nasal congestion, decreased appetite, irritability, aggression, sleepiness, weakness, dizziness, and infections. Given your responsibility of caring for a newborn, it is important to minimize these potential side effects as much as possible[1].\n\n## Consultation with Neurologist\nDespite your neurologist's nonchalant attitude, it is essential to insist on a detailed discussion about your concerns. Emphasize the importance of being fully capable of caring for your newborn while tapering off the medication. Request a clear tapering schedule and ensure you understand the potential risks and how to manage them.\n\n## Monitoring\nDuring the tapering process, it is crucial to be continuously monitored, especially since you will be alone with your newborn for significant parts of the day. Ensure that you have a support system in place in case any withdrawal symptoms or seizures occur[1][4].\n\nIn summary:\n- You should not stop Keppra abruptly without a supervised tapering plan.\n- Tapering off Keppra can help minimize the risk of seizures and other withdrawal symptoms.\n- Insist on a detailed plan from your neurologist that addresses your specific concerns and ensures your safety and the safety of your newborn.\n- Maintain close communication with your healthcare provider throughout the tapering process."

        "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the diagnostic process you're undergoing, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Nature of the Lesion and Symptoms\n\n- The 8mm lesion on your brain, identified as vascular in nature, suggests it could be an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or another type of vascular malformation. AVMs are characterized by abnormal connections between arteries and veins, which can disrupt normal blood flow and lead to various symptoms[2][4][5].\n\n## Seizures vs. Vascular Issues\n\n- The episodes you described, including the electric shock sensations, convulsions, and loss of consciousness, can be indicative of seizures. Seizures are a common symptom of brain AVMs due to the abnormal blood flow and potential damage to surrounding brain tissue[2][4][5>.\n- However, it is also possible that these symptoms are directly related to the vascular issue itself, such as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a dissection, which can cause similar neurological symptoms.\n\n## Dissection/TIA and Seizures\n\n- A carotid artery dissection or a TIA can indeed cause neurological symptoms, including those that might resemble seizures. Dissections can lead to ischemia (reduced blood flow) in parts of the brain, which may result in symptoms like numbness, weakness, or even seizures. However, TIAs typically do not present with convulsions and loss of consciousness as primary symptoms[4].\n\n## Initial Attack\n\n- The initial attack, described with convulsions and loss of consciousness, is more suggestive of a seizure or a significant vascular event like a hemorrhage from an AVM rather than a typical TIA. The fact that you had no breathing during the attack further supports the severity of the event.\n\n## Long-term Medication and Epilepsy\n\n- If the diagnosis confirms that you are having seizures, whether due to the AVM or another cause, you may need to be on antiepileptic medications like Vimpat. The goal is to control the seizures and prevent further episodes. However, the need for long-term medication would depend on the underlying cause and the effectiveness of other treatments, such as surgical or radiological interventions for the AVM.\n- Developing epilepsy at age 35 is possible, especially if the underlying cause is a structural lesion like an AVM. However, the diagnosis of epilepsy requires recurring seizures, so further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine this.\n\n## Diagnostic Cerebral Angiogram\n\n- The diagnostic cerebral angiogram scheduled for tomorrow will provide more detailed information about the vascular structure and any potential anomalies, such as an AVM or a dissection. This will help your neurosurgeon and neurologist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\nGiven your comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension), it is crucial to manage these conditions to reduce the risk of further vascular complications and to work closely with your healthcare team to determine the best course of treatment for both the vascular lesion and any associated seizures."

        "question": "Why does my head feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking when I put my hands on my forehead and press them down into my pillow ? I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5\u20199 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I\u2019m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don\u2019t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress. They booked me in with a neurologist but it might take 3 week. What\u2019s wrong with me ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several potential explanations for the twitching and shaking sensations you are experiencing.\n\n## Medication Side Effects\nSince you are taking Epilim (valproic acid) for epilepsy, it is important to consider the possibility that your symptoms could be side effects of the medication. Valproic acid can cause various side effects, including:\n- Uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body[3]\n- Muscle twitching, myalgia, and myasthenia[2]\n- Problems with coordination and movement[3]\n\n## Movement Disorders\nThe twitching and shaking sensations could also be related to movement disorders. Here are some possibilities:\n- **Essential Tremor**: Though typically more noticeable in the hands, essential tremor can sometimes affect the head, especially when attempting movements or applying pressure[1].\n- **Myoclonus**: This condition involves sudden muscle spasms that can cause quick jerks, which might feel like twitching or shaking[1].\n- **Tardive Dyskinesia**: Although this is usually associated with long-term use of neuroleptic drugs, it is worth considering if there are any interactions with your current medication[1].\n\n## Stress and Muscle Fasciculation\nThe doctors you saw suggested that your symptoms might be due to stress and muscle fasciculation. Muscle fasciculation, which is the visible twitching of muscles under the skin, can indeed be triggered by stress and anxiety[5].\n\n## Other Medical Conditions\nWhile your neurologist previously indicated you would likely only have absence seizures, new symptoms should always be evaluated. Conditions like:\n- **Myasthenia Gravis**: Though rare, this could cause muscle weakness and twitching, especially noticeable in certain positions or after exertion[4].\n- **Other Neurological Conditions**: Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, or multiple system atrophy are less likely given your age and previous diagnosis, but they cannot be ruled out without further evaluation[1].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven the uncertainty and the recent onset of these symptoms, it is prudent to follow through with the neurologist appointment that has been scheduled. A thorough evaluation by a neurologist can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and guide appropriate treatment. In the meantime, keeping a detailed journal of when and how the twitching and shaking occur can be helpful for your neurologist to make a more accurate diagnosis."

        "question": "About a month ago i smoked a little weed with my friends at a pool and when i got out i started feeling extremely light headed so i went to go sit down on a lounge chair next thing i knew i was on the ground everything was completely black and i couldn't see or hear anything all i could feel was my body flopping around uncontrollably and i couldn't stop it. The whole experience only lasted about 15 seconds but it felt like 15 minutes then out of nowhere i was able to stand up and my vision cleared and i was fine if anyone has any experience with or knows why this happened please help me im scared there could be underlying health issues i never knew about (i smoke fairly frequently and it never happened prior to this incident or after any help would be greatly appreciated)Edit: mods removed my first post for not adding this so age and gender 16m weight 132lbs height 6'3 no medical issues aside from psychological and im on no medications",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The experience you described is likely related to the effects of cannabis on your cardiovascular and nervous systems, particularly in the context of the specific circumstances you were in.\n\n## Vasodilation and Blood Pressure Drop\nCannabis, especially THC, acts as a vasodilator, which means it widens blood vessels and can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure. This drop in blood pressure can lead to reduced blood flow to the brain, resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness, or even fainting (vasovagal syncope)[1][3][5].\n\n## Orthostatic Hypotension\nWhen you stood up after smoking cannabis, especially in a setting like a pool where you may have been exposed to heat and possibly dehydration, your body had to adjust to the change in position. This can lead to orthostatic hypotension, a condition where blood pressure drops quickly when standing up, increasing the risk of fainting[5].\n\n## Method of Consumption and Environment\nThe method of consumption (smoking) and the rapid entry of THC into your system can shock your body, leading to more pronounced effects, including dizziness and fainting. Additionally, environmental factors such as heat, dehydration, and the sudden change from being in the pool to standing and then sitting can exacerbate these effects[1][3].\n\n## Symptoms and Recovery\nThe symptoms you described, such as extreme lightheadedness, tunnel vision, and a temporary loss of consciousness, are consistent with fainting induced by cannabis use. The fact that you recovered quickly and were fine afterward suggests that it was likely a transient event related to the immediate effects of cannabis[1][3][5].\n\n## Underlying Health Issues\nWhile this incident could be an isolated response to cannabis use under specific conditions, it is important to consider any potential underlying health issues, especially given your age and height. However, since you mentioned you have no known medical issues aside from psychological ones and are on no medications, it is less likely to be related to a pre-existing condition.\n\n## Prevention\nTo prevent such incidents in the future, you might consider the following:\n- **Switch to lower-THC strains** or strains with higher CBD levels, which may mitigate the vasodilatory effects of THC[1][3].\n- **Stay hydrated** and avoid using cannabis in settings that might exacerbate dehydration or heat stress.\n- **Consume cannabis while sitting or lying down** to reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension[1][3].\n- **Avoid sudden changes in position** and take your time when standing up after using cannabis.\n\nIf such incidents occur again or if you have any further concerns, it would be wise to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying health issues."

        "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms and events you described for the mathematics docent could be indicative of several serious medical conditions, but given the context, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a stroke are strong possibilities. Here are some points to consider:\n\n### Symptoms Observed\n- **Sudden onset of symptoms**: The docent's sudden freezing, facial asymmetry (half of the face making a smile-like expression), and head turning are consistent with the sudden onset of neurological symptoms seen in TIAs or strokes[2][4][5].\n- **Unilateral weakness**: The docent's face and possibly other parts of his body showing weakness or unusual movements (e.g., unnatural laughter, stiffening, and falling) suggest unilateral weakness, a common symptom in TIAs and strokes[2][4][5].\n- **Loss of consciousness and confusion**: Being unconscious for 5-7 minutes and subsequent disorientation also align with the severe impact of a stroke or TIA[2][4][5].\n- **Trauma from the fall**: The blood from the ear and the reddish, scratched skin on the front left of his head indicate a potential skull fracture from hitting the board, which complicates the diagnosis but does not rule out an initial neurological event.\n\n### The Disturbing Laughter\nWhile the unnatural laughter is not a typical symptom described in standard TIA or stroke literature, it could be a manifestation of a seizure or a peculiar neurological response to the ischemic event. Seizures can sometimes occur in the context of stroke or TIA, especially if there is significant brain injury involved.\n\n### Immediate Actions\nGiven the severity of the symptoms and the potential for a stroke or TIA, the immediate call for an ambulance was the correct action. The medical team will need to perform thorough evaluations, including imaging tests like MRI or CT scans, to determine the exact cause of the docent's symptoms and any potential long-term damage.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\nWhile a TIA or stroke is highly likely, other conditions such as a seizure disorder or even a cardiac event leading to cerebral hypoperfusion could be considered. The medical team will need to take a comprehensive approach to diagnose and treat the underlying cause.\n\nIn summary, the observed symptoms strongly suggest a transient ischemic attack or a stroke, complicated by a possible head injury from the fall. The medical evaluation will be crucial in determining the exact diagnosis and necessary treatment."

        "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The situation you're describing is not entirely unusual, but it can be improved with a more streamlined approach to prescription management. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Annual Comprehensive Care Visits\nIt is recommended to synchronize all long-term medications, including those for chronic conditions like epilepsy, during an annual comprehensive care visit. This approach ensures that all prescriptions are renewed for the maximum duration allowed by state law, typically 12 to 15 months, which can help avoid gaps in medication adherence[1].\n\n## Prescription Renewal Process\nFor medications like Lamotrigine, which are crucial for managing conditions such as epilepsy, it is important to ensure continuous access. Your neurologist's current practice of renewing prescriptions only in 6-month increments and requiring an appointment for each renewal may not be the most efficient or patient-friendly approach. Ideally, prescriptions for chronic conditions should be renewed for the maximum duration to minimize the need for frequent renewals and appointments[1].\n\n## Managing Refills and Renewals\n- **Timing of Refills**: It is advisable to request a refill when you have about one week's supply left to account for any processing delays. This ensures you do not run out of medication[5].\n- **Communication with the Doctor**: If you are unable to schedule an appointment before your prescription runs out, it is crucial to communicate this to your doctor or their office. They should be able to provide a temporary solution or expedite the renewal process to avoid any gaps in treatment[4].\n\n## Controlled vs. Non-Controlled Substances\nSince Lamotrigine is not a controlled substance, it should be manageable to renew it without the stringent restrictions applied to controlled substances like narcotics or amphetamines[1].\n\n## Patient-Centric Approach\nA more patient-centric approach would involve renewing your prescription for the maximum allowed duration during your annual visit or at other scheduled visits, rather than requiring frequent appointments. This can be facilitated by including instructions for the pharmacy to synchronize all prescriptions to come due at the same time, reducing the need for multiple renewals throughout the year[1].\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Discuss with Your Neurologist**: During your upcoming appointment, discuss the possibility of synchronizing your prescriptions and renewing them for a longer duration to avoid future issues.\n- **Use a Team-Based Approach**: If your neurologist's office has a team-based approach (e.g., a refill nurse or medical assistant), they can help streamline the renewal process, reducing the need for frequent appointments[1].\n\nBy advocating for a more streamlined and patient-friendly prescription renewal process, you can ensure continuous access to your essential medication."

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your diagnosis of partial epilepsy and the symptoms you're experiencing, it's important to understand the potential impacts of epilepsy and its treatment on your cognitive functions.\n\n## Reversibility of Cognitive Symptoms\nThe cognitive symptoms you're experiencing, such as memory and concentration problems, can sometimes be improved with the right treatment. However, the reversibility of these symptoms depends on several factors:\n\n### Seizure Control\nEffective control of seizures is crucial. If the seizures are well-managed with medication like Carbamazepine (Zeptol), some of the cognitive symptoms may improve over time[4].\n\n### Medication Side Effects\nAnti-epilepsy medications, including Carbamazepine, can have side effects that affect cognitive functions such as thinking, remembering, and concentrating. These side effects can be temporary or persistent, and adjusting the medication or dose might help alleviate them[2][5,.\n\n### Underlying Brain Activity\nThe location and extent of the abnormal brain activity can influence the severity and reversibility of cognitive symptoms. If the seizures are affecting areas like the hippocampus, which is crucial for short-term memory, the impact could be more significant[1].\n\n## Hippocampus and Memory\nThe hippocampus plays a critical role in short-term memory processing. Seizures affecting this area can lead to significant memory issues. However, some people may experience improvement in memory functions once the seizures are controlled, although full recovery can vary[1].\n\n## Long-term Prognosis\nWhile it's concerning to consider the possibility of long-term cognitive decline, it's rare for epilepsy to directly lead to Alzheimer's disease in one's 30s. However, uncontrolled seizures and ongoing cognitive symptoms can impact the quality of life and may require ongoing management and adjustments to medication and lifestyle.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Follow-Up with Your Neurologist**: Continue to work closely with your neurologist to adjust your medication and monitor its effectiveness. It may take some time to find the right balance of medication that controls your seizures without exacerbating cognitive side effects.\n- **Cognitive Support**: Engage in cognitive support activities such as memory exercises, cognitive training programs, and lifestyle changes that support brain health.\n- **Regular Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups and cognitive assessments can help track any changes in your condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.\n\nIt's also important to note that an early and accurate diagnosis, along with appropriate treatment, can make a significant difference in managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life."

        "question": " Yet another EDIT: I fainted today on my way to the store and was brought into the hospital. They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder. Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your recent experiences and the tests you've undergone, here are some key points to help you understand your condition better:\n\n## Absence Seizures\n- The seizures you are experiencing, described as \"silent\" seizures where you lose consciousness but remain standing, are likely absence seizures. These are a type of epilepsy characterized by brief periods of lost consciousness, usually lasting a few seconds. During an absence seizure, you may have a blank stare, be very still, and then suddenly return to normal activity without any memory of the seizure[1][4].\n- Absence seizures can occur frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, and are often associated with children but can occur at any age.\n- Lack of sleep and anxiety can trigger these seizures, which aligns with your recent experiences.\n- An electroencephalogram (EEG) is the primary test used to diagnose absence seizures, and it sounds like you have already undergone this test[1][4].\n\n## Gastroparesis\n- The symptoms you described related to weight loss, lack of appetite, and inability to keep food down could be indicative of gastroparesis. This condition involves delayed stomach emptying, which can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, and a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food[2][5].\n- A gastric emptying study, which you have scheduled, is a key diagnostic test for gastroparesis. This test involves eating food mixed with a small amount of a radioactive substance, and then a scanner tracks how quickly the food leaves your stomach. If more than 10% of the food remains in your stomach after 4 hours, it may indicate gastroparesis[2][5].\n\n## Management and Next Steps\n- For absence seizures, treatment typically involves antiepileptic medications and lifestyle adjustments to manage triggers such as lack of sleep and anxiety.\n- For gastroparesis, treatment may include dietary changes (e.g., eating smaller, more frequent meals), medications to help empty the stomach, and in some cases, other interventions to manage symptoms and prevent complications like malnutrition and dehydration[2][5].\n\nIt is important to follow up with your healthcare providers to get a definitive diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment plan for both your absence seizures and potential gastroparesis. Keeping a detailed record of your symptoms and any triggers can also help your healthcare team in managing your conditions effectively."

        "question": "Age:18 Sex:F Weight:46 kg Height:1.61 cm So i have had histories of deja vu, it usually doesn\u2019t last long. I don\u2019t have them a lot, sometimes more sometime less. I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn\u2019t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can\u2019t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure. I have had no history of seizures before. I am so scared to sleep right now fearing that something might happen. It\u2019s probably about a year that this situation while i am trying to sleep happens. Wold really love to have an EEG bit when i went to the neurologist a year ago he only diagnosed me with anxiety combined with elements of OCD. He did some reflex/eyesight tests and all came back with no neurological deficit. I\u2019d get an EEG but i am literally such a hypochondriac that my parents are concerned and i just went through blood tests and i don\u2019t want to worry them again! If anyone has any idea i\u2019d be so glad :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and concerns, it's important to approach this situation with a balanced perspective, considering both the possibility of neurological issues and the impact of anxiety and OCD.\n\n### D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and Its Association with Epilepsy\n- D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can be a common phenomenon in both the general population and in individuals with epilepsy, particularly those with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the frequency and context of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can differ. In epilepsy, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can occur as an aura before a seizure or as part of the seizure itself[3][5\u0964\n\n### Other Symptoms You Described\n- **Head/Body Vibrations and Buzzing**: These sensations, especially when occurring at night and accompanied by nonsense thoughts and mild depersonalization, could be related to anxiety or stress. However, they could also be a sign of other neurological or psychological conditions.\n- **Heart Rate Increase and Depersonalization**: These can be symptoms of anxiety disorders, but they could also be associated with certain types of seizures or other neurological conditions.\n- **Dream Flashbacks**: While this can be a feature of various conditions, it does not specifically point towards epilepsy without other corroborative symptoms.\n\n### Previous Diagnosis and Tests\n- Your neurologist previously diagnosed you with anxiety combined with elements of OCD, and the reflex and eyesight tests showed no neurological deficits. This suggests that your symptoms might be more aligned with psychological rather than neurological disorders.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Consult Your Neurologist Again**: Given the persistence and variation of your symptoms, it would be wise to revisit your neurologist. Explain the new symptoms and the frequency of their occurrence.\n2. **EEG Consideration**: An EEG (electroencephalogram) could help determine if there are any abnormal electrical activities in the brain that might indicate epilepsy or other neurological conditions. Even though you had no neurological deficits previously, an EEG specifically targeting the periods when you experience these symptoms could provide valuable insights.\n3. **Comprehensive Psychological Evaluation**: Since anxiety and OCD have been diagnosed, continuing therapy and possibly adjusting your treatment plan could help manage these conditions and their symptoms.\n4. **Monitoring Symptoms**: Keeping a detailed journal of when these symptoms occur and any potential triggers can be helpful for both you and your healthcare provider.\n\n### Addressing Hypochondria\n- It's important to communicate your fears and concerns openly with your parents and healthcare provider. Hypochondria can exacerbate symptoms and create additional stress. Seeking support from a mental health professional may also be beneficial in managing these fears.\n\nIn summary, while your symptoms could have several explanations, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying neurological conditions and to manage your anxiety and OCD effectively."

I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, it is crucial to address your concerns about ovarian torsion promptly and effectively. Here are some key points and steps you can consider:\n\n## Symptoms of Ovarian Torsion\n- Sudden onset of severe, sharp, and usually unilateral lower abdominal pain, often radiating to the back and across the abdomen, is a hallmark symptom of ovarian torsion[1][3][5].\n- Nausea and vomiting are common, occurring in approximately 70% of cases, although your use of Zofran may mask these symptoms[1][3][5].\n- The pain can worsen over a few hours and may be accompanied by rebound pain and abdominal tenderness.\n\n## Diagnostic Challenges\n- Diagnosing ovarian torsion can be difficult and often requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Imaging tests such as transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound, and sometimes CT scans or MRI can help, but they do not always provide a definitive diagnosis[1][2][3].\n- Doppler ultrasound is particularly useful as it can show impaired blood flow to the ovary, which is a strong indicator of torsion[1][3][5].\n\n## Current Situation\n- Since the ER visit did not rule out ovarian torsion and you are experiencing worsening pain, it is essential to seek further evaluation.\n- The doctor you saw recently did not adequately address your concerns, but it is crucial to persist in seeking a proper diagnosis.\n\n## Immediate Steps\n- **Contact Your Surgeon:** Reach out to your excision specialist or surgeon as soon as possible to explain your symptoms and request their advice on how to proceed. Given your upcoming surgery, they may have specific insights or recommendations[1][3][5].\n- **Seek a Second Opinion:** If possible, visit another emergency room or a different healthcare provider who can evaluate you more thoroughly. Emphasize your concerns about ovarian torsion and the need for a definitive diagnosis.\n- **Insist on Imaging:** Request a more detailed ultrasound, specifically a transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler, to assess blood flow to the ovaries. This is the most reliable non-invasive method to support a diagnosis of ovarian torsion[1][2][3].\n\n## Managing Pain and Concerns\n- **Avoid Over-reliance on Narcotics:** While pain management is important, your concern about drug dependency is valid. Try to avoid additional narcotics if possible and focus on getting a proper diagnosis.\n- **Seizure Risk:** Given your epilepsy, it is crucial to manage your pain effectively to reduce any potential increase in seizure risk. However, this should be balanced with the need to avoid dependency on narcotics.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Pelvic Physiotherapist and Family Doctor:** Although they are unavailable until September, keep them informed of your situation so they can provide guidance or support when they become available.\n\nBy insisting on a thorough evaluation and seeking a second opinion, you can better determine whether your symptoms are due to ovarian torsion or another condition, and receive the appropriate treatment to alleviate your pain and address your underlying concerns."

I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started.

While I\u2019m glad my scans/tests were unremarkable, I wish I had gotten some sort of answer.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your medical history and the recent onset of seizures, there are several potential factors and interactions to consider:\n\n## Substance Interactions and Side Effects\n- Your use of Zoloft (sertraline) and marijuana could be contributing to your seizures. Combining these substances can lead to increased side effects, including altered serotonin levels, which can disrupt brain chemistry and potentially trigger seizures. Marijuana can suppress liver enzymes that metabolize Zoloft, leading to higher levels of the medication in your bloodstream, which may exacerbate side effects and reduce the medication's effectiveness[2][4][5>.\n\n## Medication Side Effects\n- While Keppra is generally safe, it is crucial to monitor its effects, especially when combined with other medications like Zoloft and Adderall. However, Keppra itself is not typically associated with inducing seizures but rather with controlling them.\n\n## Underlying Medical Conditions\n- Despite your CT, MRI, and EEG being unremarkable, other underlying conditions could still be contributing to your seizures. These include:\n  - **Central Nervous System (CNS) Infections**: Even if your recent tests were normal, CNS infections such as meningitis, encephalitis, or other infections could trigger seizures. It might be worth revisiting this possibility with your healthcare provider[1].\n  - **Brain Tumors or Injuries**: Although your scans were unremarkable, sometimes small lesions or injuries might not be immediately visible. Continued monitoring and possibly more detailed imaging or other diagnostic tests could be necessary[1][5].\n\n## Substance Use and Withdrawal\n- Your use of marijuana and vaping could be contributing factors. Substance use and withdrawal, especially from substances like alcohol or other drugs, can trigger seizures. Even though you mentioned you are a non-drinker, the impact of other substances should be considered[1][3].\n\n## Other Health Conditions\n- Your preexisting conditions, such as Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder, are managed with Zoloft, but the interaction between Zoloft and other substances, as well as the potential for underlying neurological conditions, should be evaluated further.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Given the random nature of your seizures and the lack of clear causes, it might be beneficial to:\n  - **Consult a Neurologist**: A specialist can provide more detailed evaluation and guidance on managing your seizures.\n  - **Drug Interaction Review**: Have your healthcare provider review all your medications and substance use to identify any potential interactions that could be contributing to your seizures.\n  - **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups and monitoring for any changes or new symptoms are crucial to managing your condition effectively.\n  - **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Avoiding substances like marijuana and ensuring consistent adherence to your prescribed medications could help stabilize your condition.\n\nIt is important to work closely with your healthcare team to identify the underlying cause of your seizures and to adjust your treatment plan accordingly."

        "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your father's medical history and current symptoms, here are some key points to consider:\n\n### Hepatic Encephalopathy and Xifaxan (Rifaximin)\n- Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication of advanced liver disease, characterized by cognitive disturbances ranging from mild confusion to coma. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is often used to prevent the recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy because it reduces the production of ammonia in the gut, which is a key factor in the development of this condition[3][5].\n\n### Seizures and Hepatic Encephalopathy\n- While seizures are not a common symptom of hepatic encephalopathy, they can occur in severe cases. The primary symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include alterations in mental status, such as confusion, disorientation, and changes in personality. However, in rare instances, seizures can be associated with the more severe forms of the condition or with other complications related to liver disease[3].\n\n### Impact of Stopping Xifaxan\n- Stopping Xifaxan could potentially lead to a recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy symptoms, including cognitive decline and possibly seizures, especially if the underlying condition is not well-controlled. Given your father's recent seizures and his decision to stop taking Xifaxan, it is plausible that the seizures could be related to the recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n### Other Potential Causes of Seizures\n- Other factors, such as the recent use of salt tablets for low salt levels or the history of a motorbike accident, could also be considered. However, the temporal association between stopping Xifaxan and the occurrence of seizures suggests that hepatic encephalopathy recurrence might be a significant contributing factor.\n\n### Management and Next Steps\n- It is crucial for your father to discuss his decision to stop Xifaxan with his healthcare provider, as the benefits of continuing this medication likely outweigh the discomfort of frequent bathroom visits.\n- The upcoming fMRI scan will help determine if there are any structural issues in the brain that could be causing the seizures.\n- Given the history of esophageal varices and advanced liver disease, it is also important to manage his cirrhosis and prevent further complications, such as variceal bleeding. Medications like Propranolol, which he is currently taking, help reduce portal pressure and the risk of bleeding from varices[1][3][5].\n\n### Patient Compliance and Lifestyle\n- As you've noted, it can be challenging to ensure patient compliance with medication, especially when there are significant lifestyle adjustments involved. Encouraging open communication with his healthcare providers about his concerns and exploring alternative solutions to manage the side effects of Xifaxan might be helpful.\n\nIn summary, the return of seizures after stopping Xifaxan could be related to the recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy. It is essential for your father to have a thorough discussion with his healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of continuing Xifaxan and other aspects of his care to manage both his liver disease and seizures effectively."

        "question": "19F 167cm 59kg chinese in UK // \"passing out\" under certain conditions, suspected focal epilepsy?? duration: 3+ years?? (no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing could be indicative of several conditions, but given the specific triggers and nature of the episodes, focal epilepsy is a possibility that should be considered. Here are some key points to help you understand and prepare for a medical evaluation:\n\n## Triggers and Symptoms\n- Your episodes are triggered by focusing on bright lights or screens in dimly lit environments, which is a specific and consistent pattern.\n- Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, eye roll, loss of focus, and brief periods of unconsciousness, followed by disorientation and potential repeat episodes[4|.\n- The delay between exposure to the stimulus and the onset of symptoms, as well as the repetitive nature of the episodes in the same environment, suggests a potentially seizure-related condition.\n\n## Characteristics of Focal Seizures\n- Focal seizures originate from one part of the brain and can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the affected area. They can be divided into two main types:\n  - **Focal aware seizures**: Where consciousness is preserved. However, your symptoms suggest a possible loss of awareness, which is more characteristic of focal impaired awareness seizures[2][4][5].\n  - **Focal impaired awareness seizures**: These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness and can include repetitive behaviors (automatisms), such as staring, lip smacking, or other involuntary movements. Your description of losing focus, feeling disoriented, and potentially \"passing out\" aligns with this type[2][4][5].\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\nTo determine if you have focal epilepsy, several diagnostic tests may be necessary:\n- **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To record the electrical activity in your brain and detect any abnormalities.\n- **MRI or CT scans**: To look for structural abnormalities in the brain.\n- **PET scans or SPECT**: To identify areas of the brain with abnormal metabolic activity.\n- **Blood tests**: To rule out metabolic or genetic disorders that could be contributing to the seizures.\n- **Video/EEG long-term monitoring**: To capture the seizures and correlate them with EEG findings[2][5].\n\n## Auras and Premonitory Sensations\n- Some people with focal seizures experience auras or premonitory sensations before the seizure, such as feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, or sensory changes. While you mentioned dizziness and nausea, these could be part of the seizure onset rather than distinct auras[2][5].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven your symptoms and the fact that you cannot see a GP until October, it is crucial to:\n- **Document your episodes**: Keep a detailed log of when the episodes occur, the specific triggers, and the duration of each episode. This will help your healthcare provider understand the pattern and nature of your symptoms.\n- **Seek Urgent Medical Attention if Necessary**: If you experience any severe or prolonged episodes, or if you have concerns about your safety, consider visiting an emergency department or urgent care center.\n- **Consult a Neurologist**: When you return, ensure you see a neurologist who can perform the necessary tests and provide a specialized diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIt is important to get a comprehensive evaluation to rule out other possible causes, such as neurological disorders, cardiovascular issues, or other medical conditions that might mimic the symptoms of focal seizures."

He looked lethargic and wouldn\u2019t respond to stimulation. Then shook a little bit 3 times and went back to normal. Was this a seizure? Should I take him to the hospital or have his doctor look into it at his physical?Thank you for any responseUpdate: baby went to the doctor today they will be doing an EEG to be on the safe side.",

        "answer": "The symptoms your son exhibited could be indicative of several possibilities, but given the nature of the episode, it is crucial to consider the possibility of a seizure.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n## Symptoms Observed\n- Your son woke up screaming and could not be consoled.\n- He appeared unresponsive with his eyes open and looked lethargic.\n- He did not respond to stimulation.\n- He shook a little bit three times before returning to normal.\n\n## Seizure Indicators\nThese symptoms align with some of the warning signs of seizures in children:\n- Unresponsive or lethargic state[1][5].\n- Sudden screaming or crying, which could be a manifestation of the seizure[1][5].\n- Brief periods of shaking or jerking movements, which are common in seizures, particularly in the context of focal or generalized seizures[1][5].\n\n## Types of Seizures\n- **Subtle Seizures**: These can include symptoms such as unresponsiveness, staring, and unusual movements like sucking, smacking, or bicycling, though these are more common in newborns[3].\n- **Focal Seizures**: These can cause a child to be unresponsive and exhibit unusual behaviors like gagging, lip smacking, or other automatisms. The shaking could be part of a focal seizure with altered awareness[1][5].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven that your son has already been to the doctor and an EEG has been scheduled, this is the appropriate course of action. An EEG will help determine if there was abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which is indicative of a seizure.\n\n### Immediate Action\nIf your son experiences another episode with similar symptoms, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. Seizures, especially if recurrent or severe, require prompt evaluation to rule out any underlying serious conditions.\n\n### Follow-Up\nAfter the EEG, your doctor will be able to provide more specific guidance based on the results. If the EEG indicates seizure activity, further testing or consultation with a neurologist may be necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment."

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

        "answer": "Given your history and current situation, here are some key points and recommendations to consider:\n\n## Seizure Recurrence Risk\nAfter stopping antiepileptic medication, the risk of seizure recurrence is significant. Studies indicate that approximately 26-63% of patients experience seizure recurrence after discontinuing their medication, with the highest risk within the first 6-12 months[1][3][5].\n\n## Your Specific Situation\n- You stopped taking oxcarbazepine after being seizure-free for many years, but experienced a recurrence of symptoms after an infection and antibiotic treatment.\n- The medication that previously worked no longer seems effective.\n- You have managed your condition partially through a keto diet and exercise, but still experience significant symptoms.\n\n## Considerations for Restarting or Changing Medication\n\n### Restarting Oxcarbazepine\nGiven that the oxcarbazepine no longer works effectively after the antibiotic treatment, restarting it may not be the best option.\n\n### Changing Medication\nIt might be beneficial to discuss with your neurologist the possibility of trying a different antiepileptic drug. Different medications have varying side effect profiles and efficacies, and some may be more suitable for your current situation. For example, medications like lamotrigine and levetiracetam are often considered for their favorable side effect profiles and lower risk of teratogenicity[1][3].\n\n### Tapering and Withdrawal\nIf you decide to switch medications, it is crucial to taper off the old medication gradually under medical supervision to avoid withdrawal seizures[3].\n\n## Lifestyle Management\nContinuing a keto diet and regular exercise can be beneficial in managing your symptoms, but given the severity of your current symptoms, this alone may not be sufficient.\n\n## Consultation with Your Neurologist\nIt is essential to have a thorough discussion with your neurologist to assess the following:\n- The reasons for the recurrence of symptoms and the failure of the previous medication.\n- The potential benefits and risks of switching to a new medication.\n- Other lifestyle modifications that could help manage your condition.\n- The feasibility of continuing with dietary management in conjunction with medication.\n\n## Quality of Life and Functionality\nGiven the significant impact on your daily life, including your ability to socialize, travel, or even consider a regular job, finding an effective treatment plan is critical. Your neurologist can help you weigh the pros and cons of different treatment options and develop a plan that minimizes side effects while maximizing control over your seizures[1][3].\n\nIn summary, you should:\n- Consult your neurologist about the possibility of switching to a different antiepileptic medication.\n- Continue to manage your condition through lifestyle modifications like a keto diet and exercise, but recognize that these may not be sufficient on their own.\n- Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of any new treatment plan, including the potential side effects and the impact on your quality of life."

        "question": "I took my epilepsy meds about 1.5h ago, Divalproex Sodium 250mg. I want to take a regular Gravol (not nighttime) so I can get to sleep earlier. I know it's not the best sleep aid but I don't have anything else at home currently and I want to fix my awful schedule.I read something about diphenhydramine triggering seizures but I'm not sure how similar it is to dimenhydrinate which is in Gravol so I'm a little worried as I haven't had one in years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering taking Gravol (which contains dimenhydrinate) while on Divalproex Sodium for epilepsy, here are some points to consider:\n\n## Similarity to Diphenhydramine\nDimenhydrinate, the active ingredient in Gravol, is an antihistamine similar to diphenhydramine (found in Benadryl). Both drugs have anticholinergic and sedative effects. However, the specific risks associated with diphenhydramine, such as triggering seizures, are less commonly reported with dimenhydrinate.\n\n## Risk of Seizures\nWhile diphenhydramine is known to cause seizures, especially in overdose situations[2][5], dimenhydrinate is generally considered to have a lower risk of this side effect. However, it is still important to exercise caution, especially since you have a history of epilepsy.\n\n## Interaction with Divalproex Sodium\nThere is no specific interaction listed between dimenhydrinate and divalproex sodium that would significantly increase the risk of seizures or other adverse effects. However, combining any central nervous system depressants (like antihistamines) with antiepileptic drugs can potentially enhance sedative effects and may affect your overall neurological status[1][4].\n\n## Precautions\n- If you must take dimenhydrinate, start with a low dose to assess your tolerance and reaction.\n- Be aware of the potential for increased sedation when combining dimenhydrinate with divalproex sodium.\n- Monitor your condition closely for any signs of adverse effects, including increased drowsiness, confusion, or any seizure activity.\n\nGiven your history of epilepsy and the current medication regimen, it is advisable to consult your healthcare provider before taking any new medication, even if it is over-the-counter, to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your specific situation."

        "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation, the rashes you've developed at the IV insertion sites could be due to several possible causes. Here are some considerations and potential steps you can take:\n\n## Injection Site Reactions\nThe symptoms you described, such as redness, elevation, and itchiness at the IV insertion sites, are common in injection site reactions. These reactions can occur due to the insertion of the IV line itself or the substances administered through it[4].\n\n## IV Line Infections\nIt is also possible that the rashes could be signs of an IV line infection, especially given that your IV was changed multiple times. Symptoms of IV line infections include redness, swelling, pain, and oozing fluid at the insertion site. If you notice any of these symptoms, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately[1].\n\n## Allergic Reactions\nWhile an allergic reaction to the IV materials or medications is less likely but still possible, the symptoms you described are more in line with an injection site reaction or a potential infection.\n\n## Home and Over-the-Counter Remedies\nBefore consulting your doctor, here are some steps you can take:\n\n### Observation\nMonitor the rashes closely for any signs of worsening, such as increased redness, swelling, or the presence of pus.\n\n### Hygiene\nEnsure the areas are kept clean to prevent infection.\n\n### Cold Compresses\nApply a cold compress to the affected areas to reduce discomfort and swelling[4].\n\n### Anti-Itch Creams\nYou can try over-the-counter anti-itch creams like hydrocortisone or calamine lotion to alleviate itchiness. However, avoid using antihistamine creams, benzocaine, neomycin, or bacitracin as they can further irritate the skin[5].\n\n### Antihistamines\nIf the itchiness is severe, you can take an oral antihistamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at night to help with sleep, but it won't necessarily reduce the itchiness itself[2][5].\n\n## Medical Consultation\nGiven your recent surgeries and the fact that you are on multiple medications, it is prudent to consult your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can evaluate the rashes and determine if they are due to an infection or another cause, and provide appropriate treatment, which may include antibiotics if an infection is suspected.\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of caution, especially when you have had recent surgeries and are on multiple medications. Contacting your healthcare provider will ensure you receive the necessary evaluation and treatment."

        "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "To differentiate between dementia syndromes and other conditions, especially in a case like your mother's, several key aspects need to be considered:\n\n## Comprehensive Medical and Psychiatric History\nA thorough medical and psychiatric history is crucial. This includes assessing for past medical conditions, surgeries, medications, and any substance use that could influence cognitive function. In your mother's case, her history of mild cognitive impairment since surgery, recent diagnosis of depressive disorder, and current psychiatric follow-up are important factors[1][4][5].\n\n## Clinical Presentation and Course\n- **Depression**: Depression can present with cognitive symptoms that mimic dementia, often referred to as \"pseudodementia.\" It is essential to evaluate mood and neurovegetative symptoms (such as sleep, energy, appetite, and motivation) to differentiate between depression and dementia. Patients with depression are more likely to report their cognitive complaints than those with dementia[4].\n- **Delirium**: This is characterized by an acute onset of cognitive and attention deficits, often with fluctuating levels of consciousness. Delirium is usually reversible if the underlying cause is addressed promptly[5].\n- **Dementia**: Dementia involves a chronic decline in cognitive function with involvement of multiple cognitive domains and significant interference with daily life. Patients with dementia may not be aware of their cognitive deficits, unlike those with depression who often report their concerns[1][4].\n\n## Cognitive and Functional Assessments\n- **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Test**: These are screening tools that help assess cognitive function.\n  - The **MMSE** is a widely used test that evaluates several cognitive functions including arithmetic, memory, and orientation. While it can provide a quick snapshot of cognitive status, it is not definitive for diagnosing dementia and has limitations, such as being influenced by education level and cultural background[2].\n  - The **Clock Test** assesses executive function and is often used in conjunction with the MMSE. It involves asking the patient to draw a clock face with specific times marked. This test can help identify visuospatial and executive function deficits[5].\n\n## Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)\nEvaluating ADLs is crucial to understand the impact of cognitive symptoms on daily functioning. Tools like the Functional Activities Questionnaire can help assess how well the patient manages daily tasks such as managing medications, finances, and transportation[2].\n\n## Role of Informants\nGathering information from family members or informants who know the patient well can provide valuable insights into the patient's cognitive and functional changes over time. This is particularly important in differentiating between dementia and other conditions[2][4].\n\n## Laboratory and Imaging Studies\nWhile not directly mentioned in your query, these studies are essential in ruling out other causes of cognitive impairment, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or structural brain abnormalities. They can also help in identifying specific types of dementia[5].\n\n### Specific Observations in Your Mother's Case\n\n- **Difficulty in Transmitting Information and Sense of Overwhelm**: These symptoms could be indicative of executive function deficits, which are common in various forms of dementia, including vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia. However, they could also be related to depression or other psychiatric conditions.\n- **Independence in Daily Activities**: The fact that your mother remains independent in her domestic daily activities suggests that her cognitive impairment may not be as advanced. However, it is important to monitor changes in her ability to perform these tasks over time[2].\n\n### Differential Diagnosis Steps\n\n1. **Rule Out Reversible Causes**: Ensure that there are no underlying medical conditions (e.g., vitamin deficiencies, metabolic disorders, infections) or medication side effects contributing to her cognitive symptoms.\n2. **Assess for Depression**: Given her history of depressive disorder, it is crucial to continue monitoring her depressive symptoms and ensuring they are adequately managed.\n3. **Evaluate Cognitive Domains**: A comprehensive cognitive assessment should be conducted to identify which cognitive domains are affected. This can help differentiate between types of dementia or other cognitive disorders.\n4. **Use Screening Tools**: Tools like the MMSE and Clock Test, along with more detailed neuropsychological tests, can provide a more thorough understanding of her cognitive status.\n5. **Monitor Progression**: Regular follow-up to assess changes in her cognitive function and ability to perform daily activities is essential for diagnosing and managing her condition.\n\nIn summary, while the MMSE and Clock Test are useful screening tools, a definitive diagnosis of dementia or other cognitive disorders requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation, careful history-taking, and often additional laboratory and imaging studies. Given the complexity of your mother's case, a multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatry, neurology, and possibly neuropsychology would be beneficial."

        "question": "Hi I recently had blood work done (a week ago) and my levels were high. 36yr female, I take 300mg daily of lamictal for epilepsy.Hemoglobin: 16.4 H Red blood cell count: 5.22 H Hematocrit: 47.8 H Some things I've noticed in the last 2-3 months, not sure if they are symptoms, but they have been happening enough and are different enough that I've noticed them. - night sweats, sometimes the shirt I sleep in will be wet, and it wakes me up - itchiness after hot baths or showers - fatigue (I had low vitamin D, so not sure if it's necessarily related to red blood cell count, vitamin D, or just general tiredness, i haven't been sleeping well for the past few months)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your recent blood work results and the symptoms you've described, here are some potential explanations and considerations:\n\n## High Red Blood Cell Count\n- A high red blood cell count, as indicated by your elevated hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and hematocrit, can be caused by several factors. Common causes include:\n  - Dehydration, which can concentrate your blood and falsely elevate red blood cell counts[1][4].\n  - Living at high altitudes or conditions that reduce oxygen in the blood, such as heart disease, kidney disease, or respiratory diseases[1][4].\n  - Smoking, though you didn't mention smoking, it's a common lifestyle factor[1][4].\n  - Genetic conditions like polycythemia vera, though this is less common[1][4].\n\n## Symptoms\n\n### Night Sweats\n- Night sweats can be caused by various factors, including hormonal changes, infections, diabetes, or certain medications. Given your age and gender, hormonal fluctuations could be a consideration, especially if you are experiencing other symptoms related to menopause or premenopause, although this is less likely at 36. Night sweats can also be associated with other medical conditions or as a side effect of medications[5].\n\n### Itchiness After Hot Baths or Showers\n- Itchiness (pruritus) can have multiple causes, including skin conditions, allergies, or even underlying medical conditions like lymphoma, though the latter is less common. Itchiness after hot baths or showers could be related to dry skin or other dermatological issues, but it is also worth considering other potential underlying causes[2].\n\n### Fatigue\n- Fatigue is a nonspecific symptom that can be caused by many factors, including low vitamin D levels, which you mentioned. It can also be related to your high red blood cell count, though this is less directly linked. Poor sleep quality and other lifestyle factors can also contribute to fatigue[2].\n\n## Medication Consideration\n- You are taking lamotrigine (Lamictal) for epilepsy. While lamotrigine is not typically associated with increasing red blood cell counts, it can affect blood cell levels by lowering white blood cells and platelets. However, it does not typically cause an increase in red blood cells[3].\n\n## Next Steps\n- Given the combination of your symptoms and the high red blood cell count, it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n- Dehydration should be ruled out; ensuring adequate hydration might normalize your blood cell counts.\n- Your healthcare provider may order additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the high red blood cell count, such as checking erythropoietin levels or evaluating for underlying medical conditions.\n- Addressing your night sweats, itchiness, and fatigue will require a comprehensive approach, potentially including lifestyle changes, further testing, and possibly adjusting your medication regimen if deemed necessary.\n\nA thorough medical evaluation will help distinguish between these various potential causes and guide the appropriate treatment."

        "answer": "Given the complex and multifaceted nature of your symptoms, it is clear that you are experiencing a combination of neurological and other health issues. Here are some key points and potential considerations based on the information provided:\n\n## Existing Diagnoses\n- **Epilepsy**: Diagnosed in 2007. Your recent EEG and episodes suggest that your seizure activity may not be fully controlled or that there are other contributing factors.\n- **Narcolepsy with Cataplexy**: Diagnosed in 2009. This condition can explain some of the sudden muscle weakness and sleep disturbances.\n- **Raynaud's with Erythermalgia**: Diagnosed in 2016. This condition involves blood vessel issues and can cause symptoms like numbness and stiffness.\n\n## Additional Symptoms\n- **Pins and Needles**: Experiencing pins and needles in various parts of your body could be related to neurological conditions, including neuropathies or other nerve disorders. It could also be a symptom of your existing epilepsy or narcolepsy[1][3][4].\n- **Muscle Spasms and Vibrating Sensation**: These symptoms could be linked to neurological issues, muscle disorders, or even side effects of medications.\n- **Urge Incontinence**: This might be related to neurological control issues, especially considering your history of constipation and other neurological conditions.\n- **Nasal Drip**: While your primary doctor attributes this to postnasal drip, it's worth noting if this symptom is part of a broader neurological or autoimmune picture.\n\n## Recent Episodes\n- **Confusion, Rapid Heartbeat, Shakiness**: These episodes, especially when you feel confused, scared, and rushed, could be related to seizure activity, narcoleptic episodes, or other neurological disturbances. The fact that you can hear everything but can't talk and have muscle heaviness suggests a complex neurologic event.\n- **Brain Fog**: Improved with Nuvigil, which suggests that your brain fog might be related to your narcolepsy.\n\n## New Medication\n- **Vimpat**: This medication is often used for epilepsy and may help in managing your seizure activity. However, it's crucial to monitor its effectiveness and any potential side effects.\n\n## Diagnostic Considerations\n- **Other Neurological Conditions**: Given the breadth of your symptoms, it might be helpful to rule out other neurological conditions such as:\n  - **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)**: Some of your symptoms, like the \"drooping\" or pulling sensation in your lip, muscle heaviness, and inability to use muscles, could be consistent with FND. FND is diagnosed based on clinical features rather than the absence of other conditions[3].\n  - **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: MS can present with a wide range of symptoms including numbness, weakness, vision problems, and balance issues. While some of your symptoms overlap, a comprehensive evaluation would be necessary to rule this out[2][4].\n  - **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome or ADEM**: These rare conditions could be considered, especially given the sudden onset of some symptoms and the involvement of multiple body systems. However, these conditions typically have a more acute presentation[2].\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation**: Given the complexity of your symptoms, a thorough evaluation by a neurologist, including additional testing such as MRI, MRA, or other specialized tests, might be necessary to fully understand the underlying causes of your symptoms[1][4].\n- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Involving a team of healthcare professionals, including neurologists, physical therapists, and other specialists, can help manage the various aspects of your condition effectively[5].\n\nIt is essential to maintain close communication with your neurologist and other healthcare providers to ensure that all your symptoms are being adequately addressed and to adjust your treatment plan as necessary."

        "question": "An MRI with Neuroquant showed these normative percentiles: Hippocampal Occupancy Score \u2013 32 Hippocampi \u2013 72 Superior Lateral Ventricles \u2013 94 Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74 The hippocampal volume seems normal but the hippocampal occupancy score is very low. What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward. My information: 24F, 110 pounds, conditions: epilepsy, history of COVID, history of vaccine reaction, medications: Trileptal, location of problem: brain, duration: 9 months",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The results from your NeuroQuant analysis, particularly the Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOC) and the volumes of other brain structures, provide valuable insights into your brain health and potential risks.\n\n## Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOC)\n- A HOC of 32 is significantly low. The HOC measures the degree of hippocampal atrophy, taking into account both the volume of the hippocampus and the compensatory expansion of the inferior lateral ventricles. A lower HOC indicates more severe hippocampal atrophy, which is highly associated with an increased risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD)[4].\n\n## Hippocampal Volume\n- Despite your hippocampal volume being within normal percentiles (72), the low HOC suggests that there is significant atrophy relative to the expansion of the inferior lateral ventricles. This indicates that while the absolute volume might be normal, the context of ventricular expansion suggests underlying neurodegeneration[4].\n\n## Ventricular Volumes\n- Superior Lateral Ventricles at 94 percentile and Inferior Lateral Ventricles at 74 percentile indicate enlargement, which is often a marker of brain atrophy. Enlarged ventricles can be associated with various neurodegenerative processes[1][4].\n\n## Clinical Implications\nGiven your symptoms and the NeuroQuant results:\n- **Memory Loss and Cognitive Symptoms**: The low HOC and ventricular enlargement suggest significant neurodegenerative changes that could be contributing to your memory loss and other cognitive symptoms.\n- **Depersonalization and Reduced Consciousness**: These symptoms could be related to the neurodegenerative changes, especially given the involvement of the hippocampus and temporal lobe, which are crucial for memory and cognitive functions.\n- **Past Medical History**: Your history of epilepsy, COVID-19, vaccine reaction, and previous use of CBD oil could all be contributing factors. However, the specific impact of these factors on your current brain health needs further investigation.\n- **Prognosis**: The low HOC and ventricular enlargement are concerning signs that suggest an increased risk of further cognitive decline. It is essential to monitor these changes over time and consider additional evaluations and potential interventions to halt or slow the progression of neurodegeneration.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Follow-Up MRI and NeuroQuant Analysis**: Regular follow-ups to track changes in brain volumes and HOC can help in understanding the progression of the condition.\n- **Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation by a neurologist or a specialist in dementia and cognitive disorders to assess the impact of your past medical history and current symptoms.\n- **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Ensuring that your epilepsy is well-managed, and addressing any potential side effects or interactions from your medications.\n- **Cognitive and Behavioral Support**: Considering cognitive therapy, behavioral interventions, and support to manage your symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\nGiven the complexity of your case, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can integrate all the available information to provide a comprehensive diagnosis and management plan."

Has anyone heard of any data related to the Covid vaccine and GBS and/or is there a better choice when choosing between brands.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "There is significant data and discussion regarding the risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) associated with COVID-19 vaccines, which can help guide your decision.\n\n## Risk of GBS After COVID-19 Infection vs. Vaccination\n- A study from Israel published in *Neurology* found that the risk of GBS is approximately 6 times higher after a COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. In contrast, receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a decreased risk of GBS, with an odds ratio of 0.41[1].\n\n## Specific COVID-19 Vaccines and GBS Risk\n- The main concern regarding GBS and COVID-19 vaccines is primarily associated with the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Studies and reports from the CDC, VAERS, and other sources indicate an increased risk of GBS after the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, particularly among men aged 50 and older[3][4][5].\n- There is no significant evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These mRNA vaccines have not been linked to a higher incidence of GBS compared to the general population[3][4].\n\n## Comparative Risks\n- The risk of GBS following the J&J vaccine, while increased, is still relatively rare. For example, the FDA noted that out of the reports received, most cases required hospitalization, but the overall number of cases remains low[4].\n- In contrast, the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not widely used in the U.S., has also shown some association with GBS, particularly after the first dose, but this risk is not higher than the risk of GBS following COVID-19 infection itself[2].\n\n## Recommendations\nGiven your history of epilepsy and concerns about GBS, opting for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine would be a safer choice based on current evidence. These mRNA vaccines have not been associated with an increased risk of GBS, unlike the J&J vaccine.\n\nIt's important to consult with your healthcare provider to make an informed decision that considers your specific medical history and current health status."

Neurology only wants to repeat an mri once per year to rule out ms",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the ongoing diagnostic challenges, here are some points to consider and potential directions for further investigation:\n\n## Heat Intolerance and Rhabdomyolysis\nYour symptoms of extreme heat intolerance and recurring rhabdomyolysis (as indicated by high creatine kinase (CK) levels) suggest a condition that affects your body's ability to regulate temperature and manage muscle stress.\n\n- **Heat Intolerance**: This can be a symptom of various underlying conditions, including dysautonomia, which affects the autonomic nervous system. Conditions such as diabetes, obesity, infections, skin disorders, and certain neurological diseases (like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) can cause heat intolerance[5].\n\n## Musculoskeletal and Neurological Symptoms\n- **Muscle Spasms/Cramps and Rhabdomyolysis**: These symptoms can be associated with conditions that affect muscle metabolism or the nervous system. Rhabdomyolysis can occur due to intense physical exertion, especially in hot environments, but recurring episodes suggest an underlying issue. Conditions such as mitochondrial myopathies or other metabolic myopathies could be considered, given the symptoms of muscle fatigue, spasms, and rhabdomyolysis[5].\n\n## Burning Sensations and Numbness\n- **Neurological Involvement**: The progression from numbness to a burning sensation in your arms and legs could indicate a neurological condition. While neurology has ruled out epilepsy and PNES, and is monitoring for MS, other conditions like peripheral neuropathy or a metabolic disorder affecting the nervous system should be considered.\n\n## Low Testosterone and Endocrinological Factors\n- **Endocrine System**: Low testosterone, for which you are on replacement therapy, could be a contributing factor but may not be the sole cause of your symptoms. Other endocrine disorders, such as thyroid conditions (e.g., Graves\u2019 disease), can also cause heat intolerance and muscle symptoms[5].\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Comprehensive Metabolic Evaluation**: Given the recurring rhabdomyolysis and heat intolerance, a comprehensive metabolic evaluation, including genetic testing for mitochondrial or other metabolic myopathies, might be necessary.\n- **Neurological Reevaluation**: While an annual MRI to rule out MS is part of the monitoring, more frequent assessments or additional tests (like EMG, nerve conduction studies, or spinal fluid analysis) might help identify other neurological conditions.\n- **Environmental and Lifestyle Adjustments**: To manage heat intolerance, avoid strenuous activities in hot environments, wear lightweight clothing, stay hydrated, and use cooling measures. These can help reduce the frequency and severity of rhabdomyolysis episodes[3][5].\n- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Considering your complex symptoms, a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, endocrinology, and possibly rheumatology or a specialist in metabolic disorders could be beneficial.\n\n## Urgent Considerations\n- **Immediate Medical Attention**: Given the life-threatening potential of rhabdomyolysis, especially with CK levels at 16,000, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe symptoms or if your CK levels spike again. Aggressive fluid replacement and cooling measures are essential in such cases[1][3].\n\nBy pursuing a more comprehensive and multidisciplinary evaluation, you may be able to identify the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an effective management plan."

        "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your experience and the symptoms you described, it is important to consider the following points to understand your diagnosis and the likelihood that you are indeed suffering from epilepsy:\n\n## Phases of Seizures\nYour description of the events during and after your seizures aligns with the typical phases of seizures:\n- **Ictal Phase**: This is the active seizure period. Symptoms you mentioned, such as falling suddenly, seizing, and losing consciousness, are consistent with this phase[1][5].\n- **Post-ictal Phase**: After the seizure, you experienced confusion, disorientation, and a gradual regain of consciousness, which are common post-ictal symptoms[1][5].\n\n## Diagnostic Process\nThe diagnosis of epilepsy typically involves several tests to confirm abnormal electrical activity in the brain:\n- **EEG (Electroencephalogram)**: This is a common diagnostic tool that monitors brain waves to detect abnormal electrical activity indicative of seizures. If your EEG showed abnormal brain wave patterns, it supports the diagnosis of epilepsy[2][5].\n- **Clinical Evaluation**: Your medical history, the nature of your seizures, and any witnessed accounts (like the waiter's description) are also crucial in diagnosing epilepsy.\n\n## Medication and Side Effects\nYou have been prescribed Lamictal (lamotrigine), a common antiepileptic medication. The side effects you are experiencing, such as memory decline and frustration, are not uncommon with anti-epilepsy medications. These side effects often manifest in the initial stages of treatment and can sometimes be managed by adjusting the dosage or switching medications[3].\n\n## Doubts About Diagnosis\nWhile it is understandable to have doubts, especially with the suggestion of a vasovagal episode, several factors suggest that your diagnosis of epilepsy is likely correct:\n- **Frequency and Nature of Seizures**: You have had multiple seizures with significant loss of consciousness and post-ictal confusion, which is less typical for vasovagal episodes.\n- **Witnessed Accounts**: The waiter's description of your seizure and the paramedics' involvement suggest a more severe event than a typical vasovagal episode.\n- **Medical Diagnosis and Treatment**: Your healthcare providers have conducted diagnostics and prescribed medication based on their evaluation.\n\n## Next Steps\nTo address your concerns and ensure the accuracy of your diagnosis:\n- **Follow-Up with Your Healthcare Provider**: Discuss your side effects and any doubts you have about the diagnosis with your doctor. They can review your EEG results and other diagnostic data to confirm the diagnosis.\n- **Consider Additional Tests**: If there is any uncertainty, additional tests such as an MRI or further EEG monitoring may be recommended to rule out other conditions.\n\nIt is important to communicate openly with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and concerns to ensure you receive the best possible care."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "If your laryngeal candidiasis is not responding to fluconazole and the next step is treatment with amphotericin B, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Side Effects\nAmphotericin B is known for causing significant side effects, some of which can be severe. Common infusion-related reactions include:\n- Fever (51%)\n- Chills (28%)\n- Nausea (18%)\n- Headache (9%)\n- Thrombophlebitis (5%)[2][4].\n\n### Nephrotoxicity\nOne of the more serious side effects is nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients receiving higher doses. Around half of patients on 10-15 mg/kg/day of the liposomal formulation (AmBisome) can experience a significant increase in serum creatinine levels[2][4].\n\n### Other Reactions\nLiposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) can cause symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxia, flank pain, abdominal pain, and leg pain, especially during the first few minutes of the infusion. These symptoms can often be relieved by interrupting the infusion and administering diphenhydramine[2].\n\n## Management of Side Effects\nTo minimize these side effects:\n- A 1 mg test dose is often administered before the full dose.\n- The infusion rate can be slowed down (2-6 hours for the deoxycholate formulation).\n- Monitoring the infusion site for signs of phlebitis is crucial.\n- Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels may help protect against nephrotoxicity.\n- Pretreatment with medications like acetaminophen or corticosteroids may be considered, although the evidence is mixed[2].\n\n## Administration\nAmphotericin B is typically administered intravenously, either in a hospital setting or at home if you are trained to do so. Your healthcare provider will instruct you on how to infuse the medication and what to do if you encounter any problems[4].\n\n## Special Considerations\nGiven your background of asthma, epilepsy, and hypothyroidism:\n- Inform your doctor about all your medications, including Breo and prednisone, as well as any other health conditions.\n- Be aware that amphotericin B can interact with other medications, such as cyclosporine, digoxin, and oral steroids, which may require dose adjustments or close monitoring[4].\n\n## Alternative Options\nWhile amphotericin B is a powerful antifungal, it is usually reserved for severe or life-threatening infections due to its side effect profile. If possible, your doctor may consider other antifungals like itraconazole or voriconazole, especially if the Candida strain is resistant to fluconazole[1].\n\n### Monitoring and Follow-Up\nIt is essential to monitor your symptoms and side effects closely. If your symptoms do not improve or worsen while receiving amphotericin B, inform your doctor immediately. Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is crucial to adjust the treatment plan as needed[4].\n\nGiven the potential severity of side effects and the need for close monitoring, it is important to discuss all concerns and questions with your healthcare provider before starting treatment with amphotericin B."

        "question": "For a bit longer than a year, I've got random cramps in my sleep, I don't have any memories from that event afterwards and I also don't know what happens while it happens (seemingly like still being asleep). The only person that has observed the seizures/attacks is my girlfriend.Also I only get those cramps/seizures/attacks at night in my sleep and I know that I don't have photosensitive epilepsy.She furthermore described the attacks and mentioned that I seem to have trouble breathing and I seem to make weird noises.I was at a neurologist and he prescribed me Antelepsin at first and then Levetiracetam (up to now), which are both a medical substance that I have to take before going to bed. It does help, but it doesn't cure my state.I'm smoking tobacco on a daily basis, drink alcohol sometimes, smoking cannabis on weekends, and very rarely I take LSD in moderate dosages.As of yet I didn't get a real Diagnose, so I wanted to ask the reddit community, because why not giving it a shot right?I really hope someone can help me, mostly because I don't want to cause any more trouble and anxiety to my girlfriend.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the symptoms and context you described, it is highly likely that you are experiencing **nocturnal seizures**, which are a type of seizure that occurs during sleep. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Symptoms\n- The random cramps, trouble breathing, and making weird noises during sleep are consistent with nocturnal seizures. Common symptoms include involuntary movements (jerking, twitching, or stiffening of the limbs), making unusual noises, bedwetting, and difficulty breathing[3][5].\n- The lack of memory of the events and confusion upon waking are also typical[3][5].\n\n## Diagnosis\n- Nocturnal seizures are often associated with epilepsy, particularly forms like frontal lobe epilepsy or sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE)[1][3].\n- Diagnosis typically involves an electroencephalogram (EEG), polysomnography (a comprehensive sleep study), and sometimes video EEG monitoring to capture the seizures during sleep[1][5].\n\n## Observations by Your Girlfriend\n- Her observations of your nighttime behavior, such as trouble breathing and making weird noises, are crucial for diagnosing nocturnal seizures. It is common for individuals with nocturnal seizures to be unaware of their seizures, and observations from others can be very helpful[3].\n\n## Current Treatment\n- The medications you are taking, Antelepsin and Levetiracetam, are anticonvulsants commonly used to manage seizures. While they help control the seizures, they do not provide a cure[5].\n\n## Lifestyle Factors\n- Your use of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, as well as occasional use of LSD, could potentially influence your seizure frequency or severity. However, these factors alone do not explain the seizures, and an underlying neurological condition is likely the primary cause.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Given that you have not received a definitive diagnosis yet, it would be important to follow up with your neurologist for further evaluation.\n- Additional tests such as an MRI or CT scan might be recommended to rule out any structural brain abnormalities or other causes.\n- Continuing to monitor your seizures with the help of your girlfriend and possibly using a sleep diary or video monitoring can provide more data for your neurologist.\n\n## Importance of Medical Follow-Up\n- Nocturnal seizures can be potentially dangerous and increase the risk of injuries and other complications. It is crucial to work closely with your neurologist to refine your diagnosis and treatment plan[3].\n\nSeeking a comprehensive evaluation and continuing to work with your neurologist will be essential in managing your condition effectively and reducing the anxiety and trouble it causes for both you and your girlfriend."

        "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the symptoms and history your boyfriend has described, it is likely that he is experiencing **psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)** rather than epileptic seizures. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Differences from Epileptic Seizures\n- Despite the loss of consciousness and physical movements like kicking, trembling, and shaking, the triggers and context suggest these are not epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are typically characterized by a sudden discharge of electrical activity in the brain, often unrelated to external emotional triggers[1][4].\n- The fact that his attacks are primarily triggered by specific anxieties, such as a fear of needles and medical procedures, points more towards a psychological origin rather than a neurological one.\n\n## Similarities to Panic Attacks\n- The symptoms your boyfriend describes, such as intense fear, loss of consciousness, and physical manifestations like trembling and shaking, can resemble both panic attacks and seizures. However, the triggers and the absence of any neurological findings suggest a connection to his anxiety and panic disorder[1][2][4].\n\n## Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES)\n- PNES are episodes that resemble epileptic seizures but are not caused by electrical discharges in the brain. They are often linked to psychological stress, trauma, or anxiety disorders. The fact that his attacks only happen in anxious situations and that he has been tested for epilepsy with no positive findings supports this diagnosis[1][4].\n\n## Medical and Psychological Evaluation\n- Despite multiple tests ruling out epilepsy, it is crucial to continue monitoring and evaluating his condition. The purple face coloration during the attack could be due to hyperventilation or intense physical exertion, which can occur during severe anxiety or panic attacks[2][4].\n\n## Treatment and Therapy\n- Since your boyfriend has already been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, continuing therapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is important. However, given that confrontation therapy was not fully explored (aside from the needle procedure), a more comprehensive approach to addressing his specific fears and anxieties might be beneficial. Medications for anxiety and depression can also help manage his symptoms[2][4].\n\n## Immediate Response\n- In the event of another attack, ensuring his safety is paramount. Since you have already taken the step of calling an ambulance and he received medical attention, continuing to seek medical advice and adhering to any prescribed treatments will be crucial.\n\nGiven the complexity of his condition, it is important to work closely with healthcare professionals to tailor a treatment plan that addresses both his psychological and physical symptoms."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing, known as \"brain zaps,\" are often associated with several factors, but given your medical history and current medications, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Association with Medication\nBrain zaps are commonly experienced by individuals who are adjusting their dosage or stopping certain psychiatric medications, particularly antidepressants like SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and SNRIs (Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)[1][3][4].\nHowever, you are taking Strattera (atomoxetine), which is primarily used for ADHD and is not typically associated with brain zaps in the same way as antidepressants. Despite this, irregularity in taking your medication could potentially lead to some withdrawal-like symptoms, although brain zaps are not a commonly reported side effect of Strattera.\n\n## Neurological Disorders\nGiven your history of neurological disorders such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and past tic disorder, along with occasional mild non-epileptic seizures, it is possible that your brain zaps could be related to an underlying neurological condition. However, brain zaps themselves are not typically a symptom of these specific disorders.\n\n## Other Possible Causes\n- **Rapid Eye Movement**: Some research suggests that rapid lateral eye movements can trigger brain zaps, especially in individuals already at risk due to medication changes or other factors[1][4].\n- **General Stress and Anxiety**: Brain zaps can also be associated with high levels of stress or anxiety, which might be exacerbated by your other conditions[3].\n\n## Medical Evaluation\nSince your primary doctor has suggested an MRI and given your complex medical history, it is prudent to follow up with this recommendation. An MRI can help rule out any structural issues in the brain that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n## Consultation with a Specialist\nGiven the unusual nature of your symptoms and your extensive neurological history, consulting a neurologist or a psychiatrist might provide more insight. They can help determine if the brain zaps are related to your medication, an underlying neurological condition, or another factor entirely.\n\nIn summary, while brain zaps are generally not dangerous and often resolve on their own, the combination of your symptoms and medical history warrants a thorough evaluation to rule out any underlying issues that might require specific treatment."

I have ADHD, Panic attacks and Anxiety Disorder problems and even normal MRI is killing me inside why am i having those jerks!?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the normal MRI report, there are several considerations to keep in mind when distinguishing between myoclonic epilepsy and other conditions:\n\n## Myoclonic Epilepsy\n- Myoclonic epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), can present with myoclonic jerks even when the MRI is normal. JME is a form of generalized epilepsy, and patients often have normal MRI findings[4][5].\n- The diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy is typically confirmed through an electroencephalogram (EEG) or video-EEG, which can show generalized spike-wave discharges characteristic of this condition[4][5].\n\n## Diagnostic Steps\n- An EEG or video-EEG is crucial to determine if the jerks are epileptic in nature. This test can help differentiate between myoclonic seizures and other types of myoclonus[4][5].\n- Even if the MRI is normal, EEG findings can provide significant diagnostic information.\n\n## Other Considerations\n- **Motor Tics**: If the medication for motor tics is not effective, it does not rule out other conditions, including myoclonic epilepsy. Motor tics and myoclonic jerks can have different underlying causes and require different diagnostic approaches.\n- **Underlying Conditions**: Your existing conditions such as ADHD, anxiety disorder, and panic attacks do not typically cause myoclonic jerks directly, but they can be part of a broader clinical picture that needs to be considered.\n\n## Radiomics and Imaging\n- While your MRI is normal, advanced imaging techniques like radiomics can sometimes identify subtle changes in brain structure that are not visible on standard imaging. However, these are more research-oriented and not commonly used in routine clinical practice[1].\n\n## Next Steps\n- Discuss with your doctor the need for an EEG or video-EEG to assess the nature of your jerks.\n- If the EEG indicates generalized spike-wave discharges or other epileptic patterns, it would support a diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy.\n- Further neurophysiological testing, such as simultaneous EEG-EMG, may also be helpful in categorizing the type of myoclonus[4].\n\nIn summary, a normal MRI does not rule out myoclonic epilepsy, and further diagnostic testing, particularly EEG or video-EEG, is necessary to accurately diagnose the cause of your body jerks."

That was all I had for at least 24 hours in either direction.I don't think I feel any symptoms different than what I usually feel. I read that toxicity can cause confusion and ringing in the ears. But I always seem to have ringing in the ears from time to time, and I have epilepsy so I'm always a little tired and confused (I take carbamazapine 300mg 2x).How concerned should I be? 28 year old white male. About 160lbs and 5'6",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation, there are several factors to consider to assess the level of concern:\n\n### Overdose Symptoms\nTaking a large swallow of Pepto-Bismol Max, potentially up to the maximum daily dosage of 120mL, could lead to salicylate toxicity due to the bismuth subsalicylate content. Symptoms of salicylate toxicity include vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, confusion, excessive drowsiness, rapid breathing, and ringing in the ears (tinnitus)[1][4].\n\n### Your Current Health Status\n- You mentioned having epilepsy and taking carbamazepine, which can cause fatigue and confusion. However, if these symptoms worsen or if you experience new symptoms such as severe drowsiness, rapid breathing, or increased tinnitus, it could indicate salicylate toxicity.\n- The ringing in your ears, while common for you, should be monitored for any increase in intensity or duration.\n\n### Immediate Actions\n- Since you have taken a potentially large dose, it is prudent to monitor your symptoms closely.\n- If you experience any worsening of your usual symptoms or any new symptoms such as severe drowsiness, confusion, vomiting, abdominal pain, or other signs mentioned, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n### Contacting Poison Control\n- Given the uncertainty of the exact dosage you consumed, it would be wise to contact Poison Control for guidance. You can reach them at 1-800-222-1222 or use the webPOISONCONTROL tool for advice on what to do next[1][3].\n\n### Long-term Use and Bismuth Toxicity\n- Although your consumption was a one-time large dose, it's worth noting that long-term use of bismuth subsalicylate can lead to bismuth toxicity, characterized by neurological symptoms such as delirium, psychosis, ataxia, myoclonus, and seizures. However, this is more relevant to chronic rather than acute use[2][5].\n\nIn summary, while you may not be experiencing severe symptoms immediately, it is important to monitor your condition closely and seek medical advice or contact Poison Control to ensure you are not at risk for salicylate toxicity. If your symptoms worsen or if you experience any unusual or severe side effects, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical help."

Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",

        "answer": "The symptoms your girlfriend is experiencing are alarming and require meticulous medical investigation. Here are some points and potential directions to consider:\n\n## Fainting and Syncope\nFainting (syncope) after vaccination, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine, can be associated with a vasovagal reaction (VVR) or an overactive vagal response. This is often triggered by pain, anxiety, or the vaccination process itself, rather than the vaccine components[2][3].\n\n## Vasovagal Reaction (VVR)\nThe cases described in the medical literature involve VVR leading to presyncope or syncope, which can occur shortly after vaccination. Symptoms include dizziness, light-headedness, dimming of vision, cold sweating, and hypotension. These reactions are usually not serious but can be recurrent and disruptive[3].\n\n## Recurrent and Severe Symptoms\nGiven the frequency, duration, and severity of your girlfriend's episodes, it is crucial to rule out other underlying conditions. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n### Neurological Conditions\nDespite multiple hospital visits and examinations, it might be beneficial to have more specialized neurological evaluations. Conditions such as epilepsy, though ruled out, or other neurologic disorders could be considered. The symptoms of worsening vision, headache, and decreased sensation on one side of the body before attacks suggest a neurological component.\n\n### Autonomic Dysfunction\nThe symptoms of dizziness, hyperventilation, and convulsions could indicate autonomic dysfunction, which affects the autonomic nervous system that regulates involuntary actions of the body. This is consistent with the vasovagal reaction but could also be part of a broader autonomic disorder[3].\n\n### Cardiac Issues\nAlthough cardiac examinations have been conducted, it might be worth revisiting this aspect, especially given the symptoms of a fast-beating or pounding heart and fainting. Myocarditis and pericarditis, although rare, are known side effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and other cardiac conditions could also be a factor[1].\n\n## Medical Consultation\nGiven the complexity and severity of the symptoms, consulting a specialist in the following areas might be beneficial:\n\n- **Neurology**: For a detailed evaluation of potential neurological causes.\n- **Cardiology**: To rule out any cardiac issues.\n- **Autonomic Nervous System Specialist**: To evaluate for autonomic dysfunction.\n- **Internal Medicine or General Medicine**: For a comprehensive review of her overall health and potential interactions between different conditions.\n\n## Observation During an Episode\nAs you mentioned, observing your girlfriend during an episode could provide critical information. Medical professionals might need to witness an episode to accurately diagnose the condition.\n\n## Medication and Treatment\nGiven her adverse reactions to medications, it is crucial to work closely with healthcare providers to find alternative treatments that do not exacerbate her condition.\n\n## Psychological Support\nWhile you have clarified that she does not have mental illnesses, the psychological impact of her condition cannot be underestimated. Psychological support and counseling may be beneficial for both of you to cope with the stress and anxiety associated with her condition.\n\n## Reporting to Health Authorities\nIf the symptoms are believed to be related to the vaccine, reporting this to health authorities or vaccine safety monitoring systems could help in understanding any potential rare side effects and may lead to further investigation or support.\n\nIn summary, the combination of neurological, cardiac, and autonomic symptoms suggests a need for a multidisciplinary approach to her care. Ensuring she receives comprehensive and specialized evaluations could help in identifying the underlying cause and finding an appropriate treatment."

        "question": "I\u2019m a 23 year old female. I have recently been getting very dizzy, my body gets hot and seeing stars until my vision disappears completely and I can\u2019t see at all and it doesn\u2019t go away until I lay down or sit. I have never had a problem like this ever but it\u2019s starting to interfere with my life because I\u2019m always having to sit. I\u2019m 5\u201d3 and I weigh around a 100 pounds. My weight does fluctuate a lot (+ or - 5 pounds every week) I try to eat healthy but I also sometimes can\u2019t get myself to eat because I feel anxiety and my heart starts beating weird. I also have epilepsy and I am on Keppra and have been on it for almost 3 years so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem but I try to take it on time, I take 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don\u2019t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time. I add a lot of salt on my food, I eat a lot of olives and a lot of pickles, sometimes I will individually season spoonfuls or food before putting them in my mouth because it\u2019s what tastes good to me (if that is of any significance)And I do drink alcohol about 3 times a week",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several potential causes and factors to consider:\n\n## Heat-Related Issues\nAlthough your symptoms have started recently and are not explicitly linked to high environmental temperatures, heat syncope could be a consideration if you are experiencing these symptoms in hot environments or during physical activity. However, your description does not strongly suggest this as the primary cause[1].\n\n## Medication Side Effects\nWhile you mention that you have been on Keppra for almost three years, it is still possible that medication side effects could be contributing, especially if there have been any recent changes in your dosage or other medications. Common side effects of Keppra include dizziness, fatigue, and vision changes, but since you have been on it for a long time, this might be less likely. However, it is always a good idea to discuss any new symptoms with your healthcare provider[5].\n\n## Low Blood Pressure and Postural Hypotension\nYour symptoms of dizziness, seeing stars, and vision disappearance, particularly when standing up or changing positions, could be indicative of postural hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing). This condition can cause dizziness, faintness, and blurred vision. Your weight fluctuations and occasional lack of appetite might also contribute to low blood pressure[3][4].\n\n## Anxiety and Stress\nAnxiety and stress can lead to physical symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, and a racing heart. Given your mention of anxiety affecting your eating habits and heart rate, this could be a contributing factor. Managing stress through stress-relieving activities, breathing exercises, or consulting a doctor might help alleviate these symptoms[4].\n\n## Hydration and Electrolyte Balance\nYour high salt intake could be relevant, especially if it is affecting your hydration and electrolyte balance. While salt is essential, excessive consumption can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which might exacerbate dizziness and other symptoms. Ensuring you drink enough water and maintain a balanced diet is crucial[1].\n\n## Alcohol Consumption\nDrinking alcohol about three times a week could also be a factor. Alcohol can cause dehydration, affect blood pressure, and lead to dizziness and blurred vision[4%.\n\n## Other Medical Conditions\nOther conditions such as inner ear problems, vision conditions, or even low blood sugar could also be responsible for your symptoms. Given the complexity and the recent onset of these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical issues[3][4].\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: Discuss your symptoms with your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may need attention.\n- **Monitor Blood Pressure**: Check your blood pressure regularly, especially when changing positions, to see if postural hypotension is a factor.\n- **Hydration and Diet**: Ensure you are well-hydrated and maintain a balanced diet. Reduce excessive salt intake and increase water consumption.\n- **Stress Management**: Engage in stress-relieving activities to manage anxiety.\n- **Medication Review**: Discuss your current medication regimen with your doctor to see if any adjustments are needed.\n\nGiven the impact of these symptoms on your life, it is advisable to seek medical advice to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment."

I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation with refractory epilepsy and the consideration of surgical options, here are some alternative and additional treatments you might want to discuss with your specialist:\n\n### Non-Surgical Alternatives\n\n#### Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)\nWhile you mentioned VNS, it's worth noting that both VNS and DBS are less invasive than resective surgeries and can be effective for patients with refractory epilepsy. VNS involves implanting a device that stimulates the vagus nerve, and DBS involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical stimulation[4][5].\n\n#### Ketogenic Diet\nThe ketogenic diet has been shown to be an effective nonpharmacological treatment for some patients with refractory epilepsy. It involves a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that can help reduce seizure frequency[1][2].\n\n#### Radiosurgery\nRadiosurgery is another option that involves delivering high doses of radiation to the seizure focus in the brain. It is less invasive than traditional surgery but can still target specific areas[2].\n\n#### Electroencephalographic Biofeedback\nThis is a technique where patients learn to control their brain activity through feedback, which can help in managing seizures. It is considered an alternative treatment that has shown some efficacy[2].\n\n#### Anti-Inflammatory and Other Pharmacological Approaches\nUsing anti-inflammatory agents or manipulating drug targets (e.g., changing from GABA to NMDA targets) can also be explored. Additionally, strategies like blocking multidrug resistance proteins (MDR1) or using corticosteroids may offer benefits[1].\n\n### Complementary Therapies\n\n#### Acupuncture\nWhile it may seem unconventional, there is some evidence suggesting that acupuncture combined with Western medicine can reduce seizure frequency and improve the quality of life for patients with epilepsy. A meta-analysis showed that acupuncture improved treatment effectiveness and reduced adverse events when used alongside traditional medications[3].\n\n#### Chiropractic Treatment\nThere is limited scientific evidence supporting the use of chiropractic treatment for refractory epilepsy. Most of the available literature does not strongly support its efficacy for seizure control.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n#### Lifestyle Modifications\nContinuing to optimize your lifestyle, including diet and possibly addressing your smoking habit, could have beneficial effects on your overall health and potentially on your epilepsy management.\n\n#### Comprehensive Evaluation\nBefore proceeding with any new treatments, a thorough evaluation in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) can help determine the exact origin and nature of your seizures, which is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment.\n\nIt is essential to discuss these options with your specialist to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific condition and needs."

        "question": "I've been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in two session, I stopped the first time due to cognitive side effects. However I started it again and I'm perplexed. I've always had intense headaches post ECT and during the first session I had intense deja vu experiences 2-10 times per day, this after about 1,5 months lowered to 3 times per week but up to 10 times a day. With this I developed difficulties placing people I've recently met, when I had gotten to know a face something in me just told me that I had known them since long. This time around, everyone I meet I recognise. Yesterday I was hours away from my hometown, and somehow I only met people I knew...but no one said hello...Anyone know information about this occurrence and whether it's a neurological concern or just a temporary side effect? My ECT-nurse had never heard of it before.Info: Male, 24 y/o, Caucasian, mucho depressed, no medications only ECT.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing, particularly the intense headaches, deja vu experiences, and difficulties with recognizing people, can be associated with several aspects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and its effects on the brain.\n\n## Headaches\nHeadaches are a common side effect of ECT, and they can be due to several factors, including changes in serotonergic neurotransmission. Studies have shown that ECT can induce headaches, possibly due to the sensitization of 5-HT2 receptors, which are related to headache genesis[3].\n\n## Deja Vu Experiences\nDeja vu is not typically discussed as a common side effect of ECT, but it could be related to the temporary cognitive disturbances and memory issues that ECT can cause. ECT affects various cognitive domains, including memory and executive functions, and can lead to unusual perceptual experiences. The frequent deja vu experiences might be a manifestation of the temporary disruption in memory and cognitive processing[1][4].\n\n## Recognition Difficulties\nThe feeling of recognizing people you have not met before, or the sensation that you have known them for a long time, could be linked to the cognitive and memory disturbances associated with ECT. ECT can cause retrograde amnesia (forgetting events before the treatment) and anterograde amnesia (difficulty forming new memories after the treatment). It can also affect other cognitive functions, such as recognition and memory consolidation[2][4].\n\n## Neurological Concerns\nWhile these symptoms are likely temporary and related to the ECT treatment, it is important to monitor them closely. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n- **Cognitive Side Effects**: ECT is known to cause various cognitive side effects, including memory impairments, confusion, and executive function deficits. These effects can be transient but may persist in some cases[1][2][4].\n\n- **Deja Vu and Recognition Issues**: These could be transient manifestations of the cognitive disruptions caused by ECT. However, if these symptoms persist or worsen, it would be prudent to discuss them further with your healthcare provider.\n\n- **Consultation**: Given that your ECT nurse had not heard of these specific symptoms before, it might be beneficial to consult with a psychiatrist or a neurologist who can provide a more comprehensive assessment and guidance. They can help determine if these symptoms are within the expected range of side effects or if they indicate a more significant neurological concern.\n\nIn summary, while these symptoms are unusual, they could be related to the known cognitive and memory side effects of ECT. However, due to their unique nature, it is advisable to seek further medical evaluation to ensure there are no underlying neurological issues that need to be addressed."

Could it be something else?I refuse to take anti seizure meds without being confident and the lack of proof makes me weary of doctors who are quick to prescribe such strong meds.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the circumstances, it is crucial to approach the diagnosis with careful consideration, as the symptoms you described could be indicative of several conditions, including but not limited to epilepsy.\n\n### Epilepsy Consideration\n- The symptoms you described, such as involuntary grimacing, slurred or slow speech, and a feeling of illness followed by significant tiredness, could be consistent with certain types of seizures, particularly focal seizures. Focal seizures often involve only one part of the brain and can cause a variety of localized symptoms depending on the brain area affected[1][3][5].\n- However, the absence of clear evidence from EEG and MRI tests, which are commonly used to diagnose epilepsy, makes the diagnosis less clear-cut. Normal results from these tests do not rule out epilepsy entirely, but they do suggest that further evaluation may be necessary[1][3][5].\n\n### Differential Diagnoses\n- **Non-Epileptic Seizures**: These can mimic epileptic seizures but have a psychological origin rather than an electrical one in the brain. Symptoms can include involuntary movements, changes in speech, and feelings of illness, but they are not associated with the abnormal electrical activity seen in epilepsy[4].\n- **Migraines**: Given your history of migraines, it is possible that your symptoms could be related to a migraine variant, such as a complex migraine or a migrainous aura. Migraines can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including nausea, localized pain (which could explain the forehead sensation), and neurological deficits such as speech disturbances[5].\n- **Other Conditions**: Other possibilities include syncope (fainting spells), which you have experienced, and other paroxysmal events that might not be seizures. These conditions need to be carefully differentiated from epilepsy to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment[4].\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: It would be beneficial to have a more comprehensive evaluation, including:\n  - Detailed history taking from both you and any witnesses to the episodes.\n  - Ambulatory EEG or prolonged EEG monitoring to capture any abnormal electrical activity during an episode.\n  - Further neurological examination to assess other possible causes.\n  - Consideration of other diagnostic tests like SPECT or functional MRI if necessary to pinpoint the origin of the symptoms[1][5][4].\n\n### Avoiding Premature Medication\n- Your caution is understandable, and it is important to ensure a definitive diagnosis before starting antiepileptic medications, which can have significant side effects and implications.\n- Discussing your concerns with your neurologist and potentially seeking a second opinion from another neurologist or an epilepsy specialist can help in making a more accurate diagnosis and developing an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn summary, while your symptoms could be indicative of epilepsy, they also suggest the need for a more detailed and cautious approach to diagnosis to rule out other possible causes and ensure the most appropriate treatment."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the context of cocaine use, several potential issues need to be considered:\n\n## Cocaine-Induced Seizure or Neurological Effects\n- The symptoms you described, such as numbness on one side of your face, arm, and tongue, followed by loss of vision, hearing, and eventual loss of consciousness, are consistent with a seizure. Cocaine can lower the seizure threshold, making it more likely for seizures to occur, even in individuals without a prior history of seizures[1][4][5].\n\n## Cardiovascular Complications\n- Cocaine use is known to cause significant cardiovascular effects, including increased blood pressure, heart rate, and vascular stiffness. These effects can lead to acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial ischemia, infarction, or arrhythmias. However, your EKG was normal, which might not indicate an ongoing cardiac issue at the time of the test[2][5].\n\n## Cocaine Overdose\n- The euphoric and safe feeling while unconscious could be related to the intense neurological and cardiovascular effects of cocaine overdose. Overdose can lead to seizures, strokes, and other severe complications, including loss of bladder control and altered consciousness[1][4].\n\n## Post-Seizure or Post-Overdose Effects\n- The fact that you felt euphoric and safe while unconscious and then woke up suddenly could be indicative of a post-seizure or post-overdose state. This can sometimes feel disorienting and may include a sense of relief or euphoria[1][4].\n\n## Medical Evaluation\n- Although your blood sugar and EKG were normal, and the initial blood tests did not reveal any immediate issues, it is crucial to follow up with further medical evaluations. Cocaine use can have long-term effects on the brain and heart, and some complications might not be immediately apparent. A comprehensive neurological and cardiovascular evaluation would be necessary to rule out any underlying conditions that may have been triggered or exacerbated by cocaine use.\n\n## Immediate Action\n- Given the severity of your symptoms, it is important to seek immediate medical attention if you experience anything similar in the future. If you or someone else witnesses a seizure, follow the steps outlined to ensure safety, such as keeping the person safe, protecting their head, and not restraining them during the seizure[4].\n\n## Health Risks and Treatment\n- Considering your history of vaping, smoking weed, and using cocaine, it is essential to address these substance use habits to prevent further health complications. Seeking help from a substance use disorder treatment program could be beneficial for your overall health and well-being[1]."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the symptoms you described, it is unlikely that the muscle twitching you are experiencing is a form of seizure or epilepsy, although it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Muscle Twitching vs. Seizures\n- Seizures typically involve more pronounced symptoms such as loss of consciousness, uncontrollable jerking movements, stiffening of muscles, or strange sensations, which are not described in your case[2][3][5].\n- Your twitching lasts only a second, and you do not experience loss of consciousness or other typical seizure symptoms.\n\n## Possible Causes of Muscle Twitching\n- **Stress and Anxiety**: Muscle twitching can be triggered by mental stress or anxiety, often referred to as \"nervous ticks\"[4].\n- **Lack of Sleep**: Sleep deprivation can cause muscle twitching[1][4].\n- **Dehydration or Poor Nutrition**: Although you mentioned a previous incident linked to dehydration, ongoing twitching could be due to a lack of essential nutrients like potassium, calcium, or vitamin D[1][4].\n- **Medication Side Effects**: Certain medications, such as diuretics, corticosteroids, or estrogens, can cause muscle twitching[1][4].\n- **Caffeine and Other Stimulants**: Consuming caffeine or other stimulants can also lead to muscle twitching[4].\n\n## Specific Situation\n- The fact that the twitching occurs when you try to refocus suggests it might be related to stress or mental fatigue.\n- Since you do not experience pain or fatigue afterwards, and the twitching is brief, it is less likely to be a sign of a severe underlying condition.\n\n## Next Steps\n- It would be wise to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions. They can perform blood tests or other assessments to determine the cause of the muscle twitching.\n- In the meantime, ensure you are getting adequate sleep, staying hydrated, and maintaining a balanced diet. Reducing stress through relaxation techniques and limiting caffeine intake might also help alleviate the symptoms."

        "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The description of your daughter's episodes raises several flags that suggest it would be prudent to consult a medical professional for a thorough evaluation. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Sleep Disorders and ADHD\nChildren with ADHD, like your daughter, are more prone to sleep disorders. However, the specific episodes you described do not fit the typical sleep problems associated with ADHD, such as insomnia, bedtime resistance, or delayed sleep phase, which are commonly reported[3][5].\n\n## Unique Nature of Episodes\nThe structured phases and the specific behaviors during these episodes (e.g., violent rocking, tongue clicking, and urgent requests) are not typical of usual sleep disorders or anxiety-related sleep issues. These behaviors suggest a level of complexity that may require further investigation.\n\n## Awareness and Memory\nThe fact that your daughter remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning and can describe a \"weird\" feeling in her forehead along with visual disturbances (like seeing a clone of herself) is unusual. This level of awareness and memory post-episode is not characteristic of typical sleepwalking or night terrors, which usually involve no memory of the event.\n\n## Recent Medical History\nAlthough the UTI and antibiotic treatment may not seem directly related, any recent medical interventions should be mentioned to the doctor, as they could potentially influence or trigger unusual behaviors.\n\n## Recommendations\nGiven these observations, it would be wise to seek a medical evaluation to rule out other possible causes. Here are some steps:\n\n1. **Consult a Pediatrician or Sleep Specialist**: Discuss the detailed episodes with a pediatrician or a sleep specialist to determine if there might be an underlying sleep disorder or another medical condition that is not immediately apparent.\n\n2. **Neurological Evaluation**: The combination of the \"weird\" feeling in the forehead, visual disturbances, and the structured phases of the episodes might suggest a need for a neurological evaluation to rule out conditions like nocturnal seizures or other neurological disorders.\n\n3. **Anxiety and ADHD Management**: Continue with the therapy for ADHD and anxiety management, but inform the therapists about these episodes so they can adjust their approach accordingly.\n\n4. **Detailed Sleep History**: Provide a detailed sleep history, including any changes or stresses that may have occurred recently (such as the trip and the UTI), to help the doctor understand the context better.\n\nIn summary, while anxiety and ADHD can certainly impact sleep, the specific nature of your daughter's episodes suggests that a comprehensive medical evaluation is necessary to ensure all possible causes are considered."

        "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",

        "answer": "### SSRIs and Worsening Depression\n\nIt is possible for SSRIs, including citalopram, to have an initial or temporary worsening effect on depression, especially in the early stages of treatment or when the dosage is changed.\n\n- Some people, particularly those under 25, may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or worsening of depression symptoms when starting or adjusting the dose of an SSRI[4][5].\n- A phenomenon known as \"Prozac poop-out\" can also occur, where the medication becomes less effective over time, leading to a relapse in depression symptoms[1].\n\n### Safety of Stopping Citalopram\n\nStopping citalopram abruptly is not recommended due to the risk of withdrawal symptoms, which can be severe.\n\n- Withdrawal symptoms from citalopram can include anxiety, confusion, agitation, mood swings, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, sensations that feel like electric shock, seizures, sweating, and insomnia[1][4][5].\n- It is crucial to consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medication. They will likely advise a gradual tapering off of the drug to minimize these symptoms.\n\n### Alternative Antidepressants\n\nGiven your constraints, here are some considerations for alternative antidepressants:\n\n- **Amitriptyline**: This is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and can interact with topiramate, especially since both are sometimes used for migraines. TCAs can also cause drowsiness and other side effects that might not be ideal for you[4][5].\n  - **Interaction**: Amitriptyline and topiramate can both affect the central nervous system, and combining them may increase the risk of sedative effects or other interactions.\n  - **Side Effects**: TCAs like amitriptyline can cause significant drowsiness, weight gain, and other side effects that you might want to avoid.\n\n- **Other Options**:\n  - **Bupropion**: This antidepressant does not cause significant drowsiness and is less likely to exacerbate fatigue. However, it is important to monitor for any potential side effects, including seizures, which could be a concern given your myoclonic jerks.\n  - **Venlafaxine or Duloxetine**: These are serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). They can have different side effect profiles compared to SSRIs and might be an option, but it's essential to discuss the potential for any adverse effects, such as increased anxiety or other symptoms, with your doctor.\n\n### Immediate Actions\n\nGiven the difficulty in getting a GP appointment and your concerns about worsening depression:\n\n- **Contact Emergency Services or a Mental Health Hotline**: If you are experiencing severe depressive symptoms or suicidal thoughts, it is crucial to seek immediate help.\n- **Reach Out to Your GP Again**: Explain your urgent need for an appointment, and they may be able to arrange something sooner or provide temporary advice over the phone.\n- **Do Not Stop Citalopram Abruptly**: Continue taking your medication as prescribed until you can consult with your doctor about a safe and gradual tapering or switch to another medication.\n\nConsulting with a mental health professional or your GP as soon as possible is the best course of action to address your current situation safely."

        "question": "Age 5 Sex male Height 40\u201d Weight40lb Racewhite Duration of complaint 20 months Location Colorado, USA Any existing relevant medical issues CP, epilepsy Current medications Generic keppra 2.5mg/ml 2x daily My 5 yo son with CP and epilepsy My kid is amazing and funny and smart. We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",

        "answer": "Given your concerns and the medical conditions your son is managing, here are some points and strategies that might help you cope and ensure your son has a normal and happy life:\n\n## Managing Seizure Anxiety\n\n- It is common for parents of children with epilepsy to feel overwhelmed and anxious about the possibility of another seizure. However, it's crucial to avoid overprotecting your child, as this can impact their development and independence. Balancing safety concerns with the need for your child to explore and master their environment is key[4].\n\n## Coping Strategies\n\n- **Open Communication**: Talk to your child about their epilepsy and seizures. Let them know it's okay to feel confused or frustrated and that they can express their feelings to you. This open communication can help both you and your child feel more comfortable and less anxious[4].\n\n- **Support Networks**: Join support groups and talk to other parents who have gone through similar experiences. This can help you feel less isolated and more informed about managing your child's condition[4].\n\n- **Professional Help**: Consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you and your child develop positive attitudes towards epilepsy, manage anxiety, and learn relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation[2].\n\n## Seizure Control and Medication\n\n- **Keppra Efficacy**: Your son is currently controlled on generic Keppra, which is effective in managing seizure activity. However, it's important to monitor his condition closely. The likelihood of a breakthrough seizure can vary, but regular follow-ups with his pediatric neurologist or epileptologist can help adjust his treatment plan if necessary[3].\n\n- **Seizure Preparedness**: Knowing what to do during a seizure is crucial. Stay calm, keep your child safe and comfortable, and time the seizure to provide valuable information to healthcare providers. Having rescue medications and being prepared for emergencies can also reduce anxiety[3].\n\n## Daily Life and Activities\n\n- **Maintaining Normalcy**: Encourage your son to participate in activities he enjoys, even if it means taking some risks. Avoid unduly restricting his activities, as this can make him feel vulnerable and overly dependent on others[4].\n\n- **Remote Therapies and School**: While remote therapies and school attendance may be necessary due to COVID-19, try to find ways to balance this with some level of normalcy. Gradually reintroduce in-person activities as safety guidelines allow, to help your son maintain social and physical interactions.\n\n## Personal Well-being\n\n- **Self-Care**: Caring for a child with cerebral palsy and epilepsy can be incredibly stressful. It is essential to monitor your own mental and physical health to prevent burnout. Accept help from friends, family, or support services when you need a break[1][5].\n\n## Technology and Safety\n\n- **Monitoring**: While motion and sound-activated cameras can provide some reassurance, try not to overrely on these tools. Instead, focus on creating a safe environment and having a plan in place for emergencies.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can work towards reducing your anxiety and creating a more balanced, happy life for your son. Regular consultations with his healthcare providers will also help in managing his condition effectively and addressing any changes or concerns that arise."

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

        "answer": "Given the complex and multifaceted nature of your symptoms, it's important to approach this with a comprehensive medical evaluation. Here are some potential considerations and suggestions for what you might discuss with your doctor:\n\n## Epilepsy and Seizure-Like Symptoms\nYour description of \"blanking out\" and losing focus could suggest seizure-like activity, although it is unusual. Conditions like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) or epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening involve seizures that can manifest as brief losses of consciousness or focus. However, your symptoms do not perfectly align with these conditions, and your normal MRI and MRA results reduce the likelihood of a structural cause for epilepsy[1].\n\n## Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)\nFND is characterized by neurological symptoms without an underlying organic neurological disease or damage. Symptoms can include abnormal movements, sensory disturbances, and episodes that resemble seizures. Given your history of trying various treatments without success and the absence of structural abnormalities on imaging, FND could be a consideration. It is often triggered by stress, anxiety, or other psychological factors, and treatment typically involves psychotherapy and rehabilitation[3].\n\n## Vascular Issues\nYour speculation about a subdued artery near the TMJ joint affecting blood flow to the brain is worth discussing. However, normal MRI and MRA results would typically rule out significant vascular abnormalities. Still, it might be worth asking about less common vascular issues or even exploring the possibility of a temporary or intermittent vascular problem that might not show up on standard imaging.\n\n## TMJ and Cervical Spine Issues\nThe temporary relief you experience by manipulating your TMJ joint suggests that there could be an issue related to the TMJ or the surrounding structures, including the cervical spine. While you've already tried upper cervical adjustments and various stretches, further evaluation by a specialist in TMJ disorders or a physical medicine and rehabilitation doctor might provide additional insights.\n\n## Neurological Involvement Post-Infection\nAlthough you didn't mention any recent infections, it's worth noting that neurological symptoms can occur post-COVID-19 or other viral infections. However, your long-standing symptoms make this less likely unless you had an undiagnosed or mild infection in the past that triggered these symptoms[5].\n\n## Psychological and Neurological Intersection\nGiven the impact on your mental status and capabilities, it's crucial to address both the psychological and neurological aspects. Your experience with antidepressants and ADD medications suggests that there may be some overlap with psychiatric conditions, but these did not resolve your primary symptoms. A thorough evaluation by a neurologist or a psychiatrist with a focus on neurology could help clarify the interplay between psychological stressors and neurological symptoms.\n\n## Recommendations for Your Doctor's Visit\n1. **Detailed Symptom History**: Provide a detailed history of your symptoms, including when they started, any patterns you've noticed, and the specific relief you get from manipulating your TMJ joint.\n2. **Previous Evaluations**: Share all previous test results, including MRI and MRA scans, and any treatments you've tried.\n3. **Specialist Referral**: Ask for a referral to a neurologist or a specialist in TMJ disorders to further investigate your symptoms.\n4. **Psychological Evaluation**: Consider a comprehensive psychological evaluation to address any potential psychological components or contributions to your symptoms.\n5. **Further Diagnostic Tests**: Discuss the possibility of additional diagnostic tests, such as EEG for seizure activity, or advanced vascular imaging if necessary.\n\nIt's essential to approach this with an open mind and a willingness to explore multiple potential causes. Your persistence in seeking an explanation and relief is commendable, and working closely with healthcare professionals will likely be key to finding a solution."

        "question": "Female, 40, has a history of seizures but not since 2011, after surgery,  Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "To address your questions about seizures, here are some key points:\n\n## Feeling a Seizure in Your Head\nYes, it is possible to feel a seizure as it begins, particularly if it is a focal seizure. These seizures, such as temporal lobe seizures, often start in a specific area of the brain and can cause distinct sensations before spreading to other parts of the brain.\n\n- **Aura**: Many people experience an aura, which is an early warning sign of a seizure. This can include feelings such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, joy, or strange smells and tastes. These sensations occur because the seizure activity is affecting specific brain areas responsible for emotions, memories, and sensory processing[1][2][5].\n\n## Seizure Progression\nSeizures can indeed start in one area of the brain and spread to other areas. Focal seizures, for example, begin in one part of the brain but can evolve into generalized seizures if the electrical activity spreads to both sides of the brain[4][5].\n\n## EEG and Seizure Detection\nNot all seizures show up on an EEG (electroencephalogram) for several reasons:\n- **Type of Seizure**: EEGs are more effective at detecting seizures with clear electrical discharges, such as those seen in epileptic seizures. However, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) do not show abnormal electrical activity on an EEG because they are not caused by an electrical overload in the brain[3].\n- **Timing and Location**: EEGs may not capture seizure activity if the seizure occurs between tests or if the seizure activity is deep within the brain and not detectable by surface EEG electrodes.\n\n## Unnoticed Seizures\nIt is possible to have a seizure without noticing it or remembering it. This can occur with:\n- **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures**: During these seizures, individuals may appear awake but are not responsive to their surroundings. They may perform repetitive actions like lip smacking or hand movements without being aware of what they are doing. After the seizure, they might be confused, feel sleepy, or have no memory of the event[1][4][5].\n\n## Post-Seizure Sensations\nAfter a seizure, people often experience a post-ictal phase characterized by confusion, tiredness, and various physical and emotional symptoms. Even if the person does not remember the seizure itself, they might feel the after-effects, such as being very sleepy, confused, or having a headache[1][2][5].\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of seizures, including their phases, types, and what it feels like to experience one, you can refer to the articles from the Mayo Clinic and the Epilepsy Foundation[1][2][5]. These sources provide detailed explanations of seizure symptoms, causes, and the different phases involved."

        "answer": "Given your medical history and current health status, there are several factors to consider when deciding about COVID-19 vaccination:\n\n## Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) History\n- You had GBS following mono when you were 17, which is a significant consideration. Studies have shown that the Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine is associated with an increased risk of GBS, particularly within the first 21 days after vaccination. This risk is significantly higher compared to the background rate of GBS and is also higher than the risk associated with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna)[1][4].\n\n## Vaccine Type\n- Given your history of GBS, it is advisable to avoid the Janssen (Ad.26.COV2.S) vaccine. Both the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend using mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) due to their better safety profile, especially regarding GBS and other rare adverse events like thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)[1][4].\n\n## Neurological and Autoimmune Conditions\n- Your history of seizures and current use of antiepileptic medications (Keppra, Clonazepam) is important. Studies have generally shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people with epilepsy, and there is no significant increase in seizure frequency after vaccination. The mRNA vaccines are particularly noted as being relatively safer for patients with epilepsy compared to vector-based vaccines[2][5].\n\n## Autoimmune Diseases\n- You have diagnosed and undiagnosed autoimmune conditions, including Hidradenitis Suppurativa and symptoms suggesting another autoimmune issue (Episcleritis, joint pain, high ESR and CRP). While COVID-19 vaccines have been monitored for safety in various populations, there is no specific contraindication for individuals with autoimmune diseases. However, it's crucial to discuss your specific situation with your rheumatologist to ensure that any potential interactions or exacerbations of your autoimmune conditions are considered.\n\n## Consultation with Healthcare Providers\n- It is prudent to continue consulting with both your neurologist and rheumatologist. Your neurologist's recommendation to get vaccinated is likely based on the overall benefits of vaccination in preventing COVID-19, which can be severe, especially in individuals with underlying health conditions. Your rheumatologist can provide insights into how the vaccine might interact with your autoimmune conditions and current medications.\n\n## Summary\n- Opt for an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) to minimize the risk of GBS.\n- Continue to consult with your neurologist and rheumatologist to address any specific concerns related to your neurological and autoimmune conditions.\n- The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination generally outweigh the risks, especially given your medical history and the potential severity of COVID-19.\n\nBy carefully considering these points and consulting with your healthcare providers, you can make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination that suits your health needs."

        "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

        "answer": "Given the complex and severe symptoms your boyfriend is experiencing, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that his condition may not be solely attributed to panic attacks or anxiety disorders. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n### Duration and Severity of Symptoms\n- The symptoms last 3-6 hours, occur frequently (more than half of the days in a week), and include extreme anxiety, loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades, fainting, and vomiting. These are significantly longer and more severe than typical panic attacks, which usually peak within 10 minutes and last around 10 minutes to an hour[1][3][5].\n\n### Neurological Symptoms\n- Symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred speech, mental confusion, and rapid eye saccades suggest neurological involvement. These are not typical of panic attacks and could indicate a neurological condition that needs to be evaluated[1][3].\n\n### Previous Medical Evaluations\n- Despite negative MRI and EEG results, the Persistence of severe and frequent episodes warrants further neurological evaluation. Other conditions such as epilepsy, transient ischemic attacks, or other neurologic diseases could present with similar symptoms and should be ruled out[1][3][5].\n\n### Diagnostic Gaps\n- The differential diagnosis for panic disorder includes ruling out medical conditions with similar presentations, such as endocrine conditions, cardiopulmonary diseases, and neurologic diseases. Given the severity and nature of the symptoms, it is crucial to ensure that all possible medical causes have been thoroughly investigated[1][3][5].\n\n### Need for Comprehensive Evaluation\n- The current psychiatric treatment does not seem to be adequately addressing the symptoms. Given the complexity of the symptoms and the lack of improvement, a comprehensive evaluation by a neurologist is warranted. This could include additional tests such as electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, or further imaging if necessary.\n\n### Advocacy\n- Since you are experiencing a loop of being directed back to the current doctor without any progress, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from a different psychiatrist or a neurologist. You could also consider reaching out to patient advocacy groups or seeking help from a patient navigator to facilitate the process of getting a referral to a neurologist.\n\n### Urgency\n- Given the suicidal ideation, frequent fainting, and other severe symptoms, the situation is urgent. It is crucial to find a way to get your boyfriend evaluated by a neurologist as soon as possible to rule out any underlying neurological conditions that may be contributing to his symptoms.\n\nIn summary, while anxiety and panic disorders are possible diagnoses, the severity and nature of your boyfriend's symptoms suggest that a more thorough neurological evaluation is necessary to ensure that no underlying medical condition is being missed. Advocating for a referral to a neurologist and seeking a second opinion could be crucial steps in his care."

        "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The presence of both Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) and epilepsy in your son, although seemingly coincidental, can be understood through several points:\n\n## Chiari Malformation and Epilepsy\n- Chiari malformation type 1 is a condition where the cerebellar tonsils descend below the foramen magnum, which can cause various symptoms, but it is not typically associated with epilepsy directly. The primary symptoms of CM1 usually include neck pain, visual disturbances, swallowing difficulties, and other neurological issues rather than seizures[3\u093e\u0964\n- However, there are cases where patients with CM1 can experience seizures, but these are relatively rare. When seizures do occur, they are often part of a broader neurodevelopmental disorder that may include mental retardation, autism, and other somatic dysmorphisms[1].\n\n## Distinguishing Between Seizures and Cerebellar Fits\n- Children with CM1 can sometimes present with \"cerebellar fits,\" which are episodes characterized by drop attacks, abnormal posturing, and respiratory compromise. These episodes can be mistaken for epileptic seizures but are actually due to brainstem dysfunction and compression of the medulla[5].\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- In your son's case, the fact that the medical team has stated that the Chiari malformation and epilepsy are not related suggests that the seizures are likely being managed as a separate condition. The MRI findings of a significant Chiari malformation (with cerebellar tonsils 15 mm below the foramen magnum) are noteworthy, but if the seizures are not attributed to the CM1, they are probably treating the epilepsy based on its own clinical presentation and response to antiepileptic medications like Keppra[1][3].\n\n## Monitoring and Management\n- It is crucial to continue monitoring both the Chiari malformation and the epilepsy independently. For the CM1, symptoms and any potential complications such as syringomyelia or other neurological issues need to be closely watched. For the epilepsy, adjusting medications based on seizure frequency and type will be important.\n- Regular follow-ups with both neurology and neurosurgery specialists will help in managing both conditions effectively.\n\nGiven the complexity of these conditions, maintaining open communication with your son's healthcare providers to ensure that all aspects of his care are being addressed is essential."

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your detailed history and the extensive medical evaluations you have undergone, here are some key points and potential considerations for your episodes of double vision (diplopia):\n\n## Types of Diplopia\nYour experience describes binocular diplopia, as the double vision occurs only when both eyes are open and disappears when one eye is closed. This suggests the issue is related to the alignment or coordination of your eyes rather than a problem within one eye itself[3][5].\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n### Neurological Conditions\nDespite the ruling out of brain masses, scar tissue, and other serious neurological conditions, it is crucial to consider other neurological causes that might not have been fully explored:\n- **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** MS can cause intermittent symptoms, including double vision, due to damage to the nerves controlling eye movements[3][5].\n- **Myasthenia Gravis:** This autoimmune disorder can cause muscle weakness, including the muscles controlling eye movements. It is worth re-evaluating, especially given your recent episode where the double vision was significantly worse[3][5].\n- **Thyroid Dysfunction:** Although you mentioned other conditions were ruled out, Graves' disease or other thyroid disorders can affect eye muscles and cause diplopia[3].\n\n### Eye Muscles and Alignment\n- **Strabismus:** This condition, where the eyes are not correctly aligned, can cause binocular diplopia. It could be a recurring issue from your childhood concussions or other factors[3][5].\n- **Convergence Insufficiency:** This condition involves the inability of the eyes to work together properly, which can lead to intermittent double vision[3].\n\n### Other Factors\n- **Previous Trauma:** Your history of minor concussions and a benzo overdose could potentially contribute to your symptoms, even if no immediate issues were noted at the time. These incidents might have caused subtle damage to the nerves or muscles controlling eye movement[1][5].\n- **Vitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone:** While your vitamin D levels are now normal, it's interesting that the peripheral neuropathy returned. However, your parathyroid hormone levels are normal, which reduces the likelihood of a direct link between these and your diplopia.\n\n## Observations and Next Steps\n\n- **Pattern of Episodes:** The fact that episodes are more frequent during lower light months (September to April) and the recent severe episode suggest there might be an environmental or seasonal component to your condition.\n- **Disorientation and Dizziness:** The feeling of mild disorientation and dizziness when moving during episodes indicates a possible issue with balance and coordination, which could be related to neurological or inner ear problems.\n- **Recent Episode Characteristics:** The significant worsening of double vision in your recent episode, which improved with monocular vision, suggests a possible change or progression in the underlying condition.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Neurological Re-evaluation:** Given the complexity and intermittency of your symptoms, a thorough re-evaluation by a neurologist, possibly with additional tests such as EMG (electromyography) for muscle function or more detailed imaging studies, might be beneficial.\n2. **Eye Specialist:** Consulting with an ophthalmologist or orthoptist who specializes in eye alignment and muscle problems could help identify any issues with strabismus or convergence insufficiency.\n3. **Keep a Detailed Journal:** Continue documenting your episodes, including any triggers or factors that you notice might precede or exacerbate the double vision. This can help in identifying patterns or correlations that might have been missed.\n4. **Consider Other Specialists:** If your symptoms persist or worsen, consulting with an endocrinologist to rule out any underlying hormonal imbalances or a neuro-otologist to assess for any inner ear issues could be helpful.\n\nGiven the ongoing nature of your symptoms and the recent worsening episode, it is important to continue seeking medical attention to ensure that no serious underlying condition is missed."

        "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While there isn't a specific walker or mobility aid that combines a cage, a harness, and a bungee cord system to catch and support an individual in case of a fall, there are several options and considerations you can explore to enhance your brother's safety and mobility:\n\n## Bariatric Walkers and Rollators\nYou can consider using a bariatric walker or rollator, which are designed for individuals with higher weight capacities. These devices can provide stability and balance support, reducing the risk of falls. Bariatric walkers and rollators often come with features such as wide seats for resting, hand brakes for safety, and sometimes forearm supports to help maintain upright posture[4].\n\n## Additional Safety Measures\nTo address the risk of falls during faint spells, you might need to combine a bariatric walker with other safety measures:\n- **Use of a Seat:** Choose a rollator with a sturdy seat that can support your brother's weight. This way, if he feels a faint spell coming on, he can sit down quickly.\n- **Assistive Accessories:** Consider using additional accessories like non-slip mats, grab bars, or other home modifications to reduce fall risks.\n- **Supervision:** Always have someone accompany your brother during walks to provide immediate support if he experiences a faint spell.\n\n## Customized Solutions\nGiven the specific needs of your brother, you may need to explore customized solutions. For example:\n- **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** Discuss your brother's needs with his healthcare provider or a physical therapist who can recommend specialized mobility aids or modifications.\n- **Custom Mobility Aids:** There are companies that create customized mobility aids. You might need to contact manufacturers or organizations that specialize in adaptive equipment to see if they can design something that meets your brother's unique requirements.\n\n## Fall Protection Systems (Not Suitable for Personal Use)\nWhile there are mobile fall protection systems designed for industrial use, such as those mentioned in the sources, these are not suitable for personal mobility aids. These systems are heavy, complex, and not intended for individual use in a home or walking context[2][5].\n\nIn summary, while a bariatric walker or rollator can provide significant support and stability, there is no single device that combines a cage, harness, and bungee cord to catch and support an individual in case of a fall. The best approach would be to use a combination of a sturdy bariatric walker, additional safety measures, and supervision to ensure your brother's safety during walks. Consulting with healthcare professionals and exploring customized solutions can also be beneficial."

Imaging features suggest adenoma with the differential including focal nodular hyperplasia.\"",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the findings from your MRI with contrast, here are some key points to help interpret the results and determine the level of concern:\n\n## Arterially Enhancing Lesions\nThe presence of multiple arterially enhancing lesions in both lobes of the liver indicates that these lesions receive their blood supply primarily from the hepatic artery, a characteristic shared by both benign and malignant liver tumors[4].\n\n## Size and Distribution\n- The largest lesion is 1.8 cm in segment 6 of the right lobe, with several smaller lesions scattered throughout the liver.\n- The size range (from 3 mm to 1.8 cm) suggests a need for careful evaluation.\n\n## Imaging Features\n- **Hyperintense on T2**: This suggests that the lesions have high water content, which can be seen in various types of liver lesions.\n- **Without internal fat**: This helps to rule out some benign lesions like hepatic adenomas with fat content.\n- **No definite washout**: The absence of washout in the delayed phases makes hemangioma less likely, as hemangiomas typically match the blood pool enhancement in each phase[5].\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\nBased on the imaging features:\n- **Adenoma**: This is suggested as a possible diagnosis. Adenomas are benign tumors that can show fast enhancement in the arterial phase and become isodense in the portal venous and equilibrium phases. However, they can have a risk of bleeding, especially if larger than 1 cm[4][5].\n- **Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)**: This is another differential diagnosis. FNH typically shows bright arterial phase enhancement except for a central scar and becomes isodense in the portal venous phase. Central scar enhancement may be visible on delayed phases[5].\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Given your medical history, including epilepsy, migraines, and chronic pancreatitis, and the medications you are on (particularly hormonal contraceptives like Yaz), there is a potential increased risk for certain types of benign liver lesions such as adenomas or FNH.\n- The absence of definite washout and the enhancement pattern argue against more aggressive lesions like hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastases, which typically show rapid washout in the delayed phases[2][5].\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Follow-up Imaging**: Periodic imaging follow-up may be recommended to monitor the size and behavior of these lesions.\n- **Clinical Correlation**: Your clinical history and ongoing symptoms should be correlated with the imaging findings to determine if any immediate action is needed.\n- **Biopsy or Further Evaluation**: Depending on the clinical concern and the lesions' behavior over time, a biopsy or further diagnostic tests might be considered to confirm the nature of these lesions.\n\nIt is crucial to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider or a radiologist to get a comprehensive understanding and to plan the next steps in management."

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your wife's situation and the observations you've described, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Seizure Risk\n- Your wife was prescribed phenytoin after experiencing seizures, which were attributed to the spinal anesthesia from her C-section. The medication is intended to prevent further seizures. Since she has not had any seizures since starting the medication, it appears to be effective in that regard. However, the risk of seizures can still exist, especially if the dosage is adjusted or if the underlying cause is not fully understood. It is crucial to follow the doctor's instructions and monitor her condition closely[1][4].\n\n## Side Effects of Phenytoin\n- The itching she is experiencing could be a side effect of phenytoin. This medication can cause a variety of side effects, including skin rashes, hives, and other dermatological issues. The itching could also be related to other factors, but it is a common enough side effect to warrant discussion with her doctor[1][4].\n- The vibration or shaking sensations in her hands or body could be related to the medication's neurological effects. Phenytoin can cause tremors, loss of coordination, and abnormal body movements, especially if the blood levels are not within the optimal range[1][4].\n\n## Dosage Adjustment\n- The doctor's decision to decrease the dosage from 300mg to 200mg per day may be an attempt to balance the efficacy of the medication with the side effects. However, any changes in dosage should be closely monitored to ensure that the seizures do not return and that the side effects are manageable[1].\n\n## Multiple Sclerosis Concern\n- While the itching and neurological symptoms could be concerning, there is currently no indication from the information provided that suggests Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The symptoms described are more in line with known side effects of phenytoin and the initial seizure activity attributed to the spinal anesthesia. If there are persistent or new neurological symptoms, it would be best to discuss these with her doctor to rule out any other conditions[1][4].\n\n## Monitoring and Follow-Up\n- It is important to keep a close eye on her symptoms and report any changes or new symptoms to her doctor. Regular follow-ups with her healthcare provider will help in adjusting the treatment plan as needed and ensuring that she remains safe and healthy.\n\n## Pregnancy and Future Considerations\n- If she becomes pregnant again in the future, it is crucial to note that phenytoin can have significant risks during pregnancy, including an increased risk of major congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. She should discuss any plans for future pregnancies with her doctor and consider folic acid supplementation as recommended[2][5].\n\nGiven the current situation, it is essential to continue monitoring her symptoms closely and to follow up with her doctor regularly to adjust the treatment plan as necessary."

        "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing are complex and could be associated with several different conditions. Here are some possibilities to consider:\n\n## Panic Attacks or Anxiety\nYour description of a tingling sensation, feelings of dread or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and hyperawareness of your surroundings, followed by dizziness and a light headache, could be indicative of a panic attack. Panic attacks often include physical symptoms such as tingling, chills, dizziness, and a feeling of being out of control, which align with some of the sensations you described[1][3][5].\n\n## Neurological Conditions\nConditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including tingling, numbness, and unusual sensory experiences. The \"MS hug\" and other sensory distortions described in MS patients could somewhat match your experience, although the specific combination of symptoms you mentioned is not typical for MS alone[2][5].\n\n## Migraines or Other Neurological Episodes\nWhile you mentioned that these sensations are different from your migraines with a visual aura, some people experience other types of migraines or neurological episodes that can cause tingling, dizziness, and altered states of awareness. These could be related to various neurological conditions that affect the brain's sensory processing[5].\n\n## Dissociation\nDissociative experiences can involve feelings of detachment from one's body or surroundings, which might align with your description of feeling \"floaty\" and hyperaware. However, dissociation typically involves a disconnection from thoughts, feelings, or bodily sensations rather than an heightened awareness of them[4].\n\n## Other Possible Causes\nOther potential causes could include:\n- **Peripheral Neuropathy**: Although this typically involves more persistent numbness and tingling, especially in the extremities, and is often associated with conditions like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies[1][3][5].\n- **Hormonal or Metabolic Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations or metabolic issues could lead to temporary neurological symptoms, though these are less likely given the specific nature of your symptoms.\n- **Stress and Fatigue**: High levels of stress and fatigue can sometimes manifest in unusual sensory experiences.\n\nGiven the complexity and variability of your symptoms, it would be advisable to consult a healthcare professional, such as a neurologist or a primary care physician, to rule out any underlying medical conditions. They can conduct a thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, medical history, and possibly some diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your symptoms."

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum.

        "answer": "The issues you're experiencing can be attributed to several factors related to your epilepsy management and the decision to stop and then restart your antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\n\n## Risk of Seizure Recurrence\nStopping AEDs after a period of seizure freedom is associated with a significant risk of seizure recurrence. Studies indicate that the risk of recurrence can be as high as 26-63% depending on the patient population and individual risk factors[3][5].\n\n## Individual Risk Factors\nYour history of epilepsy, including the presence of myoclonic seizures and a full-tonic seizure, suggests you may have a higher risk of recurrence. Factors that increase this risk include:\n- Longer duration of epilepsy\n- Presence of multiple seizure types (myoclonic and tonic-clonic)\n- Certain epilepsy syndromes (though your specific syndrome is not explicitly mentioned, your history suggests it could be something like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, which has a higher relapse risk)[1][3][5].\n\n## EEG Findings\nYour EEG results show some abnormalities that could be relevant:\n- \"Foyer de ralentissement localis\u00e9 fronto-temporal bilat\u00e9ral intermittent\" translates to \"localized intermittent slowing in the bilateral fronto-temporal regions.\" This indicates some abnormal brain activity, even though there are no clear epileptiform anomalies. This could suggest an underlying predisposition to seizures that was not fully controlled by medication[1].\n- The absence of epileptiform anomalies does not rule out the risk of seizure recurrence, as these can sometimes be missed or not present at the time of the EEG.\n\n## Medication Management\nThe abrupt change in your medication regimen and the inadequate transitioning between medications likely contributed to the recurrence of seizures. For example:\n- Stopping Keppra and switching to a significantly lower dose of Lamotrigine (from 500mg of Keppra to 25mg of Lamotrigine) is a drastic change that may not have provided adequate seizure control.\n- The lack of clear guidance on how to make this transition and the resulting adjustment period likely increased your risk of seizures[1][3].\n\n## Mental Health Considerations\nWhile your mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, are important, they are not directly causing the seizures but can be affected by the recurrence of seizures. The psychological impact of seizure recurrence can be significant, including effects on self-esteem, stigma, and overall quality of life[1][3][4].\n\n## Recommendations\n1. **Re-evaluate Medication Regimen**: Consult your neurologist to adjust your medication regimen to a dose and combination that provides better seizure control. Given your history, it may be advisable to continue a more effective dose of AEDs.\n2. **Individualized Risk Assessment**: Use individualized prediction tools and thorough risk assessments to determine the best approach for your specific case.\n3. **Gradual Medication Changes**: Ensure any changes to your medication are done gradually and under close medical supervision to minimize the risk of recurrence.\n4. **Regular Follow-Up**: Regular follow-ups with your neurologist are crucial to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as necessary.\n\nBy addressing these factors and working closely with your healthcare provider, you can better manage your epilepsy and reduce the risk of future seizures."

        "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the absence of any known physical conditions, it is crucial to consider several possibilities that could explain these episodes, especially in the context of your existing diagnoses of ASD, GAD, MDD, and ADHD.\n\n## Functional Neurologic Disorder (FND)\nOne potential explanation is a Functional Neurologic Disorder (FND), formerly known as conversion disorder. This condition involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a neurological disease or other medical condition, but are nonetheless real and cause significant distress. Symptoms can include numbness, loss of sensation, difficulty communicating, and other motor or sensory disturbances that cannot be deliberately controlled[2].\n\nYour description of episodes where half your body becomes numb, including specific areas like half of your tongue and nose, and the loss of ability to communicate, aligns with some of the symptoms seen in FND. The episodes being triggered by various and seemingly random circumstances also fits with the unpredictable nature of FND.\n\n## Anxiety and Stress-Related Episodes\nAnother possibility is that these episodes are related to your generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and other psychological conditions. Stress and anxiety can trigger a range of physical symptoms, including numbness, headaches, and sensory sensitivities. The fact that you can sometimes delay these episodes with breathing exercises suggests a link to your anxiety levels[3].\n\n## Complex Interplay with Existing Conditions\nGiven your diagnoses of ASD, ADHD, and MDD, it's also important to consider how these conditions might interact to produce these episodes. For instance, alexithymia (difficulty identifying one's own emotions), which is common in ASD, can lead to complex emotional regulation issues that might manifest physically. Additionally, the executive function deficits and sensory sensitivities associated with ASD and ADHD could contribute to the unique presentation of your symptoms[1][5].\n\n## Further Medical Evaluation\nWhile the above possibilities are plausible, it is essential to undergo a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying neurological or physical conditions that might be causing these episodes. This could include:\n- Repeat neurological exams\n- Advanced imaging tests (e.g., MRI, EEG)\n- Consultations with neurologists and psychologists\n\nA comprehensive assessment can help distinguish between a functional neurologic disorder, an anxiety-related condition, or another underlying cause.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and the potential interplay with your existing diagnoses, it is advisable to seek a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, psychiatry, and psychology to determine the exact nature of these episodes and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your situation, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Diagnosis and Medications\n- The neurologist has diagnosed you with motor tics and ADHD, rather than myoclonic epilepsy, as indicated by the normal EEG results. Motor tics are characterized by sudden, repetitive movements, which align with your symptoms of shoulder jerks and whole-body movements[1][4][5].\n\n## Medications Prescribed\n- **Tetrabenazine**: This is often used to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease but can also be prescribed off-label for other movement disorders, including tics.\n- **Clonidine**: This is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist commonly used to treat ADHD and tics. It can help reduce both ADHD symptoms and tic severity[3][4][5].\n- **Clonazepam**: While this medication is indeed used to treat various seizure disorders, including myoclonic epilepsy, in your case, it has been prescribed for emergency situations to manage severe jerks or tics. Clonazepam can be effective in reducing acute tic episodes[5].\n\n## Concerns About Epilepsy\n- Since your EEG was fine, the neurologist has not found evidence to support a diagnosis of epilepsy. EEG is a primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, and normal results suggest that your jerks are more likely related to motor tics rather than seizure activity[1][4].\n\n## Monitoring and Follow-Up\n- It is crucial to follow up with your neurologist to monitor the effectiveness of the prescribed medications and to adjust the treatment plan as necessary. If you experience any changes or worsening in your symptoms, you should inform your doctor promptly.\n\n## Comprehensive Approach\n- The management of tics and ADHD often involves a combination of medications and behavioral interventions. Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) and other behavioral therapies can be beneficial in managing tics alongside medication[1][4][5].\n\nGiven the normal EEG results and the specific medications prescribed, it appears that your neurologist has addressed your symptoms in the context of motor tics and ADHD rather than epilepsy. However, continuous monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure the treatment plan is effective and to address any new or changing symptoms."

        "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The side effect you're experiencing, often described as \"air hunger\" or a feeling of not getting enough air, is not a commonly listed side effect of Vyvanse or other ADHD medications, but it could be related to several factors:\n\n## Anxiety and Stress\nVyvanse, like other stimulant medications, can cause anxiety and irritability, which might contribute to a sensation of air hunger or discomfort in breathing[1][4][5].\n\n## Physiological Effects\nStimulants can increase heart rate and blood pressure, which may lead to feelings of tension or discomfort that could be misinterpreted as air hunger. Additionally, the dry mouth and dizziness associated with Vyvanse might exacerbate this sensation[1][4][5].\n\n## Management Strategies\n\n### Breathing Techniques\nWhile you mentioned you are familiar with taking full breaths, practicing specific deep breathing exercises or yoga breathing techniques might help alleviate the feeling of air hunger.\n\n### Hydration\nEnsure you are well-hydrated, as dry mouth (a common side effect of Vyvanse) can sometimes be interpreted as a need for more oxygen[1][4].\n\n### Monitor and Adjust Dosage\nDiscuss your symptoms with your psychiatrist. If the air hunger is severe or persists, it might be necessary to adjust the dosage of Vyvanse or consider switching to a different medication. Your psychiatrist may also recommend a different timing for taking the medication to see if it reduces the side effects[1][4][5].\n\n### Addressing Nausea\nGiven that yawning helps temporarily but can lead to nausea, try to manage nausea with small, frequent meals and avoid heavy meals. Ginger or other anti-nausea remedies might also be helpful[1][4].\n\n### Consult Your Healthcare Provider\nIt's crucial to inform your psychiatrist about this specific side effect, as it may indicate a need to reassess your medication regimen. They can provide personalized advice and monitor you closely for any other side effects that may arise.\n\n## Long-term Expectations\nMany side effects of Vyvanse, including those related to anxiety and physiological changes, can be temporary and may reduce as your body adjusts to the medication. However, if the side effects persist or become unbearable, it is important to discuss alternatives with your healthcare provider[1][4][5]."

        "question": "Hi. I just wanna have some guidance in advance if someone can help me :(This hadn't happened to me since March 2020. It happened again last week and sometimes I do feel a bit drowsy or weird but haven't had a full on focal seizure again.What I experienced was:Nausea I saw an aura, or like static? on my right eye that then turned into colors.   My limbs went cold I had a deja vu sensation, like I started to think things I hadn't thought of in two years? I don't know how to explain it I lost all peripheral vision on my right eye for a good while.Speaking was difficult Almost lost consciousness (in 2020 I did lose consciousness and moved my eyes from side to side very rapidly and my face went droopy last time). Back then I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything. Since it never happened again I didn't go see a neurologist but the other day it happened twice so I immediately booked an appointment.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the symptoms you described, it appears you may be experiencing focal seizures, which are characterized by abnormal electrical activity in a limited area of the brain. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Symptoms\n- **Aura**: You mentioned seeing an aura, described as static that turned into colors in your right eye. This is a common precursor to a focal seizure, often referred to as an \"aura\" or \"warning\" sign[5].\n- **Visual Disturbances**: The loss of peripheral vision in your right eye and the colorful static are indicative of focal seizures affecting the visual cortex[1][5].\n- **Deja Vu**: The sensation of deja vu is another common symptom of focal seizures, particularly those originating in the temporal lobe[1][5].\n- **Motor Symptoms**: Your limbs going cold, difficulty speaking, and the potential loss of consciousness are all consistent with focal seizures. In your previous episode, the rapid eye movement and droopy face also align with these seizures[1][5].\n- **Other Sensations**: Nausea, cold limbs, and other abnormal sensations are typical of focal seizures affecting different areas of the brain[1][3].\n\n## Types of Focal Seizures\n- **Focal Aware Seizures**: You were conscious and somewhat aware of your surroundings during the seizure, which is characteristic of focal aware seizures[5].\n- **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures**: Although you were mostly aware, the difficulty in speaking and the near loss of consciousness suggest elements of impaired awareness, which can occur in more severe focal seizures[1][5].\n\n## Causes and Diagnosis\n- Focal seizures can be caused by various factors, including brain injury, stroke, infection, tumors, or genetic predispositions. Given your history, it is crucial to undergo a thorough medical evaluation[1][3].\n- Diagnostic tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), CT or MRI scans, and blood and urine tests can help determine the cause and location of the seizures in your brain[1][3].\n\n## Next Steps\n- Since you have booked an appointment with a neurologist, it is important to provide detailed information about your symptoms and any previous episodes.\n- Be prepared for a comprehensive assessment, including a physical exam, EEG, and possibly imaging tests like CT or MRI scans to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n- The neurologist will help determine the best course of treatment, which could include medications, lifestyle changes, or other interventions to manage and prevent future seizures.\n\nGiven the recurrence of these symptoms, it is essential to follow through with your neurologist appointment to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing share some characteristics with non-epileptic seizures (NES), particularly those of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), but there are also some other factors to consider.\n\n### Characteristics of Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES)\n- NES are often associated with mental health issues such as anxiety, stress, or emotional conflicts. They can manifest as seizure-like activity without any abnormal electrical activity in the brain[1][5].\n- Symptoms can include loss of or change in physical function, such as numbness, tingling, fatigue, pain, headache, poor concentration, memory problems, poor sleep, and blurred vision. Panic attacks, depersonalization, and trembling are also common[1][5].\n- Your symptoms, such as panic attacks, depersonalization, trembling, ptosis, and blurry vision, especially triggered by emotional stress or specific food intolerances, align with some characteristics of NES.\n\n### Other Considerations\n- The presence of food intolerance and significant improvement after passing stool suggests that gastrointestinal issues may also play a role. This could indicate conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other food sensitivities, which can exacerbate or trigger symptoms similar to NES[5].\n- The specific pattern of your symptoms, such as restricted circulation, foggy hearing, and trouble understanding words, might suggest additional underlying issues that need to be investigated. These could be related to anxiety, but also potentially to other neurological or psychiatric conditions.\n\n### Recommended Steps\n- Given the complexity of your symptoms, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist or a psychiatrist, for a comprehensive evaluation.\n- Discussing your full medical history, including the onset of symptoms around puberty and the specific triggers like food intolerance, will help in making an accurate diagnosis.\n- Treatment may involve a combination of psychological therapy (such as counselling or psychotherapy) to address anxiety and stress, as well as management of any underlying gastrointestinal issues[1][5].\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\n- It is important to rule out other possible conditions that could cause similar symptoms, such as neurological disorders, metabolic issues, or other psychiatric conditions like panic disorder or dissociative disorders[3][5].\n\nIn summary, while your symptoms share some characteristics with NES, a thorough medical evaluation is necessary to understand the full scope of your condition and to develop an appropriate treatment plan."

        "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The side effects you are experiencing, such as feeling foggy or almost drunk, are not uncommon for patients taking Keppra (levetiracetam), especially during the initial adjustment period.\n\n### Common Side Effects\n- Dizziness, drowsiness, and weakness are among the most common side effects of Keppra, particularly in the first few weeks of treatment[1][2][5].\n- These symptoms can be more pronounced if the medication is not well-tolerated or if the dose is too high.\n\n### Timing and Administration\n- **Taking with Food**: There is no specific recommendation that Keppra must be taken with food, but taking it with food might help reduce gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea. However, it is not likely to significantly impact the foggy or drunk feeling you are experiencing[2][4].\n- **Taking Before Bed**: Taking Keppra before bed might help minimize the impact of drowsiness during the day, but it may not address the underlying issue of feeling foggy or disoriented. It's important to discuss the timing with your healthcare provider to find the best schedule for your lifestyle and to minimize side effects[2][4].\n\n### Adjusting Your Regimen\n- Since you have already adjusted from twice a day to once a day and still experience side effects, it might be worth discussing further adjustments with your doctor. Here are some points to consider:\n  - **Dose Adjustment**: Your doctor may consider reducing the dose to see if it alleviates the side effects while still providing adequate seizure control[2][4].\n  - **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider can help determine if the side effects are related to the dosage or timing of the medication[1][5].\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Coordination Difficulties**: Keppra can cause coordination difficulties, such as ataxia or abnormal gait, which might contribute to the feeling of being foggy or disoriented. If you experience these symptoms, it is crucial to inform your doctor[1].\n- **Avoiding Alcohol**: While there are no known interactions between alcohol and Keppra, consuming alcohol can worsen side effects like dizziness and sleepiness and may increase the risk of seizures[2].\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: It is essential to discuss your specific side effects with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice on whether the timing of your medication needs to be adjusted or if a different dosage is necessary.\n- **Keep a Symptom Journal**: Keeping track of when you take your medication and when you experience side effects can help your doctor understand the pattern and make informed decisions.\n- **Follow-Up Care**: Regular follow-up appointments will help your doctor assess the effectiveness of the medication and manage any side effects.\n\nBy working closely with your healthcare provider, you can find a balance that minimizes side effects while maintaining effective seizure control."

Duration of complaint - 3 years    Location - Soft palate    Any existing relevant medical issues - Subjective Tinnitus caused by olanzapine and an MRI scan   Current medications - Cinolazepam for sleep, Mysoline for the myoclonus. Is palatal myoclonus treatable?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Palatal myoclonus, characterized by involuntary contractions of the soft palate muscles, is indeed treatable, although the effectiveness and choice of treatment can vary.\n\n## Botulinum Toxin Injections\nOne of the most effective and minimally invasive treatments for palatal myoclonus is the use of botulinum toxin injections, specifically OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). This method involves injecting botulinum toxin into the tensor veli palatini muscle, which can significantly reduce or eliminate the involuntary contractions and associated symptoms like pulsatile tinnitus. Studies have shown that this treatment provides reproducible benefits, although it may require dose titration to minimize side effects such as dysphagia, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and local irritation[1][5].\n\n## Medications\nOther treatment options include medications such as:\n- **Benzodiazepines**: Clonazepam, which you are already taking, can help reduce the dysfunctional movements by its GABA agonistic properties[5].\n- **Anticonvulsants**: Sodium valproate and piracetam have also been used to treat palatal myoclonus, although their effectiveness can vary[3][5].\n\n## Additional Measures\nSome patients may benefit from simpler maneuvers or devices, such as:\n- **Sensory tricks**: Actions like pushing the palate with the thumb, wide mouth opening, or performing the Valsalva maneuver can temporarily reduce the movements.\n- **Dental devices**: Acrylic plates may help improve phonetics and oral motor function[5].\n\n## Considerations\nGiven your current medications (clonazepam for sleep and Mysoline for myoclonus) and the side effects associated with olanzapine (subjective tinnitus), it might be beneficial to discuss the option of botulinum toxin injections with your healthcare provider. This could offer a more targeted approach to managing your palatal myoclonus while potentially reducing the reliance on other medications that may have unwanted side effects[1][3][5].\n\n## Monitoring and Follow-Up\nRegular follow-up and monitoring are crucial to adjust the treatment plan as needed, especially if you decide to proceed with botulinum toxin injections, to ensure optimal results and minimize any adverse effects."

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the various symptoms you're experiencing, here are some key points and considerations related to your conditions and the imaging you've had:\n\n## Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)\n- You had a CVST in 2019 involving the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and jugular vein. MRI and MRV are critical for diagnosing CVST, with MRV, especially contrast-enhanced MRV (CE-MRV), having the highest diagnostic accuracy[1][4].\n- The presence of Factor V Leiden mutation increases your risk for venous thrombosis, which aligns with your history of DVT in 2012 and CVST.\n\n## Epilepsy and Temporal Lobe Seizures\n- Your diagnosis of complex partial seizures originating in the right temporal lobe explains symptoms such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, zoning out, and blacking out. These seizures can also cause automatisms, like teeth clenching and stuttering, which you have experienced[2][5].\n- The seizures might be related to the CVST or could be a separate condition. Temporal lobe seizures can result from various causes, including scars in the temporal lobe, which might be a consideration given your history.\n\n## Current Symptoms\n- Your temperature regulation issues, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and insomnia could be related to stress, anxiety, or possibly the neurological impact of the CVST and epilepsy. Exploding head syndrome, as mentioned by your psychiatrist, often involves a psychological component but can also be linked to underlying neurological issues.\n- The ongoing temperature regulation problems, such as burning up or freezing, are unusual and might warrant further investigation to rule out other conditions affecting your autonomic nervous system.\n\n## MRI and Imaging\n- Since you have access to your MRI, MRA, and MRV images from 2019 and 2021, reviewing these with a specialist could provide insights into any changes or new findings. Given the low diagnostic yield of MRI for CVST when it is not present (only 1.5% in one study), other significant intracranial pathologies might be more relevant to your current symptoms[1].\n- The use of different MRI sequences, such as T1SE, T2*SW, and MRV, can help in detecting residual or new venous thrombosis and other intracranial abnormalities[4].\n\n## Follow-Up and Specialist Consultation\n- Your neurologist's suggestion to consult specialists at a center like Cornell is likely aimed at getting a comprehensive review of your complex conditions. Given the COVID-19 situation, telemedicine or remote consultations might be an alternative if in-person visits are not feasible.\n- It is crucial to continue monitoring your epilepsy and CVST with regular follow-ups and to adjust your medications as necessary. The fact that you have rare migraines now after being medicated with Eliquis suggests that your current treatment plan is having some positive effects.\n\n## Medications and Side Effects\n- You have experienced significant side effects from certain medications (Warfarin, Zonisamide). Continuing with your current medications (Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra) and avoiding those that caused adverse reactions is important. The occasional use of Xanax and rare use of Ambien should be monitored closely due to potential side effects and interactions.\n\nGiven your complex medical history and the various symptoms you are experiencing, a thorough review by a specialist, potentially through telemedicine if in-person visits are challenging, would be highly beneficial. This could help in clarifying the relationships between your CVST, epilepsy, and other symptoms and in optimizing your treatment plan."

        "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

        "answer": "To address your concerns about the cancer risk associated with the CT scans you underwent, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Radiation Dose from CT Scans\n- Each CT scan exposes you to a certain amount of ionizing radiation, measured in millisieverts (mSv). The doses from your scans are as follows:\n  - Head scans: typically around 1-2 mSv each, but your specific doses were higher due to the DLP (Dose Length Product) values provided (e.g., 1005.29, 799, 763, 881.17 mGy.cm). However, converting DLP to effective dose is complex and generally results in a dose range of about 1-5 mSv per head scan[4][5].\n  - Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis scans: these typically range from 5-10 mSv each. Your specific scans had DLP values that translate to effective doses in this range (e.g., 652, 1291.11 mGy.cm)[4][5].\n\n## Cumulative Radiation Exposure\n- Your cumulative exposure from the 7 CT scans would be estimated to be in the range of 20-50 mSv, depending on the exact conversion of DLP to effective dose. For perspective, the average person receives about 3 mSv per year from natural background radiation[4][5].\n\n## Cancer Risk\n- Studies indicate that while there is a risk of cancer associated with ionizing radiation from CT scans, this risk is generally low. The linear-no-threshold (LNT) model suggests that any amount of radiation increases cancer risk, but the actual risk at low doses is difficult to quantify precisely. However, it is estimated that the risk of developing a fatal cancer from a single CT scan is about 1 in 2,000[4][5].\n- For multiple scans, the risk increases but remains relatively low. A cumulative dose of up to 100 mSv (approximately 10 scans) still results in a low overall risk of cancer[5].\n\n## Comparison to Other Groups\n- **Radiation Workers**: These individuals are exposed to higher levels of radiation over their careers, often exceeding 100 mSv per year. Your exposure is significantly lower than what radiation workers would accumulate in a single year.\n- **Patients Treated with Radiation Therapy**: These patients receive much higher doses of radiation, often in the range of several thousand mSv, which is orders of magnitude higher than your cumulative exposure.\n- **Pilots**: Commercial airline pilots receive about 2-5 mSv per year from cosmic radiation. Your cumulative exposure from the CT scans is comparable to a few years of a pilot's exposure.\n- **Survivors of Erratic Radiation Exposure**: These individuals often receive much higher and more acute doses of radiation, far exceeding what you were exposed to.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the data and the context, your worries about cancer risk from the CT scans, while understandable, are relatively irrational compared to the actual low risk involved. Here are some key takeaways:\n- The benefits of the CT scans in diagnosing and managing your health conditions likely outweigh the risks associated with the radiation exposure.\n- Your cumulative exposure, while higher than average due to the number of scans, is still within the low-risk range.\n- It is important to keep a record of your radiation exposure, as suggested, but in your case, the exposure levels do not indicate a significant cancer risk[4].\n\nMoving forward, it is crucial to follow up with your healthcare providers and ensure that any future imaging is justified and optimized to minimize radiation exposure. However, based on the current evidence, your exposure does not significantly elevate your cancer risk."

        "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The vagus nerve, also known as cranial nerve 10, is a complex and multifunctional nerve that plays a crucial role in various physiological and psychological processes. Here\u2019s a breakdown of its functions and the potential benefits of stimulating it:\n\n## Functions of the Vagus Nerve\n- The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve, extending from the brainstem (medulla oblongata) down to the abdomen, passing through the neck, thorax, and into the abdominal organs[1][4][5].\n- It is a key component of the parasympathetic nervous system, often referred to as the \"rest and digest\" system, which helps to calm the body and counteract the \"fight or flight\" response of the sympathetic nervous system[1][4][5].\n- The vagus nerve provides motor parasympathetic fibers to most organs from the neck to the second segment of the transverse colon, influencing heart rate, gastrointestinal peristalsis, and other visceral functions. It also controls some skeletal muscles involved in swallowing, speech, and other functions[1].\n- Approximately 80-90% of the fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent, meaning they carry sensory information from the body's organs to the central nervous system, providing continuous feedback about the state of the body's viscera[1][5].\n\n## Benefits of Vagus Nerve Stimulation\n- **Digestion**: Stimulating the vagus nerve can indeed influence digestion by enhancing gastric emptying and stimulating acid production in the stomach[1][5].\n- **Heart Rate and Blood Pressure**: The vagus nerve helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure through its parasympathetic influence, which can help lower these parameters when they are elevated[1][4].\n- **Anxiety and Mental Health**: There is substantial evidence that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can have positive effects on mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). VNS has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, including postpartum depression, and can help regulate inflammation, which is often associated with psychological illnesses[2][4][5].\n- **Inflammation**: The vagus nerve has anti-inflammatory properties, and stimulating it can help reduce chronic inflammation, which is beneficial for various inflammatory conditions[2][5].\n- **Weight Management**: Studies have shown that VNS can help in weight management by delaying gastric emptying and enhancing the release of anorexigenic hormones, leading to reduced food intake[3].\n- **Other Benefits**: VNS has also been used to treat epilepsy, aid in stroke rehabilitation, and reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal. It can help in stress recovery and improve overall well-being by promoting a calm state and reducing the body's stress response[2][3][4].\n\n## Is Stimulating the Vagus Nerve Effective?\nThe scientific evidence supports the efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation for several medical and psychological conditions. While some claims on social media might be exaggerated or lack specific scientific backing, the core benefits of VNS are well-documented in clinical research.\n\n- For medical conditions, VNS is approved by regulatory bodies like the FDA for treating depression, epilepsy, and other conditions[2][3].\n- Non-invasive methods to stimulate the vagus nerve, such as deep breathing, physical exercise, and certain meditation practices, can also be beneficial for general well-being and stress reduction[4][5].\n\nIn conclusion, stimulating the vagus nerve is not \"bullshit\" but rather a scientifically supported therapeutic approach with a range of potential benefits, particularly in the areas of digestion, mental health, and inflammation management. However, it is important to consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice and treatment, especially if you are considering VNS for a specific medical condition."

        "question": "i was diagnosed when i was young with a seizure thing that goes away when youre 13, which impairs my ability to concentrate and gave me seizures while im sleeping about once every blood moon and my mom told me it was epilepsy, but see the thing is that shes not very good with english, and i have never had any trouble with seeing flashing lights. is it possible to have epilepsy but no trouble with seeing flashing colors?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Yes, it is entirely possible to have epilepsy without experiencing visual disturbances such as seeing flashing colors or lights. Epilepsy is a broad term that encompasses various types of seizures, each with different symptoms depending on the part of the brain affected.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n## Types of Seizures\n- **Focal Aware Seizures (FAS):** These seizures, previously known as simple partial seizures, can involve a wide range of symptoms, including motor symptoms like lip-smacking, chewing movements, or repetitive jerking, and non-motor symptoms such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, unusual smells or tastes, or a rising feeling in the stomach. Visual disturbances are not a universal symptom[1][3][5].\n\n## Specific Lobe Seizures\n- **Temporal Lobe Seizures:** These can involve feelings of fear, anxiety, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or unusual smells and tastes, but not necessarily visual disturbances[3][5].\n- **Frontal Lobe Seizures:** These often involve motor symptoms like thrashing or bicycling movements of the extremities, particularly during sleep, without necessarily involving visual symptoms[3].\n\n## Absence Seizures\n- While some seizures can involve visual disturbances, absence seizures typically do not. They are characterized by a brief loss of awareness, often with staring and sometimes blinking, but no significant visual symptoms[3][4][5].\n\n## Your Specific Case\n- If you experienced seizures primarily during sleep and had issues with concentration, it could be related to a form of epilepsy that does not involve visual disturbances. The fact that your seizures occur about once every \"blood moon\" (which is not a medical term but could imply a rare or periodic occurrence) suggests a specific type of epilepsy that may not include visual symptoms.\n\nGiven the variability in epilepsy symptoms, it is plausible that you have a form of epilepsy that does not involve seeing flashing colors or lights. A thorough medical evaluation, including electroencephalogram (EEG) tests and a detailed history of your symptoms, would be necessary to determine the exact type of epilepsy you might have."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Radiation necrosis (RN) of the brain is a complex and challenging condition, and its progression and treatment options are not straightforward.\n\n### Healing and Progression of Radiation Necrosis\n\nRadiation necrosis is generally considered a serious and often irreversible condition, although some cases can show improvement with treatment.\n\n- **Irreversibility**: Traditionally, RN was viewed as a progressive and irreversible condition. However, recent studies suggest that some cases can be managed and even improved with various treatments[3][5'.\n- **Treatment Outcomes**: Studies have shown that treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), bevacizumab, and other interventions can lead to clinical and radiological improvements in some patients. For example, HBOT has been shown to improve oxygenation in affected brain tissues, reduce swelling, and enhance neurological function[1].\n- **Variability in Response**: The response to treatment can vary widely among patients. Some may experience significant improvements, while others may not show much change or may even worsen[1][5].\n\n### Symptoms and Diagnosis\n\nThe symptoms you are experiencing, such as blurry vision, slow thought processing, confusion, and muscle twitching, can be indicative of radiation necrosis, especially given your history of gamma knife treatments.\n\n- **FLAIR Hyperintensity**: FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) hyperintensity on MRI is often associated with radiation necrosis. It indicates areas of brain tissue damage and edema, which can result from the radiation-induced vascular injury and disruption of the blood-brain barrier[3][5].\n\n### Comparison to Ischemic Stroke\n\nWhile radiation necrosis is distinct from an ischemic stroke, both conditions involve tissue damage due to different mechanisms.\n\n- **Radiation Necrosis**: This condition is caused by radiation-induced vascular injury, leading to tissue necrosis and edema. It does not involve an acute blockage of blood flow like an ischemic stroke but rather a gradual process of tissue damage[3][5].\n- **Ischemic Stroke**: This is caused by the sudden blockage of blood flow to an area of the brain, leading to rapid tissue ischemia and necrosis.\n\n### Swelling and Edema\n\nSwelling and edema are common in radiation necrosis due to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and increased vascular permeability.\n\n- **Edema Management**: Treatments like glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone) are commonly used to control edema associated with radiation necrosis. Other treatments, including HBOT and anti-VEGF therapy, can also help reduce swelling and improve symptoms[1][3][5].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven your symptoms and the findings on your MRI, it is possible that you are experiencing radiation necrosis. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n- **Seek Medical Consultation**: It is crucial to discuss your MRI results and symptoms with your doctor to get a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\n- **Treatment Options**: Depending on the severity and your overall health, your doctor may recommend treatments such as HBOT, bevacizumab, or other interventions to manage your symptoms and slow the progression of RN.\n- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is essential to monitor the progression of the condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n\nUntil you see your doctor in June, it might be helpful to keep a detailed record of your symptoms and any changes you notice, which can aid in your medical evaluation."

        "question": "Sex: M Age 48 Weight 235lbs Height: 6ft 2\" non smoker, non drinker epilepsy since birth, had his hemispheres separated about 15 years ago. Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The scenario described involves several complex factors that influence your husband's epilepsy and seizure management. Here are some key points and potential considerations:\n\n## Headaches and Seizures\nThe headaches your husband experiences before his seizures are not uncommon. Headaches can be closely linked to seizures, and they can occur at various times relative to the seizure:\n- **Pre-ictal headaches**: These occur before a seizure and can be a warning sign. Studies have shown that headaches, especially migraine-like headaches, can precede seizures[2][5].\n- **Post-ictal headaches**: These occur after a seizure and are also common[2][5].\n\n## Triggers and Risk Factors\nSeveral factors can increase the frequency and severity of seizures, some of which may be relevant to your husband's situation:\n- **Sleep Deprivation**: This is a known risk factor for increased seizure frequency. Ensuring adequate sleep could help manage seizures[1][4].\n- **Head Injuries**: While your husband had a significant surgical intervention 15 years ago, any subsequent head injuries could still impact his seizure frequency[1][4].\n- **Depression and Mental Health**: The use of anti-depressants suggests that mental health is being managed, but ongoing monitoring and adjustment of mental health treatment may be necessary to minimize its impact on seizure frequency[1][3].\n\n## Medication and Treatment\n- **Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs)**: The neurologist's decision to increase the dosage of Tegretol (carbamazepine) is a common approach to manage increasing seizure frequency. However, it might be beneficial to discuss other treatment options or adjustments, especially given the severity and duration of some seizures[1][3].\n- **Medication Adherence**: Ensuring consistent adherence to medication can significantly impact seizure control. Factors like substance use (though your husband does not use substances) and mental health issues can affect adherence[1][4].\n\n## Seizure Duration and Postictal State\n- **Status Epilepticus**: A seizure lasting over 15 minutes, as in your husband's case, is a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This condition can lead to brain damage or other severe complications. Close monitoring and prompt medical intervention are crucial[3].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Surgical and Neurological History**: The separation of hemispheres (hemispherectomy) 15 years ago is a significant surgical intervention. Any changes or calcifications seen on CT scans should be closely monitored, even if they are deemed normal and unchanged. Regular follow-ups with the neurologist are essential to adjust treatments accordingly.\n- **Lifestyle and Environmental Factors**: Keeping track of any triggering factors such as noise, light, or stress can help in managing seizures better[4].\n\n## Management and Improvement\nTo better manage your husband's seizures:\n- **Seizure Diary**: Keeping a detailed diary of seizures, including any pre-ictal symptoms like headaches, can help identify patterns and potential triggers.\n- **Regular Neurological Follow-Ups**: Continuous monitoring by a neurologist is crucial to adjust medications and other treatments based on the evolving needs.\n- **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Ensuring adequate sleep, avoiding known triggers, and maintaining good mental health can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.\n- **Support and Education**: Being informed about epilepsy and its management can help both you and your husband cope better with the condition.\n\nWhile some aspects of living with epilepsy may be inherent, proactive management and continuous monitoring can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, here are several factors and potential causes to consider for your frequent and widespread muscle cramps:\n\n## Medication Side Effects\nSeveral medications you are taking could contribute to muscle cramps:\n- **Diuretics and other medications**: While you didn't mention taking diuretics, some of your medications might interact or have side effects that impact electrolyte balance. For example, Keppra (levetiracetam) is generally well-tolerated, but it can have rare side effects. Trintellix (vortioxetine) and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) are less commonly associated with muscle cramps, but interactions or individual responses can vary[1][3][5].\n\n## Electrolyte Imbalance\nMuscle cramps can be caused by imbalances in essential minerals and electrolytes such as magnesium, potassium, calcium, and sodium. This imbalance can be exacerbated by various factors, including dehydration, which might occur even if you are not highly active[1][3][5].\n\n## Underlying Medical Conditions\nAlthough you mentioned not having other underlying physical conditions, it's important to rule out any potential issues:\n- **Atherosclerosis**: Narrowed arteries can reduce blood supply to muscles, leading to cramps.\n- **Thyroid disorders**: Even if you're not aware of a thyroid condition, it could be contributing to your muscle cramps.\n- **Nerve compression**: Conditions like sciatica or spinal nerve irritation could cause muscle cramps[1][3][5].\n\n## Dehydration and Physical Factors\nDespite not being highly active, dehydration can still occur, especially if you are not drinking enough water throughout the day. Additionally, standing for long periods at work could contribute to muscle fatigue and poor circulation, which can lead to cramps[1][3][5].\n\n## Epilepsy and Seizure Medications\nWhile your epilepsy is managed with Keppra, it's essential to consider if the seizures or the medication could be influencing your muscle cramps. However, the symptoms you described do not align closely with myoclonic seizures, which are brief, jerking spasms typically associated with specific epilepsy syndromes[2][4].\n\n## Other Considerations\n- **Vaping**: Although the direct link between vaping and muscle cramps is not well-established, vaping can impact overall health and potentially exacerbate existing conditions.\n- **Hormonal Effects**: Oral birth control (BC) can sometimes affect electrolyte balance, although this is less common.\n\n## Recommendations\nGiven the frequency and severity of your muscle cramps, it is advisable to:\n- **Consult your healthcare provider**: Discuss your medications, lifestyle, and symptoms to identify any potential interactions or underlying conditions that might be contributing to the cramps.\n- **Monitor electrolyte levels**: Get your electrolyte levels checked to ensure there are no significant imbalances.\n- **Hydration and diet**: Ensure you are well-hydrated and maintain a balanced diet rich in essential minerals and electrolytes.\n- **Stretching and physical fitness**: Regular stretching and improving overall physical fitness can help reduce muscle cramps.\n- **Adjust medications**: If necessary, your healthcare provider may adjust your medications to see if that alleviates the symptoms.\n\nIt is crucial to have a thorough medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your frequent and widespread muscle cramps."

        "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The episodes you are describing could be related to both anxiety and your history of epilepsy, and it's important to distinguish between the two or determine if they are interconnected.\n\n### Anxiety and Panic Attacks\n- The symptoms you described, such as heart palpitations, breathing problems (possibly hyperventilation), overwhelming fear, and panic attacks, are typical of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder[2][5].\n- The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feeling and the sense of impending doom or fear could also be part of a panic attack or an anxiety episode[2][5].\n\n### Connection to Epilepsy\n- D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a common aura symptom in people with epilepsy, especially those with temporal lobe epilepsy. It can be a warning sign that a seizure is about to occur[3][4].\n- However, in your case, since you have not had a seizure in two years and are on medication (Levetiracetam), it is possible that these episodes are not directly related to seizures but could be influenced by your anxiety.\n- Anxiety is a common comorbidity with epilepsy, and stress or anxiety can sometimes trigger seizures or seizure-like symptoms in individuals with epilepsy[2][5].\n\n### Psychogenic D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\n- There is also the possibility of what is called \"psychogenic d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" where the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is driven by psychological factors such as anxiety rather than a neurological cause. This has been documented in cases where there is no clear neurological basis for the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu[1].\n\n### Recommendations\n- Given the frequency and impact of these episodes, it is crucial to consult your doctor or an epilepsy specialist. They can help determine if these episodes are related to your epilepsy, anxiety, or a combination of both.\n- A thorough evaluation, including possibly EEG monitoring, may be necessary to rule out any underlying neurological causes.\n- Your doctor may also consider adjusting your treatment plan, including counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or adjusting your medication to better manage both your epilepsy and anxiety[2][5].\n\nIn summary, while the episodes you are experiencing share characteristics with both anxiety attacks and epilepsy-related auras, a comprehensive medical evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical background, there are several potential causes and considerations that need to be addressed:\n\n## Lightheadedness and Dizziness\nThe feeling of lightheadedness and dizziness, particularly when exhaling, could be related to several factors:\n- **Anemia**: Although you are taking iron and other blood-building supplements, anemia can still cause dizziness and lightheadedness due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain[2][5].\n- **Blood Pressure Changes**: Sudden drops in blood pressure, especially when standing up or during normal breathing, can lead to lightheadedness. This could be exacerbated by medications or underlying conditions[2][4].\n- **Breathing and Circulation**: The sensation you describe during exhaling might suggest a transient reduction in blood flow or oxygen delivery to the brain. However, this is less common and would need further investigation.\n\n## Additional Symptoms\n- **Brain Sensations**: The feelings of your brain being \"full and nourished\" when inhaling and worsening when exhaling, along with sensations of vibration, electrical feelings, or a surge of chemicals, are unusual and may indicate a neurological component. These could be related to anxiety, stress, or an underlying neurological condition[5].\n- **Jerking and Twitching**: The episodes of jerking, twitching, and shaking, especially upon waking, could be indicative of a neurological issue such as myoclonus or a seizure disorder, although you mentioned you are not epileptic. These symptoms warrant immediate medical attention to rule out any serious conditions[5].\n\n## Immediate Actions\n- **Seek Medical Attention**: Given the severity and the combination of your symptoms, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider as soon as possible. Your provider will need to conduct a thorough physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and may order tests such as blood work, EEG, or imaging studies to determine the cause of your symptoms[1][2][5].\n- **Emergency Signs**: If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, or severe and persistent dizziness, seek emergency medical attention immediately, as these could be signs of a serious condition such as a heart problem or stroke[1][3][5].\n\n## Potential Underlying Conditions\n- **Neurological Conditions**: Your symptoms could be related to a neurological condition affecting the brain or nervous system. Conditions such as vestibular neuronitis (inflammation of the vestibular nerve) or other inner ear disorders could also contribute to dizziness and vertigo[2][5].\n- **Anxiety and Stress**: High levels of stress or anxiety can cause symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, and jerking movements. Evaluating your stress levels and mental health may also be necessary[3][5].\n\nGiven the complexity and severity of your symptoms, a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare provider is essential to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment."

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several indicators that suggest you might be experiencing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Symptoms and History\n- **Auras and Pre-Seizure Feelings**: Your description of feeling like you were going to throw up and the subsequent deja vu feeling after blacking out are consistent with the auras often experienced by people with TLE. Auras in TLE can include a variety of sensations such as fear, an unpleasant smell, or changes in perception[3][5].\n- **Repetitive Seizures**: Having grand mal seizures once a year since 2017, which may have started as focal seizures, aligns with the pattern seen in TLE where seizures can occur periodically[3][5].\n- **Abnormal EEG Activities**: The presence of abnormal electrical activities on the left side of your brain, as indicated by your EEGs, is a significant finding. EEGs are crucial in diagnosing and localizing the source of seizures, and abnormalities in one area can point to TLE[1][3][5].\n\n## Past Experiences\n- **Childhood Symptoms**: Your descriptions of strange feelings where sounds seemed aggressive and urgent, and experiences of distorted perceptions (e.g., the ceiling being far away and hands feeling bigger), could be indicative of early symptoms of TLE. These can be subtle and may not always be recognized as seizure-related at the time[5].\n- **Unusual Breakdowns**: The unusual breakdowns you experienced as a child, such as refusing to go to a familiar place without a reasonable explanation, could be related to the emotional and behavioral changes associated with TLE[1][5].\n\n## Other Factors\n- **Deja Vu**: Frequent deja vu experiences are common in people with TLE. Deja vu is often described as a feeling of familiarity or recognition that is not based on actual memory[5].\n- **Medical History**: Your history of infections, such as mononucleosis, and the removal of your tonsils could be relevant, as certain infections and brain injuries can contribute to the development of TLE[3][5].\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Specialized Neurologist**: It is appropriate that your current neurologist referred you to a specialist in epilepsy, as TLE requires specific expertise for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n- **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation**: Continue with the recommended diagnostic tests, which may include additional EEGs, video-EEG telemetry, MRI, and other imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis and localize the seizure focus[1][3][5].\n- **Treatment Options**: Depending on the diagnosis, treatment options may include anti-epileptic medications, vagus nerve stimulation, or even surgical interventions like temporal lobectomy if medications are ineffective[1][3][5].\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for specialized care, it is crucial to continue working with your neurologist and any other specialists they recommend to get a thorough diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan."

        "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Elevated eosinophil levels, as in your case, can be indicative of several underlying conditions, even if there is no actual parasite infection. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Causes of Eosinophilia\nEosinophilia, which is defined as an eosinophil count of more than 500 cells per microliter of blood, can be caused by a variety of factors. Common causes include:\n- **Allergic disorders**: Such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and drug allergies. However, you mentioned you have no allergies[2][3][5].\n- **Parasitic infections**: Although your doctor mentioned no actual parasite, this is often a common cause. Since you haven't been abroad, this is less likely[2][3][5].\n- **Cancers and blood disorders**: Conditions like Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and certain myeloproliferative neoplasms can cause eosinophilia[1][2][5].\n- **Autoimmune diseases**: Such as inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), autoimmune myocarditis, and vasculitis[3][5].\n- **Other medical conditions**: Including eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic asthma, and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)[1][3][5].\n\n## Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)\nGiven your high eosinophil count (22% which translates to a significantly elevated absolute count), HES is a possibility, although it is more common in older men. HES is characterized by an eosinophil count of more than 1,500 cells per microliter of blood for more than 6 months without an obvious cause. It can lead to organ damage, particularly affecting the heart, lungs, liver, skin, and nervous system[1][2][4].\n\n## Symptoms and Diagnosis\nOften, people with mild eosinophilia may not have symptoms, but high levels can cause inflammation and damage to various organs. Since you are asymptomatic aside from concerns related to your epilepsy medications, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause. Your hematologist will likely conduct additional tests, including biopsies if necessary, to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis[1][2][3].\n\n## Impact of Current Medications\nWhile your current medications for epilepsy could have various side effects, it is less likely that they would directly cause such a significant elevation in eosinophils. However, it's important to discuss all your medications with your hematologist to rule out any drug-related causes[2][3].\n\n## Next Steps\nGiven your upcoming appointment with a hematologist, here are a few things to expect:\n- **Further testing**: To determine the underlying cause of the eosinophilia, including tests for infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.\n- **Biopsies**: If tissue eosinophilia is suspected, biopsies may be necessary to examine the affected organs.\n- **Treatment**: Will depend on the underlying cause. For example, if an allergic reaction or medication is the cause, stopping the offending agent may resolve the issue. If it's due to a more serious condition like HES, treatment may involve corticosteroids, chemotherapy agents, or other targeted therapies[1][2][3].\n\nIt is important to follow up with your hematologist and provide them with all the details about your medical history, current medications, and any symptoms you might be experiencing."

        "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing do not typically align with the characteristics of epilepsy, particularly when considering the nature and triggers of your experiences.\n\n### Key Differences from Epilepsy\n\n- **Seizure Characteristics**: Epileptic seizures are usually marked by more pronounced and disruptive symptoms such as generalized or focal seizures, which can include loss of consciousness, jerking movements, staring spells, and other significant physical and cognitive disruptions[2][4][5].\n- **Frequency and Triggers**: Your experiences are triggered by specific mental activities, such as reminiscing about old objects or photos, and occur relatively infrequently (about once a week or month). Epileptic seizures can occur at any time, often without a specific mental trigger, and can vary widely in frequency.\n- **Duration and Impact**: Your episodes are brief, lasting only a second or so, and while they can be disorienting, they do not seem to cause the prolonged confusion, memory loss, or physical aftermath that is common with epileptic seizures[2][4][5].\n\n### Possible Explanations\n\n- **Memory and Brain Activity**: The brain's attempt to recreate past experiences can indeed trigger unusual sensations. This could be related to the brain's natural processes of memory retrieval and the emotional or sensory associations linked to those memories. It might be a unique response to nostalgia or strong sensory recall rather than an epileptic seizure[4].\n- **Sensory Overload or Stress**: The sudden ringing in your ears and feeling of being \"out of it\" could also be related to sensory overload or a stress response when your brain is intensively engaging with nostalgic memories.\n- **Consultation**: While your doctor may not see this as a significant impairment, it might still be worthwhile to discuss this further with a neurologist to rule out any underlying neurological issues. However, given the specific nature of your experiences, it is less likely to be a form of epilepsy.\n\nIn summary, the characteristics of your episodes do not strongly suggest epilepsy, but consulting a neurologist could provide further clarity and reassurance."

        "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of epilepsy triggered by a head injury in the past, there are several factors to consider before undergoing a stun gun test:\n\n## Risk of Seizures from Stun Gun Use\n- There is evidence suggesting that stun gun use, especially when the electrical discharge passes through the head, can lead to brain-specific complications, including seizures. A case report published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal describes a police officer who experienced seizures after being hit by a Taser in the head[1][2][5].\n\n## Previous Epilepsy History\n- Although it has been over 20 years since you had an epileptic attack, your past history of epilepsy is a significant factor. The use of a stun gun, particularly if the electrical discharge affects the head, could potentially trigger a seizure, especially given that emotional stress and physical exertion are known seizure-precipitating factors[5].\n\n## Manufacturer Warnings\n- Taser International specifically warns against targeting the head with their devices, as this can increase the risk of seizures. They acknowledge that electrical stimuli passing through the head region may heighten this risk[2].\n\n## Potential Long-Term Effects\n- Even if you do not experience an immediate seizure, there is a possibility of other neurological effects. The case report mentioned earlier also notes mild traumatic brain injury and post-concussion syndrome following the Taser shot[1][2].\n\nGiven these considerations, it would be prudent to discuss your medical history and concerns with a healthcare professional before proceeding with the stun gun test. They can provide a more informed assessment of the risks and advice on whether it is safe for you to undergo this test. Additionally, you may want to inform the organization requiring the test about your medical history to see if alternative testing methods can be considered."

        "question": "I am a 23 year old women I was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease and other chronic inflammation about 8 years ago, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy, on top of that I have cysts throughout my body. I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your medical history and current conditions, here are some insights into the connections between inflammation, epilepsy, and the presence of cysts.\n\n## Inflammation and Epilepsy\n\nThere is substantial evidence suggesting a strong link between inflammation and epilepsy. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Brain Inflammation**: Chronic brain inflammation, involving the activation of microglia, astrocytes, and the production of inflammatory mediators, is thought to be a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of seizures and epilepsy. This inflammation can lead to changes in neuronal excitability and enhance seizure-induced neuropathology[1].\n\n2. **Seizure-Induced Inflammation**: Seizure activity itself can induce brain inflammation, and recurrent seizures can perpetuate this chronic inflammation. This process involves the upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, the complement system, and adhesion molecules[1].\n\n3. **Immune System Activation**: The involvement of the immune system, including the activation of peripheral immune cells and the expression of chemokines, can recruit more inflammatory cells into the brain, contributing to the epileptogenic process[1].\n\nGiven your history of Crohn\u2019s disease, which is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic inflammation, it is plausible that systemic inflammation could exacerbate or contribute to the development of epilepsy.\n\n## Cysts and Inflammation\n\nThe presence of cysts throughout your body could be related to inflammation in several ways:\n\n### Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Extraintestinal Manifestations\n\n1. **Crohn\u2019s Disease**: While Crohn\u2019s disease primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, it can have extraintestinal manifestations, including various types of cysts. For instance, ovarian cysts are more common in patients with IBD compared to the general population, although the difference may not always be statistically significant[5].\n\n2. **Systemic Inflammation**: The systemic inflammation associated with Crohn\u2019s disease can lead to a variety of extraintestinal complications, including the formation of cysts in different parts of the body. This is part of the broader spectrum of immune and inflammatory responses seen in IBD[2].\n\n### Specific Types of Cysts\n\n1. **Inflammatory Radicular Cysts**: These cysts, which are not directly related to your condition but illustrate the role of inflammation, form as a result of chronic inflammatory processes, involving the activation of immune cells, the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins, and the proliferation of epithelial cells. Similar mechanisms could be at play in other types of cysts that form in an inflammatory context[3].\n\n## Clinical Implications\n\nGiven the interconnectedness of inflammation in your conditions:\n\n- **Monitoring and Management**: It is crucial to manage your Crohn\u2019s disease effectively to reduce systemic inflammation, which may in turn help in managing your epilepsy and potentially reduce the formation or growth of cysts.\n- **Interdisciplinary Care**: Coordination between your gastroenterologist, neurologist, and other specialists is essential to address the various aspects of your conditions comprehensively.\n- **Targeted Therapies**: Considering the role of inflammation in both epilepsy and cyst formation, therapies targeting inflammatory pathways might be beneficial. This could include anti-inflammatory medications or immunomodulatory treatments[1].\n\nConsulting with your healthcare providers to integrate a holistic approach to managing your chronic inflammation, epilepsy, and cysts could be highly beneficial in improving your overall health and reducing the severity of your symptoms."

        "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, it is crucial to approach the prescription of \"SELENICA-R 40%\" with caution and thorough medical evaluation.\n\n### Background on SELENICA-R 40%\n- SELENICA-R 40% is not explicitly named in common medical databases, but it appears to be a medication with a composition similar to other antiepileptic or anticonvulsant drugs, given the context provided[2].\n\n### Concerns and Considerations\n- **Usage for Epileptics**: This medication is typically used for treating epilepsy, which does not align with your current symptoms of dizziness, motor function issues, joint pain, and speech problems unless these are somehow related to a neurological condition that has not yet been diagnosed.\n- **Potential Side Effects**: Antiepileptic medications like SELENICA-R 40% can have significant side effects, including cognitive impairments, motor disturbances, and other neurological symptoms. Given your existing symptoms, introducing a new medication with such potential side effects could exacerbate your condition[2].\n- **Lack of Diagnostic Fit**: Your symptoms of dizziness, motor function weirdness, joint pain, and speech issues do not clearly match the typical indications for antiepileptic medications. These symptoms suggest a need for a more specific diagnosis, possibly involving neurological, orthopedic, or other specialist evaluations.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation**:\n   - Given the array of symptoms you're experiencing, it's important to rule out other potential causes such as neurological disorders, musculoskeletal issues, or even residual effects from your previous medications.\n   - Continuing to see specialists such as neurologists, orthopedists, and possibly a rheumatologist could help in identifying the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\n2. **Tapering and Withdrawal Symptoms**:\n   - Your transition from Zoloft to Lexapro and then discontinuing Lexapro could be contributing to your current symptoms. The discontinuation of SSRIs like Lexapro can lead to a variety of symptoms, including dizziness, motor function issues, and cognitive disturbances. However, these symptoms typically peak around day 5 and should resolve within a few weeks to a couple of months[1][4].\n\n3. **Current Medication and Supplements**:\n   - The high dose of magnesium (2000mg per day) might be contributing to some of your gastrointestinal or other symptoms. It is essential to discuss this with your doctor to ensure it is not exacerbating your condition.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Consult Multiple Specialists**: Before starting any new medication, especially one as potent as SELENICA-R 40%, it is advisable to consult with multiple specialists to get a comprehensive understanding of your condition.\n- **Rule Out Other Conditions**: Ensure that all possible causes for your symptoms are explored, including pinched nerves, bulged discs, or other neurological conditions.\n- **Medical Supervision**: Any new medication should be started under close medical supervision to monitor for side effects and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n\nGiven the complexity and the potential risks associated with starting a new medication without a clear diagnosis, it is crucial to proceed with caution and seek advice from multiple healthcare professionals."

        "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds. Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "### Can Epilepsy Happen Without a Known Reason?\nYes, epilepsy can occur without an identifiable cause. In about half of the people with epilepsy, there is no known cause for the condition. Even when there is a genetic component, environmental factors often play a significant role. Genetic predisposition can make a person more sensitive to environmental triggers that may lead to seizures, but it does not guarantee the development of epilepsy[1][2][5].\n\n### Family Risk\nHaving a family history of epilepsy can increase your risk, but it does not mean you will definitely develop the condition. Studies have shown that:\n- First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or children) of individuals with epilepsy have a higher risk of developing epilepsy, with a risk that is about 2-5 times that of the general population[3].\n- If your mother's cousin had epilepsy, it suggests there might be a genetic component, but the risk is still relatively low. The risk is more significant for immediate relatives (parents, siblings, or children) rather than more distant relatives like cousins[3].\n\n### Risk to Children of Affected Relatives\nThe children of your mother's cousin are at a slightly higher risk due to the family history, but the overall risk is still manageable. The likelihood of them developing epilepsy depends on various factors, including the specific type of epilepsy and the presence of other genetic or environmental risk factors[2][3].\n\n### Role of Medications\nCertain medications can influence seizure risk, but they are not typically the primary cause of epilepsy. However, some medications can lower the seizure threshold, making it more likely for seizures to occur in individuals who are already predisposed. For example:\n- Medications for depression or anxiety, such as SSRIs like Citalopram, are generally not known to cause epilepsy but may potentially lower the seizure threshold in rare cases. This is more of a concern for individuals who already have a history of seizures or epilepsy[5].\n\n### Lifestyle and Environmental Factors\nLifestyle factors such as smoking, chronic alcohol use, and lack of sleep can increase the risk of seizures in people with epilepsy. However, these factors are more about triggering seizures in those who already have the condition rather than causing epilepsy itself[1][5].\n\nIn summary:\n- You do have a slightly increased risk due to your family history, but it is not extremely high.\n- The risk to your mother's cousin's children is also elevated, but it is still relatively low.\n- While certain medications can affect seizure risk, they are not common causes of epilepsy.\n- Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help reduce the overall risk of developing seizures or epilepsy."

        "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While your experiences with flashing lights and feelings of discomfort are noteworthy, they do not necessarily indicate that you have epilepsy. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Photosensitive Epilepsy\nPhotosensitive epilepsy is a specific type of epilepsy where seizures are triggered by flashing lights or contrasting light and dark patterns. However, it is relatively rare, affecting only about 5% of people with epilepsy, and it is more common in children and young people than in adults[1].\n\n## Normal Reaction to Flashing Lights\nIt is normal for people, whether they have epilepsy or not, to feel disoriented, uncomfortable, or unwell when exposed to flashing lights or certain patterns. This reaction does not necessarily mean you have photosensitive epilepsy or any form of epilepsy[1].\n\n## Self-Testing\nForcing yourself to watch a video designed to test for photosensitive epilepsy is not a reliable or safe method for self-diagnosis. If you suspect you might be sensitive to flashing lights or have any concerns about epilepsy, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional. An electroencephalogram (EEG) test, performed in a controlled medical setting, is the standard way to diagnose photosensitive epilepsy[1].\n\n## Risk Factors\nThere is no evidence to suggest that watching flashing lights or videos can increase your susceptibility to developing epilepsy. Epilepsy is generally caused by underlying brain abnormalities, head injuries, infections, genetic factors, or other specific medical conditions[3][5].\n\n## Next Steps\nIf you continue to experience discomfort or other unusual symptoms when exposed to flashing lights, it would be wise to consult a healthcare provider or a neurologist. They can assess your symptoms and perform the necessary tests to determine if there is any underlying condition that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn summary, while your reactions to flashing lights are uncomfortable, they do not necessarily indicate epilepsy. A professional medical evaluation is the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms."

        "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the suggestions from your doctor, there are several points to consider regarding the possibility of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and the limitations of diagnostic tests.\n\n## Symptoms of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy\nYour described symptoms, such as:\n- Dizziness\n- Sharp pain in the corner of the eye\n- Zoned out feeling\n- Random memories and visions, including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n- Blurred vision\n- Slurred speech\n- Hot flushes\n- Nausea-like feeling\n\nare consistent with those associated with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. TLE often presents with auras or warning symptoms, followed by seizures that can include motor disturbances, sensory symptoms, and autonomic symptoms, all of which align with your experiences[1][4][5].\n\n## Diagnostic Limitations\nWhile an MRI can be useful in identifying structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, vascular malformations, or mesial temporal sclerosis, it may not always detect the specific areas causing seizures in TLE. Here are some reasons why the MRI might not have shown anything:\n- **Functional vs. Structural:** TLE can result from functional disturbances rather than visible structural abnormalities. In such cases, an MRI might appear normal[5].\n- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** A more precise diagnosis often requires EEG or video-EEG monitoring to capture the electrical activity of the brain during a seizure. This can help identify the specific area of the brain where the seizures are originating[2][5].\n\n## Need for Further Evaluation\nGiven the recurrence and severity of your episodes, it is prudent to seek further evaluation. Here are some steps you might consider:\n- **EEG or Video-EEG Monitoring:** Request your doctor to refer you for an EEG or video-EEG to capture the electrical activity during one of your episodes.\n- **Neuropsychological Testing:** This can help assess any cognitive or behavioral changes that might be associated with TLE[2][5].\n- **Specialized Care:** Consulting a neurologist or an epileptologist can provide a more detailed evaluation and management plan.\n\n## Concerns and Next Steps\nYes, you should be concerned about the frequency and nature of your episodes, especially since they are recurring and impacting your daily life. Given that you have experienced multiple episodes in one day, it would be wise to follow up with your doctor or seek a specialist to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis of TLE or another condition.\n\nIn summary, while the MRI was clear, the symptoms you are describing are highly suggestive of TLE, and further specialized diagnostic testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

        "question": "My current age is 31. Height: 5'7\" Weight: 140 lbs. I have been having convulsive seizures almost every month since I turned 26. These seizures almost exclusively occur within an hour of waking up. I walk around the house for up to half an hour, burning up. Could stress be a trigger for these episodes? I also have times where I get euphoric and nauseous, but they never last very long.Basically, what I want to know is, what is going on in my head. Is this temporal lobe epilepsy? Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the frequency of your seizures, it is crucial to consult a neurologist for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. Here are some points to consider based on the information you provided:\n\n## Nature of Seizures\n- Your seizures occur almost exclusively within an hour of waking up, and you experience convulsive seizures almost every month since you were 26. This timing and frequency suggest a pattern that needs to be investigated further.\n- The fact that you experience euphoric and nauseous feelings, though brief, could be indicative of certain types of seizures.\n\n## Possible Types of Seizures\n\n### Focal Seizures\n- Your symptoms, such as walking around the house for up to half an hour while feeling like you are \"burning up,\" could be indicative of focal seizures. Focal seizures start in one part of the brain and can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the brain region involved[2][3].\n\n### Temporal Lobe Epilepsy\n- Some of your symptoms, such as euphoric feelings, nausea, and possibly hallucinations or unusual sensations, can be associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe seizures often include auras or warning symptoms like abnormal sensations, hallucinations, or vivid d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and can lead to motor disturbances, sensory symptoms, or autonomic symptoms[1][4].\n\n### Focal to Bilateral Tonic-Clonic Seizures\n- Since your seizures can be convulsive and occur frequently, they might be focal seizures that spread to become focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. These seizures start in one part of the brain but can spread to involve both hemispheres of the brain, leading to tonic and clonic features[2][5].\n\n## Triggers and Other Factors\n\n- **Stress**: While stress can be a trigger for seizures, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of your recurring seizures. Other underlying conditions or structural issues in the brain are more likely to be the primary cause[3].\n\n## Medication and Next Steps\n\n- **Current Medication**: Since Keppra (levetiracetam) is not working for you, your neurologist may need to consider other anticonvulsant medications. There are various options available, and the choice will depend on the specific type of epilepsy or seizure disorder you are diagnosed with.\n- **Further Diagnosis**: To determine the exact type of epilepsy or seizure disorder, you may need to undergo further diagnostic tests such as:\n  - EEG (electroencephalogram) to record your brain's electrical activity.\n  - MRI or CT scans to look for any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n  - Video-EEG monitoring to capture seizures and their effects in real-time.\n\nIt is essential to work closely with a neurologist to get a precise diagnosis and to explore other treatment options, including different medications, dietary changes, nerve stimulation, or even surgery if necessary[1][3]."

        "question": "25 Male, 186 CM, 93 KG.I was happy that Johnson vaccine finally arrived at my country. However I started reading about it, there were some concerns reported last month that it may cause Neurological disorder and muscle paralysis.So as a someone who is treating from mild epilepsy (occurred to me only 4 times and usually my diagnosis are good) for about 6 years , should I be concerned about it ? also if I have the chance to take AstraZeneca should I do it ?Would appreciate your response because I can't reach to my Dr. at the moment",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of mild epilepsy and the concerns you have about neurological side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, here are some points to consider:\n\n## Neurological Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccines\n\n### Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) Vaccine\n- There have been rare reports of neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) following the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Symptoms of GBS typically begin within 42 days after vaccination and include muscle weakness, tingling sensations, and difficulties with walking or facial movements[4].\n- Other rare neurological complications include blood clots with low platelet levels, which can lead to symptoms like severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, and easy bruising[4].\n\n### AstraZeneca Vaccine\n- This vaccine has also been associated with rare neurological side effects, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (VST), transverse myelitis, and GBS. VST is particularly noted with vector-based vaccines like AstraZeneca's[1][2].\n- Headache is a common side effect, but in some cases, it can be a sign of a more serious condition like VST[1].\n\n## Impact on Epilepsy\n- Studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccines, in general, do not significantly increase the risk of seizures in people with epilepsy. A cross-sectional study found no significant difference in the number of seizures before, between, or after vaccination[3].\n- However, it is crucial to note that while the overall risk is low, there have been reports of seizures, though these are often associated with other conditions like VST rather than a direct effect of the vaccine[2].\n\n## Recommendations\n- Given your mild epilepsy and the rare but potential neurological side effects, it is important to weigh the risks against the benefits of vaccination.\n- Both the Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines have rare but serious neurological side effects, so neither can be definitively recommended over the other solely based on neurological risk.\n- If you have the option, consulting with your healthcare provider or a neurologist would be ideal to make an informed decision tailored to your specific health situation.\n- In general, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19 often outweigh the risks of these rare side effects[2][3].\n\n## Immediate Action\n- Since you cannot reach your doctor immediately, consider contacting a healthcare hotline or a medical professional for an urgent consultation to discuss your specific situation.\n- If you do decide to get vaccinated, ensure that you are monitored for any adverse reactions and report any unusual symptoms promptly."

        "question": "I am 14, Male I was diagnosed with Photosensitive Epilepsy at a young age if that helps.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your diagnosis of photosensitive epilepsy at a young age, here are some key points and considerations relevant to your condition:\n\n## Age and Gender\nPhotosensitive epilepsy commonly affects individuals between the ages of 8 and 20, with the highest incidence around 12-13 years old. It is more prevalent in females than males, but it can affect males as well[2][3][5].\n\n## Triggers\nPhotosensitive seizures are triggered by specific visual stimuli, including:\n- Flickering or flashing lights, particularly at frequencies of 15-20 flashes per second.\n- High-contrast lighting patterns, such as those found in music videos, computer-generated images, or rapid scene changes.\n- Natural light sources like sunlight reflecting off water or passing through tree leaves.\n- Close viewing of striped patterns or other visual stimuli[2][5].\n\n## Types of Seizures\nPhotosensitive epilepsy can lead to various types of seizures, including:\n- Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures\n- Absence seizures\n- Myoclonic seizures\n- Simple or complex partial seizures[2][5].\n\n## Diagnosis\nDiagnosis is typically confirmed through an electroencephalogram (EEG) test, where the patient is exposed to flashing lights to observe changes in brainwave patterns[5].\n\n## Treatment and Prevention\nTreatment often involves a combination of:\n- **Medication:** Sodium valproate (valproic acid) is commonly recommended for controlling photosensitive seizures[2][5].\n- **Avoiding Triggers:** Practical measures such as keeping a safe distance from screens, using anti-glare filters, lowering screen brightness and contrast, and avoiding screen time when tired or stressed[5].\n- **Special Glasses:** Wearing glasses with dark or filtered lenses, such as the 'Z1 lens', can help reduce the risk of seizures by filtering out red light[5].\n\n## Long-term Considerations\nWhile some people may experience a reduction in photosensitivity with age, this is not universally true, especially for those with a family history of photosensitive epilepsy. Studies suggest that photosensitivity can persist beyond adolescence[4].\n\n## Lifestyle Adjustments\nTo manage your condition effectively:\n- Inform others about your condition, especially when attending events that may include strobing lights.\n- Take regular breaks when using screens and ensure the room is well-lit.\n- Avoid triggers such as music videos or high-tech promotional materials with quick-cut editing.\n- Use protective measures like covering one eye or turning away from potential triggers if you encounter them unexpectedly[2][5].\n\nBy being aware of these factors and taking the necessary precautions, you can better manage your photosensitive epilepsy and reduce the risk of seizures."

Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don\u2019t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It\u2019s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit! All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "For individuals with epilepsy, the relationship between alcohol consumption and seizure risk is complex and highly individualized. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Increased Risk of Seizures\n- Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with a significantly increased risk of seizures. Studies indicate that drinking large amounts of alcohol, particularly abruptly stopping or reducing consumption, can lead to withdrawal seizures and even increase the risk of developing epilepsy[3][5].\n- There is a substantial increase in seizure risk with higher alcohol intake; for example, consuming 200 grams or more of alcohol per day can increase the risk of seizures by 15- to 20-fold[5].\n\n## Impact on Seizure Threshold\n- Alcohol can lower the seizure threshold during withdrawal, making seizures more likely after cessation of drinking. This typically occurs within 6-48 hours after stopping alcohol consumption[1][3].\n\n## Interaction with Medications\n- Alcohol can interact with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in ways that may reduce their effectiveness or increase the risk of adverse effects. For instance, alcohol can affect the absorption and blood serum levels of medications like carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin[5].\n\n## Personal Risk Factors\n- Your history of nocturnal epilepsy and use of medications like clobazam and tegratol suggest that you should be cautious with alcohol consumption. While some people may seem to tolerate alcohol without immediate adverse effects, the long-term risks and potential for increased seizure frequency or severity are significant[3][4].\n\n## Luck vs. Tolerance\n- It is unlikely that you are one of the rare individuals who can drink heavily without increased risk. More likely, you have been fortunate so far, but this does not guarantee future safety. Continued heavy drinking could eventually lead to seizures or other complications[1][3][5].\n\n## Recommendations\n- Given your epilepsy and the known risks associated with alcohol consumption, it is advisable to follow your doctor's original recommendation to limit your alcohol intake to no more than 2 standard drinks in one night. This approach minimizes the risk of seizures and interactions with your medications.\n- Avoid binge drinking and chronic high consumption, as these behaviors can significantly increase your risk of seizures and other health issues[3][5].\n\nIn summary, while you may feel fine now, the risks associated with heavy alcohol consumption in individuals with epilepsy are well-documented, and it is prudent to adhere to the cautious advice provided by your healthcare provider."

Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Individuals with epilepsy generally should not use iontophoresis as a treatment for excessive sweating due to several contraindications.\n\n- Iontophoresis is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy or a history of seizures. This is because the electrical current used in the treatment could potentially trigger a seizure[4].\n\n- The use of iontophoresis, especially with certain solutions like glycopyrrolate, involves precautions that include avoiding the treatment in individuals with a history of seizures to minimize the risk of adverse reactions[4].\n\nGiven these contraindications, it is advisable for someone with epilepsy to consult their healthcare provider to discuss alternative treatments for hyperhidrosis that are safer and more suitable for their condition."

        "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",

        "answer": "Epilepsy and seizures can have several long-term implications for brain health, although the extent of these effects can vary significantly from person to person.\n\n## Long-Term Effects of Seizures\n\n- Uncontrolled seizures, particularly those that are frequent or severe, can lead to cognitive impairments. These may include losses in visual memory, attention, problem-solving, and perception. However, the relationship between seizures and cognitive function is complex and can be influenced by the underlying condition causing the seizures[1][3][5.).\n\n## Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Impacts\n\n- People with treatment-resistant epilepsy, especially those whose seizures began in early childhood, are at a higher risk of cognitive impairment. This impairment may be related to the underlying conditions associated with the epilepsy rather than the epilepsy itself[3].\n\n## Status Epilepticus and SUDEP\n\n- Status epilepticus, a condition where a person has an abnormally prolonged seizure or multiple seizures without fully regaining consciousness between them, can lead to permanent brain damage and increased risk of death. This condition is particularly hazardous and requires immediate medical attention[1][3][5].\n\n## General Brain Health and Seizures\n\n- While seizures themselves are symptoms of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, frequent or severe seizures can contribute to brain damage over time. Better control of seizures is associated with better long-term brain health, suggesting that effective management of seizures may reduce the risk of cognitive damage[1].\n\n## Specific Risks Associated with Epilepsy\n\n- Epilepsy is linked with an increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), particularly in individuals with poorly controlled seizures. SUDEP is thought to be related to abnormal brain activity affecting heart and respiratory functions[3][5].\n\n## Preventive Measures\n\n- To minimize the risks associated with epilepsy and seizures, it is crucial to adhere strictly to medication regimens, maintain a healthy lifestyle, avoid known seizure triggers (such as lack of sleep, stress, and certain medications), and follow the advice of healthcare providers. Keeping a detailed seizure journal can also help in managing the condition effectively[5].\n\nIn your case, since you have a well-managed epilepsy condition with only occasional part-seizures and rare full-blown seizures, the risks of long-term brain damage may be lower compared to those with more frequent or uncontrolled seizures. However, it is important to continue following your treatment plan and avoiding triggers to the best of your ability.\n\nGiven your recent experience with a more severe seizure, it would be beneficial to discuss the following with your doctor when you next meet:\n- The specifics of your seizure and any potential changes in your treatment plan.\n- Strategies to further minimize the risk of future seizures.\n- Any additional monitoring or diagnostic tests that might be necessary to ensure your epilepsy is optimally managed.\n\nDespite the challenges in your recent interactions with your doctor, it is essential to communicate your concerns and questions effectively to ensure you receive the best possible care for your condition."

        "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing could be indicative of several possibilities, and it's important to distinguish between normal behaviors and potential signs of absence seizures.\n\n### Symptoms of Absence Seizures\nAbsence seizures, also known as petit mal seizures, are characterized by:\n- A sudden stop in activity or talking\n- Blankly staring ahead without being aware of the surroundings\n- Not responding to external stimuli\n- Repeated movements such as lip-smacking, eyelid fluttering, or hand fumbling\n- Returning to normal activity immediately after the seizure ends[1][2][5].\n\n### Comparing Your Symptoms\n- **Staring Spells**: If you find yourself frequently entering staring spells that last between 5 to 30 seconds, and during which you are not responsive, this could be a sign of absence seizures.\n- **Lack of Attention**: While it's common for people to occasionally zone out or not pay attention, the frequency and nature of your episodes (e.g., staring, not responding) might suggest something more than just lack of attention.\n- **Recalling Conversations**: If you recall what was being said after the episode, but were unresponsive during it, this aligns with the characteristic of absence seizures where individuals are unaware during the seizure but return to normal immediately after.\n\n### Diagnostic Considerations\n- **Age and History**: It is less common for absence seizures to first appear in adulthood, but it is not impossible. Absence seizures typically start in childhood or adolescence, but new-onset cases in adults can occur[1][2][5].\n- **Sleep Deprived EEG**: The sleep deprived EEG you are scheduled for is a sensitive test that can help reveal abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which is indicative of seizures. This test can be particularly useful if you have been experiencing these episodes, especially if they are related to sleep or drowsiness[3].\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Medical Evaluation**: It is crucial to discuss your symptoms in detail with your healthcare provider. They will likely perform a thorough examination, including an EEG, and possibly other tests like CT or MRI scans to rule out other conditions.\n- **Observation and Recording**: If possible, have someone observe and record one of these episodes to provide more detailed information to your healthcare provider. This can help in making an accurate diagnosis.\n\n### Frequency of Late Diagnosis\nWhile it is less common for epilepsy to be diagnosed for the first time in adulthood, especially if there have been no previous serious seizures, it is not unheard of. Some forms of epilepsy can have mild symptoms that are easily overlooked or misinterpreted until they become more frequent or severe.\n\nIn summary, given the nature of your symptoms and the upcoming sleep deprived EEG, it is wise to consult with your healthcare provider to determine whether these episodes are indicative of absence seizures or another condition. The diagnostic tests and your healthcare provider's evaluation will provide more clarity on your situation."

        "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the results from your blood tests, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Causes of Folate and Iron Deficiencies\n\n### Folate Deficiency\n- Despite your efforts to maintain a balanced diet, folate deficiency can still occur due to various reasons. Here are a few possibilities:\n  - **Malabsorption**: Certain conditions or medications can affect the body's ability to absorb folate. Although you mentioned your epilepsy is controlled by Keppra (levetiracetam), which is less likely to interfere with folate absorption compared to other anticonvulsants, it's still worth discussing with your doctor[1][5].\n  - **Increased Demand**: Pregnancy, lactation, or increased metabolic needs can lead to a higher demand for folate, which may not be met by your current diet. However, since you didn't mention being pregnant or lactating, this is less likely[1].\n  - **Dietary Intake**: Although you consume a variety of vegetables, the bioavailability of folate from these sources can vary. Additionally, cooking and food processing can reduce folate content[1].\n\n### Iron Deficiency\n- **Malabsorption**: Similar to folate, certain medications or conditions can impair iron absorption. Since Keppra is not typically known to affect iron levels, other factors might be at play.\n- **Dietary Intake**: While you consume meat regularly, which is a good source of iron, the type of iron in plant-based foods (non-heme iron) is not as easily absorbed as the heme iron found in meat. However, consuming vitamin C-rich foods (like the fruits you mentioned) can enhance non-heme iron absorption. Still, a deficiency could occur if your overall intake is not sufficient or if there is an increased demand[1][5\u093e\u0964\n\n## Impact on Epilepsy\n- **Medications and Nutrient Deficiencies**: It's crucial to discuss your nutrient deficiencies with your neurologist, especially since anticonvulsants can sometimes interact with nutrient levels. Although Keppra is generally not implicated in folate or iron deficiencies, monitoring and adjusting treatment plans if necessary is important[1][5].\n- **General Health**: Ensuring you address these deficiencies can help in maintaining overall health, which is beneficial for managing epilepsy. Nutrient deficiencies can exacerbate fatigue and other symptoms, potentially impacting your quality of life and seizure control.\n\n## Symptoms and Next Steps\n- Your symptoms of tiredness, extreme thirst, and pallor are consistent with both folate and iron deficiencies. The thirst could be related to other underlying issues, but addressing the nutrient deficiencies is a critical first step[1][3][4].\n- Given your test results, your GP will likely recommend folate and iron supplements to correct the deficiencies. It is important to follow up with both your GP and neurologist to ensure these supplements do not interact with your epilepsy medication and to monitor any changes in your condition.\n\nBy addressing these deficiencies and ensuring you have a balanced diet that meets your nutritional needs, you can help alleviate your symptoms and maintain better overall health."

        "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your concerns and the recent diagnosis of your son, here are some detailed answers to your questions:\n\n## Abnormal EEG After the Event\nAn abnormal EEG hours after a seizure is not uncommon, especially if the seizure was recent. The EEG can show abnormal electrical activity in the brain even after the seizure has ended, particularly in the postictal period. This does not necessarily mean that your son always has an abnormal EEG; it could be a reflection of the recent seizure activity. However, repeated EEGs over time will help determine if the abnormality is persistent or if it was a transient finding[1][5].\n\n## Impact on Growth and Mental Development\nAn abnormal EEG itself does not directly affect growth or mental development. However, the underlying condition causing the seizures (if it is epilepsy) could potentially impact these areas if not managed properly. For instance, certain types of epilepsy or frequent seizures can affect cognitive and developmental outcomes. The use of antiepileptic drugs like Depakote can also have various side effects, some of which might influence growth and development, but these are generally monitored by healthcare providers[1][5].\n\n## Underlying Cause and MRI\nWhile the initial evaluation, including a CT scan, did not reveal any masses or lesions, an MRI might still be considered to rule out structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing the seizures. However, the decision to perform an MRI is typically made by the neurologist based on the clinical presentation and the initial findings. If the EEG suggests a primary generalized epilepsy, which often does not have a structural cause, the need for an MRI might be less pressing. Still, discussing this further with the neurologist is advisable to ensure all potential causes are considered[1][4].\n\n## Quality of Life on Depakote\nDepakote (divalproex sodium) can have significant side effects, as you've read. Common concerns include:\n- **Liver Toxicity:** This is a serious side effect, especially in children under two years old, but it can occur at any age. Regular monitoring of liver function is essential[2][3].\n- **Behavior Changes:** Mood changes, such as depression, anxiety, or irritability, can occur.\n- **Hair Loss:** This is another potential side effect.\n- **Other Side Effects:** These can include dizziness, tremors, and various gastrointestinal issues.\n\nRealistically, while many children can tolerate Depakote with minimal side effects, it's crucial to monitor your son closely and report any concerns to his healthcare provider. Adjustments in medication or additional monitoring may be necessary.\n\n## Alternative Treatments\nCBD (cannabidiol) and other alternative treatments are not typically recommended as the first line of treatment for epilepsy, especially for primary generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures. These conditions often require conventional antiepileptic drugs to control seizures effectively. However, in some cases where traditional treatments are not effective or have severe side effects, alternative treatments may be considered under the guidance of a neurologist. It's important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider rather than making changes on your own[4].\n\n## Second or Third Opinion\nGiven the complexity of epilepsy and the potential side effects of medications, seeking a second or third opinion is a reasonable and often recommended approach. This can help ensure that the diagnosis is accurate and that the treatment plan is optimal for your son. Sharing the initial EEG and other diagnostic results with other neurologists can be very helpful in getting a more comprehensive view of his condition.\n\nTaking your son to a specialized epilepsy center, such as one accredited by the National Association of Epilepsy Centers, can also provide access to advanced diagnostic tools and a team of experts in pediatric epilepsy[4]."

        "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you described could be indicative of a seizure, particularly given your history of epilepsy. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Aura Symptoms\n- You mentioned a \"deja vu\" feeling, which is a common symptom of a seizure aura. Auras can include sensations such as deja vu, jamais vu, odd smells, tastes, visual disturbances, and other sensory changes[1][3][5].\n\n## Ictal Phase Symptoms\n- During the incident, you experienced an inability to move, open your eyes, or speak for about 20 seconds, along with amplified sound and a vibrating sensation in your skin and muscles. These could be signs of the ictal phase of a seizure, although they do not include the typical convulsions or loss of consciousness associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures[1][3][5].\n\n## Post-Ictal Phase Symptoms\n- After the episode, you felt very exhausted, groggy, and mentally down, which are common symptoms of the post-ictal phase following a seizure. This phase involves recovery and can include confusion, fatigue, headache, and emotional changes[1][3].\n\n## Triggering Factors\n- The combination of Adderall, espresso, and alcohol could potentially trigger a seizure, especially in someone with a history of epilepsy. These substances can alter brain chemistry and may lower the seizure threshold[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is possible that you experienced a seizure, although the specific nature of it (e.g., focal or generalized) would need to be determined by a medical professional. Here are some steps you should take:\n\n1. **Consult Your Doctor**: It is crucial to discuss this incident with your neurologist or primary care physician, especially given your history of epilepsy and the potential triggers involved.\n2. **Review Medication and Lifestyle**: Your doctor may need to adjust your medications or advise on lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of future seizures.\n3. **Monitoring**: You may need to be monitored for any further seizure activity to determine the best course of treatment.\n\nDo not hesitate to seek medical advice promptly to ensure your safety and to manage any ongoing or potential seizure activity."

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your recent car accident and seizure, here are some key points and considerations that might help you understand your situation and the steps you should take:\n\n## Driving Restrictions\nSince you had a seizure while driving, you are subject to driving restrictions. In most jurisdictions, if you have had a seizure that affected your consciousness, you must be seizure-free for a certain period, typically 12 months, before you can drive again[1][3][5').\n- You will need to notify the relevant driving authority (e.g., DVLA in the UK, DMV in the US) about your seizure and follow their guidelines.\n\n## Medical Evaluation\nIt is crucial to see a neurologist as soon as possible to get a definitive diagnosis and to manage your epilepsy effectively. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is what you suspect, but a neurologist's evaluation is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and to adjust your treatment plan if needed.\n\n## Current Medication\nYou have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) and have not had a seizure since October, which is a positive sign. However, it is important to continue under medical supervision to ensure the medication is effective and to monitor any side effects or changes in your condition.\n\n## Accident-Related Injuries\nGiven the pain you are experiencing in your left side and lower rib cage area, it is likely that you sustained injuries from the accident, such as contusions or internal bruising. Here are some considerations:\n- **Pleurisy or Lung Injury**: The constant pressure around your heart and left lung could indicate a lung injury or pleurisy, which is inflammation of the pleura, the two layers of tissue that surround the lungs. This needs medical attention to rule out any serious conditions.\n- **Medical Evaluation**: Despite the lack of visible swelling or redness, it is essential to get a proper medical evaluation, including an X-ray or other imaging tests, to assess any internal injuries.\n- **Current Treatment**: The anti-inflammatory steroids and pain relief measures prescribed by your doctor are a good starting point, but further diagnostic tests are necessary to ensure there are no underlying serious conditions.\n\n## Immediate Actions\n- **Seek Emergency Care if Necessary**: If the pain worsens or you experience any symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness, you should seek immediate emergency care.\n- **Follow-Up Care**: Once you can afford it, schedule an appointment with a neurologist to get a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss your driving status.\n\n## General Safety and Support\n- **Notify Insurance and Employer**: Inform your motor insurance company and employer about your seizure, as this can affect your driving and work arrangements[2].\n- **Support Resources**: There are support resources available for people with epilepsy, including help with travel costs and employment accommodations[2].\n\nGiven your current financial constraints, it may be helpful to explore local health clinics or non-profit organizations that offer medical services at reduced costs or on a sliding scale. Additionally, reaching out to epilepsy support groups or helplines can provide valuable advice and resources."

I\u2019m 16 years old and I just want this gone. I\u2019m so sick and tired of the fear.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Considering your situation with frontal lobe nocturnal tonic-clonic epilepsy, here are some points to help you make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the suggested tests and potential surgery:\n\n## Efficacy of Surgery\n- For patients with drug-resistant frontal lobe epilepsy, surgical treatment can be highly effective. Studies have shown that surgical resection can lead to significant reductions in seizure frequency, with some patients achieving complete seizure freedom. For instance, a study mentioned that patients with drug-resistant NFLE had high seizure-freedom rates after surgical treatment, up to 75% in some cases[1][4].\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n- The tests your doctor suggested (PET scan, CT scan, and MRI) are crucial for accurately localizing the seizure focus and understanding the anatomy of your brain. These tests, especially the MRI, can help identify any anatomical abnormalities, such as focal cortical dysplasia, which is common in frontal lobe epilepsy[1][4].\n\n## Safety and Monitoring\n- While it is true that you may need to have a seizure during these diagnostic tests, medical professionals take extensive precautions to ensure your safety. They are trained to recognize and manage seizures, and the tests are typically conducted in a controlled environment where interventions can be quickly implemented if necessary[1][4].\n\n## Risks and Benefits\n- The fear of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is understandable, but it is important to weigh this against the potential benefits of reducing or eliminating your seizures. Surgery can significantly improve the quality of life for those with drug-resistant epilepsy, reducing the frequency and severity of seizures and associated risks like SUDEP[1][5].\n\n## Current Treatment Limitations\n- If you are already on multiple medications (Onfi, Lamictal XR, etc.) and still experiencing significant seizure activity, it may indicate that your current treatment regimen is not fully effective. Surgery could offer a more definitive solution to managing your epilepsy[1][3][4].\n\n## Age and Long-term Impact\n- At 16, you are at a stage where the impact of ongoing seizures could be significant on your education, social life, and future opportunities. Successful surgical treatment could alleviate many of these concerns and improve your long-term outlook[1][4].\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the potential benefits and the thorough pre-surgical evaluation process, it is generally recommended to proceed with the diagnostic tests. These tests will help determine whether you are a good candidate for surgical intervention, which could significantly improve your quality of life.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to maintain open communication with your healthcare team about your fears and concerns. They can provide additional reassurance and support throughout the process, ensuring that you are comfortable with the decisions being made."

I have an appointment with my doctor coming up soon, and was hoping to get some information so I could have some good questions to ask regarding treatment, including DBS. Any other recommendations would be great as well. Thank you in advance for your help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your conditions of temporal lobe epilepsy and the recent onset of generalized dystonia, deep brain stimulation (DBS) could be a potential treatment option to consider. Here are some key points and questions you might want to discuss with your doctor:\n\n## Deep Brain Stimulation for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy\n\n1. **Efficacy**: Studies have shown that DBS can be effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. For example, DBS targeting the medial temporal lobe structures has resulted in significant reductions in seizure frequency, with some patients achieving seizure freedom or a reduction of more than 90% in seizure frequency[1][3][5].\n\n2. **Targets**: The hippocampus, subiculum, and parahippocampal cortex are common targets for DBS in treating temporal lobe epilepsy. The choice of target may depend on the specific location of the seizure onset zone and the presence of hippocampal sclerosis[3][5].\n\n3. **Safety**: DBS is generally well-tolerated, though there can be rare complications such as asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhages or micro-lesions. No significant neuropsychological deterioration has been reported in most studies[1][3][5].\n\n## Deep Brain Stimulation for Dystonia\n\n1. **Efficacy**: DBS is an established treatment for medication-refractory dystonia, particularly targeting the internal globus pallidus (GPi). It can significantly improve symptoms of dystonia, although the response may vary depending on the type of dystonia (primary vs. secondary)[2][4].\n\n2. **Targets**: The GPi is the most common target for DBS in dystonia, but other targets such as the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are also being explored[2][4].\n\n3. **Mechanism**: The exact mechanism of DBS in dystonia is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve modulation of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network, preventing the transmission of pathologic neural activity[4].\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Doctor\n\n- **Eligibility**: Am I a suitable candidate for DBS given my specific conditions of temporal lobe epilepsy and generalized dystonia?\n- **Targets and Settings**: Which brain regions would be targeted for DBS in my case, and what stimulation parameters would be used?\n- **Risks and Side Effects**: What are the potential risks and side effects of DBS, and how common are they?\n- **Long-Term Outcomes**: What are the long-term outcomes for patients with conditions similar to mine who have undergone DBS?\n- **Combination Therapy**: Since I have both epilepsy and dystonia, can DBS effectively manage both conditions simultaneously, or would separate procedures be necessary?\n- **Alternative Treatments**: Are there other treatment options that should be considered before proceeding with DBS?\n- **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: What kind of monitoring and follow-up care would be required after the DBS procedure?\n\n## Additional Recommendations\n\n- **Multidisciplinary Team**: Ensure that your care is managed by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neurologists, and other specialists to optimize the outcome of DBS[4].\n- **Clinical Trials**: Ask if there are any ongoing clinical trials for DBS in your conditions that you might be eligible for.\n- **Adjustments in Current Medications**: Discuss whether any adjustments to your current medications (Keppra, Prozac) would be necessary if you undergo DBS.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can have a more informed discussion with your doctor and make an educated decision about whether DBS is the right treatment option for you."

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are some insights and answers to your questions:\n\n## Was her head to head movement seizure activity?\n\nThe description of your girlfriend being found unresponsive with side-to-side head movements, especially in the context of subsequent uncontrolled seizures and ICU admission, suggests that these movements were likely part of seizure activity. This is consistent with the symptoms of status epilepticus, particularly the convulsive type, which can include various physical manifestations such as jerking, twitching, or other abnormal movements[1][3][4].\n\n## What are your thoughts on what she had?\n\nGiven the details:\n- The high fever lasting about a week could have been a triggering factor for the seizures.\n- The presence of uncontrolled seizures with no recovery between episodes is a clear indication of status epilepticus.\n- The longest seizure lasting 8.5 minutes further confirms this diagnosis.\n- The abnormal EEG showing seizure activity originating from the left temporal lobe supports the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is consistent with her current seizure symptoms[1][3][4].\n\n## Current Medication and Seizure Activity\n\n### Current Medications\nShe is currently on:\n- Phenytoin 300mg\n- Levetiracetam (Keppra) 2500mg\n- Sodium Valproate 2400mg\n\nThese medications are commonly used in the management of seizures and status epilepticus. Phenytoin, levetiracetam, and sodium valproate are all part of the standard treatment protocols for controlling seizures[2][3][4].\n\n### Current Seizure Activity\nHer current seizures are described as:\n- Not tonic-clonic, but with conscious awareness\n- Involving head, mouth, and eyes similar to tonic-clonic seizures\n- Lasting 30 seconds to 1 minute, occurring about 2 times a week, and mostly nocturnal\n\nThese seizures suggest she is experiencing focal seizures, likely originating from the left temporal lobe, as indicated by her EEG results. The fact that she remains conscious during these seizures points towards focal aware seizures, which are common in TLE[1][3][4].\n\n### Introduction of Vimpat (Lacosamide)\nIntroducing Vimpat (lacosamide) could be a reasonable step, as it is another antiepileptic drug that can be effective in controlling focal seizures. However, the decision to add or adjust medications should be made in consultation with her neurologist to ensure the best possible seizure control and minimize potential side effects[3][5].\n\n## General Thoughts\n\n- The initial episode of status epilepticus and subsequent hospitalizations indicate a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that requires diligent medical management.\n- The use of multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is common in managing complex seizure disorders.\n- Regular monitoring of her condition, including EEGs and clinical assessments, is crucial to adjust her treatment plan as needed.\n- The lack of evidence for autoimmune encephalitis from the spinal taps and the unremarkable MRI suggest that the focus should remain on managing her epilepsy with AEDs and other supportive measures.\n\nIt is essential to continue working closely with her healthcare team to optimize her medication regimen and manage any side effects or complications that may arise."

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your experiences and the symptoms you described, it is indeed possible that you might be experiencing seizures, and it is important to consult a medical professional for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n### Key Points to Consider\n\n#### Seizure Phases\nYou mentioned experiencing the aura, ictal, and post-ictal phases of a seizure, which aligns with the typical stages of a seizure:\n- **Aura**: Early symptoms that can include sensations like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, numbness, or visual changes. In your case, you felt an aura before both seizures[2][5].\n- **Ictal**: The active phase of the seizure, characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can cause loss of awareness, muscle control issues, and other symptoms. You described losing consciousness and experiencing involuntary movements[2][5].\n- **Post-ictal**: The recovery phase, where you might feel confused, tired, and experience other after-effects. Your symptoms such as confusion, inability to speak clearly, and strong spiritual connections post-seizure fit this phase[2][5].\n\n#### Triggering Events\nYour seizures were triggered by physical events (being hit by a baseball and the pain from an ear piercing), which can sometimes initiate seizures in people with certain types of epilepsy.\n\n#### Diagnosis\nTo be diagnosed with epilepsy, it typically requires having at least two unprovoked seizures, or one unprovoked seizure with a high risk of further seizures. Since you have experienced two seizures years apart, it is reasonable to seek medical evaluation[4].\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: It is crucial to discuss your symptoms and history with a neurologist or a healthcare provider who specializes in epilepsy. They will likely perform various tests, including:\n   - **EEG (Electroencephalogram)**: To measure the electrical activity of your brain and check for any abnormal patterns.\n   - **Imaging Tests**: Such as MRI or CT scans to check for any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n   - **Medical History**: A thorough review of your medical history to identify any potential triggers or underlying conditions[4].\n\n2. **Understanding the Implications**: If you are diagnosed with epilepsy, the implications can vary depending on the type and severity of your seizures. You may need to:\n   - **Start Medication**: To control the frequency and severity of seizures.\n   - **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Such as avoiding certain triggers, getting regular sleep, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n   - **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider to adjust treatment plans as needed.\n\n3. **Safety Precautions**: Given your history, it might be wise to take precautions to minimize the risk of injury during a seizure. Informing friends, family, and colleagues about your condition can also be helpful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYour symptoms and the pattern of your experiences suggest that seeking a medical evaluation is a prudent step. It will help determine whether you have a mild case of epilepsy or another condition that needs attention. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve the management of seizures and reduce the risk of future complications."

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When considering the interaction between your current epilepsy medications (Depakote and Keppra) and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), several points are important to note:\n\n### Depakote (Divalproex Sodium) and HRT\n- Depakote is not listed among the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that interact with HRT in a way that would significantly alter the levels of the hormones in HRT. However, it is crucial to monitor your seizure frequency and adjust your medication as needed because HRT can potentially affect seizure control.\n- There is no direct evidence suggesting that Depakote levels are significantly altered by HRT, but the introduction of HRT can still influence seizure frequency due to hormonal changes[4].\n\n### Keppra (Levetiracetam) and HRT\n- Keppra is also not known to interact with HRT in a manner that would affect the levels of the hormones in HRT. Like Depakote, Keppra is one of the AEDs that do not typically interact with HRT, but monitoring for changes in seizure frequency is still advised[4].\n\n### General Considerations for HRT and Epilepsy\n- Studies have shown that certain types of HRT, particularly those containing conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), can increase seizure frequency in women with epilepsy. This effect is dose-related and more pronounced with higher doses of these hormones[2][5].\n- Since you are transitioning and will be taking estrogen and possibly progesterone, it is essential to start with low doses and monitor your seizure frequency. Estrogen is often associated with an increased risk of seizures, while progesterone, especially body-identical progesterone, may have a more neutral or even protective effect[4].\n\n### Practical Advice\n- When starting HRT, it is recommended to use transdermal estrogen and body-identical progesterone to minimize potential adverse effects on seizure control.\n- Monitor your seizure frequency closely and be prepared for potential adjustments to your epilepsy medication dosages.\n- Inform your neurologist about the initiation of HRT so they can monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as necessary.\n\nWhile it is understandable that you might feel uncomfortable discussing this with your neurologist, it is crucial to do so to ensure your safety and optimal management of your epilepsy. Your neurologist can help you navigate the potential interactions and monitor your condition effectively."

        "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

        "answer": "Given the complex and multifaceted nature of your mother's condition, here are some potential causes and factors to consider, as well as suggestions for what to discuss with her doctors:\n\n## Causes of Fainting and Dizziness\n\n### Vasovagal Syncope\nThis is a common cause of syncope in elderly adults, often triggered by standing for long periods, seeing blood, heat exposure, anxiety, or dehydration. It involves a drop in blood pressure and reduced blood flow to the brain[1][3][5].\n\n### Orthostatic Hypotension\nThis condition involves a drop in blood pressure when standing up, which can lead to dizziness and fainting. It is more common in elderly individuals and can be exacerbated by certain medications[2][3][5].\n\n### Cardiac Syncope\nThis is caused by impaired cardiac output due to arrhythmias or structural heart diseases. It is associated with a higher mortality rate in the elderly[3][5].\n\n### Carotid Sinus Syndrome\nThis can cause syncope and unexplained falls, especially triggered by sudden head turning or wearing tight clothing around the neck[3][5].\n\n### Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)\nThis is a common cause of dizziness in seniors, characterized by brief but intense vertigo when moving the head or body[2][4].\n\n### Spinal Degeneration\nProgressive degeneration of the spine can lead to false signals to the brain about the position of the head, causing dizziness and imbalance[2].\n\n### Medication Side Effects\nMany medications, including those for blood pressure, anxiety, and antiseizure drugs like gabapentin and depekote, can cause dizziness as a side effect. Interactions between medications can also exacerbate this issue[2][4].\n\n### Neurological Disorders\nConditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, transient and permanent ischemic stroke, and other neurological disorders can contribute to dizziness and falls[4].\n\n### Psychiatric Disorders\nAnxiety, depression, and other psychiatric conditions can also cause dizziness in elderly individuals[4].\n\n## Cognitive and Motor Symptoms\n\n- **Cognitive Decline**: The significant cognitive decline, including memory loss and inability to perform simple tasks, could be attributed to various factors including the medications she is taking, potential early-onset Alzheimer's, or other neurological conditions. It is crucial to discuss the timing of these symptoms in relation to the medication regimen[1][4].\n- **Motor Symptoms**: The trembling of the hands, jerks, and violent leg shaking could be related to her epilepsy diagnosis or the side effects of her medications. It is important to monitor and report these symptoms to her neurologist and other healthcare providers.\n\n## Recommendations for the Doctor's Visit\n\n- **Detailed Medication History**: Provide a detailed list of all her medications, including dosages and the timing of when each medication is taken. Discuss the potential interactions between gabapentin and depekote and their effects on her cognitive and motor functions.\n- **Symptom Journal**: Keep a journal of when the fainting spells, dizziness, and cognitive decline occur to see if there are any patterns or triggers.\n- **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation**: Ensure a comprehensive evaluation that includes cardiac, neurological, and orthostatic hypotension tests to rule out underlying conditions.\n- **Neurological Assessment**: Given the epilepsy diagnosis, it is crucial to continue monitoring her neurological status and adjust medications as necessary to minimize side effects.\n- **Cognitive Assessment**: Request a cognitive evaluation to determine if there are any signs of early-onset Alzheimer's or other cognitive disorders.\n- **Medication Adjustment**: Discuss the possibility of adjusting her medication regimen to minimize side effects, especially those related to cognitive decline and motor symptoms.\n- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Consider involving a geriatrician, neurologist, cardiologist, and psychiatrist to get a comprehensive view of her condition and manage it effectively.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Social and Financial Support**: Given your concerns about her medical insurance and the financial strain, it may be helpful to explore resources that can assist with medical expenses and caregiving support.\n- **Family Support**: Managing the emotional impact on you and your family is important. Consider seeking support from a therapist or support groups for caregivers.\n\nBy addressing these various aspects, you can help ensure that your mother receives a comprehensive and tailored approach to managing her condition."

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The behavioral and cognitive changes your daughter has experienced after discontinuing valproic acid can be attributed to several factors, given her complex medical and genetic profile.\n\n## Valproic Acid Effects\nValproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that also has mood-stabilizing properties, often used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. In your daughter's case, the medication was initially prescribed to manage her epilepsy. The observed improvements in her behavior, communication, and social interactions after stopping the medication could be due to several reasons:\n\n### Mood Stabilization\nValproic acid can have a stabilizing effect on mood, which might have masked some of her natural behavior and emotional responses. The mood swings she experienced after stopping the medication could indicate that the drug was indeed having a mood-stabilizing effect[4].\n\n### Cognitive and Behavioral Side Effects\nValproic acid can have cognitive and behavioral side effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, and in some cases, a reduction in alertness and awareness. The fact that she seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings after discontinuing the medication suggests that these side effects may have been impacting her previously[4].\n\n### Neurodevelopmental Impact\nIn children with neurodevelopmental disorders, medications like valproic acid can sometimes mask or alter behaviors in ways that are not immediately apparent. The improvement in her language, communication, and ability to follow directions could indicate that the medication was inadvertently hindering these aspects of her development.\n\n## Genetic Considerations\nThe 15q26.1 microdeletion is associated with a range of developmental and physical anomalies. This deletion involves several critical genes that play roles in growth, neurodevelopment, and other physiological processes. Here are some key points related to her genetic condition:\n\n### Developmental Delays\nChildren with 15q26 deletions often experience developmental delays, intellectual disability, and various physical anomalies. These delays can include speech and language development, fine and gross motor skills, and social interactions[3][4][5].\n\n### Epilepsy and Neurological Features\nEpilepsy is a recognized feature in some cases of 15q26 deletions, and the genes within this region, such as *MEF2A*, are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure susceptibility[1][5].\n\n### Behavioral and Social Aspects\nWhile the primary literature on 15q26 deletions focuses on physical and developmental anomalies, there is less detailed information on the specific behavioral and social impacts. However, it is common for children with chromosomal deletions to exhibit a range of behavioral and social challenges, which can be influenced by both the genetic mutation and the medications used to manage related conditions.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe discontinuation of valproic acid has likely removed a medication that was having both therapeutic and side effects on your daughter. The improvements in her behavior, communication, and social interactions could be due to the removal of these side effects, allowing her natural personality and abilities to manifest more clearly. It is important to continue monitoring her development and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to ensure she receives the best possible support for her unique needs. Regular follow-ups with her neurologist and other healthcare providers will be crucial in managing any future changes or challenges."

        "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The presence of \"spike and wave discharges\" in your EEG results, even though you did not have an actual seizure during the recording, provides some important insights:\n\n## Spike and Wave Discharges\nSpike and wave discharges are a type of epileptiform activity that can be seen on an EEG. They are characterized by a sharp spike followed by a slow wave. These discharges are often associated with various forms of epilepsy, particularly generalized epilepsies, but can also be seen in focal epilepsies[1][4].\n\n## Localization\nThe letter mentions that these discharges were observed \"over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal.\" This indicates that the spike and wave activity is not generalized but rather localized to specific areas of your brain. This localization suggests that the epileptiform activity may be originating from or affecting the right frontotemporal and central regions of your brain.\n\n## Interictal vs. Ictal Activity\nThe fact that you did not have an actual seizure during the recording means that these spike and wave discharges are likely interictal, meaning they occurred between seizures. Interictal activity can be useful for diagnosing and localizing the source of seizures, even if a seizure did not occur during the EEG recording[2].\n\n## Implications\n- **Focal Epilepsy**: The localized nature of the discharges (right frontotemporal and central regions) suggests you might have a form of focal epilepsy, where the seizures originate from a specific area of the brain rather than being generalized.\n- **Risk of Seizures**: The presence of these discharges indicates an increased risk of seizures, even if you did not experience one during the EEG.\n- **Further Evaluation**: Your neurologist may recommend further testing, such as additional EEGs, MRI scans, or other diagnostic tools to better understand the source and nature of these discharges.\n\n## Next Steps\nIt is crucial to discuss these findings with your neurologist as soon as possible to understand the full implications and to determine the best course of action. They may adjust your treatment plan or recommend additional evaluations based on these results.\n\nIn summary, the spike and wave discharges observed in your EEG suggest focal epileptiform activity, which your neurologist will need to evaluate further to determine the appropriate management and treatment."

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

        "answer": "Given your situation, here are some key points and potential avenues for obtaining affordable medical insurance and addressing your health concerns:\n\n### Eligibility for Covered California and Medi-Cal\n\n- Your current income from unemployment ($630 per week) places you above the threshold for free Medi-Cal but may still qualify you for subsidized health insurance through Covered California. However, the income limits for Covered California subsidies are based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), and your current income might not qualify you for the most generous subsidies[2][5].\n\n### Income Calculation and Subsidies\n- To determine your eligibility, Covered California uses your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI), which includes unemployment benefits, Social Security payments, and other income sources. You can use Covered California\u2019s calculator to estimate your eligibility[2][5].\n\n### Special Considerations\n- Since you have a serious medical condition, you might be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) if you experience a qualifying life event, such as losing your current income or experiencing a significant change in your health status. This could allow you to enroll in a plan outside of the regular open enrollment period[4].\n\n### Medically Needy Programs\n- California offers programs for individuals who have high medical expenses relative to their income. If your medical expenses are substantial, you might qualify for the Medically Needy program, which could help cover some of your costs[5].\n\n### County and Local Resources\n- You should contact San Diego County social services or health department to inquire about any local programs or assistance that might be available for individuals with severe medical conditions. They may have specific programs or resources that can help bridge the gap until you can qualify for other forms of coverage.\n\n### Disability and Short-Term Disability\n- If your condition prevents you from working, you may be eligible for short-term disability through your employer or the state of California. For long-term conditions, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is an option, although it can be challenging to qualify, especially under the age of 50.\n\n### Using Foreign Medical Records\n- While the medical records from Mexico are in Spanish, you can get them translated and submit them as part of your application for medical assistance. However, for certain programs or further treatment, you may need to obtain additional diagnoses or documentation from a U.S. healthcare provider.\n\n### Charity Care Programs\n- Many hospitals, including those in San Diego, have charity care programs that can help reduce or eliminate medical bills for individuals who cannot afford them. You should contact the hospital where you had the ER visit to see if you qualify for such a program.\n\n### Immediate Action\n- Here are some steps you can take:\n  - **Contact Covered California**: Explain your situation and ask if there are any special considerations or programs that can help given your medical condition[1][4].\n  - **Reach Out to Local Health Services**: Contact San Diego County health services to explore any local resources or programs that might assist you.\n  - **Hospital Charity Care**: Contact the hospital where you had the ER visit to inquire about their charity care program.\n  - **Short-Term Disability**: Talk to your employer or state disability office about short-term disability options.\n  - **Translation of Records**: Get your Mexican medical records translated and prepared for submission to U.S. healthcare providers or for application purposes.\n\nGiven the complexity and urgency of your situation, seeking guidance from a healthcare navigator or a social worker who specializes in healthcare access could be highly beneficial. They can help you navigate the system and identify the most appropriate resources and programs for your specific needs."

        "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the changes you're observing in your seizure presentations, it's important to consider several factors to differentiate between epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizures (NES), also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES).\n\n### Aura and Seizure Presentation\n- The presence of an aura, especially one that is consistent with your previous epileptic seizures (such as a cold, tingly feeling on the left side of the body, visual disturbance in the left eye, and a sinking feeling in the stomach), suggests that the episodes could still be epileptic in nature. Auras are typically associated with focal seizures, including those originating from the temporal lobe[1][5].\n\n### Differences in Post-Ictal Phase\n- The absence of a severe post-ictal headache and the difference in the post-seizure recovery could indicate a change in the type of seizures you are experiencing, but it does not necessarily point to PNES. People with epilepsy can experience varying post-ictal symptoms over time, especially if there are changes in the seizure focus or type[1].\n\n### New Symptoms and Work-Related Triggers\n- The new symptoms of face twitching, limb twitching, and trouble breathing could be a new manifestation of your temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly if these episodes are still preceded by your typical aura. Epilepsy can evolve over time, and new seizure types or symptoms can emerge[1][3].\n- However, the fact that these seizures only happen at work could suggest a psychological component, such as stress triggering PNES. PNES can be triggered by psychological stressors and can present with a variety of symptoms, including motor movements and breathing difficulties[2][4].\n\n### Awareness During Episodes\n- People having PNES can often recall parts of what happened during the episode or feel a sense of distance from their environment, which is different from the typical post-ictal confusion seen in epileptic seizures. If you are aware of your surroundings or remember the episode more clearly than you would with your usual seizures, it might suggest PNES[2][4].\n\n### Diagnostic Considerations\n- It is crucial to consult your healthcare provider and undergo further diagnostic testing to determine the nature of these new episodes. This may include:\n  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) to check for electrical activity in the brain.\n  - Video EEG monitoring to observe and record the episodes.\n  - Psychological evaluation to assess for stress and other psychological factors that might be contributing to PNES.\n  - Other tests such as MRI to rule out any new structural changes in the brain[1][3][4].\n\nIn summary, while the presence of an aura and some consistency with your previous seizure symptoms suggest that these episodes could still be epileptic, the new symptoms and the specific context (only occurring at work) also raise the possibility of PNES triggered by stress. A thorough medical evaluation is necessary to differentiate between these two possibilities."

        "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of being treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for what was later determined to be non-epileptic seizures, it is plausible that these medications may have had an impact on your mood, even if that was not their primary intention.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n## Effects of AEDs on Mood\nAEDs can have both positive and negative effects on mood and behavior. Some of these drugs are known to influence mood by various mechanisms, such as potentiation of GABA neurotransmission, folate deficiency, and pharmacodynamic interactions[1][3].\n\n## Specific Medications\nYou were treated with topiramate, lamotrigine, epilim (valproate), and keppra (levetiracetam).\n\n- **Topiramate**: This medication has been associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, affecting up to 10% of patients[1].\n- **Lamotrigine**: While lamotrigine is often used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder and can have positive effects on mood, it can also have variable effects depending on the individual. It is generally considered to have a lower risk of inducing depression compared to some other AEDs[1][5].\n- **Valproate (Epilim)**: Valproate is known to have a low risk of inducing depression and can even have a positive effect on mood. It is often used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder[1][5].\n- **Levetiracetam (Keppra)**: This medication has an intermediate risk profile, with a prevalence of depression of about 4% or lower[1].\n\n## Withdrawal and Current Mood Swings\nAfter stopping these medications, you may have experienced withdrawal effects or a change in your underlying mood regulation. The abrupt cessation of long-term AED use could lead to significant mood swings, especially if these drugs were influencing your mood and emotional stability.\n\n## Underlying Conditions\nYour conditions, such as endometriosis and PCOS, can also contribute to mood instability. Additionally, the diagnosis of non-epileptic seizures may indicate underlying psychological or psychosocial factors that could be influencing your mood.\n\n## Current Medication\nYou are currently on mirtazapine, an antidepressant that can help stabilize mood. However, given your complex medical history and the recent severe mood swings, it might be beneficial to reassess your medication regimen and consider other factors that could be contributing to your mood instability.\n\n## Conclusion\nIt is indeed possible that the long-term use of AEDs was unintentionally treating or influencing aspects of your mood. The withdrawal from these medications, combined with your underlying medical conditions and other psychosocial factors, may be contributing to your current mood swings. Consulting with your healthcare provider to adjust your treatment plan and potentially incorporating psychological therapies may help in managing your mood more effectively."

        "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the persistent headaches you are experiencing, here are several factors and potential connections to consider:\n\n## Epilepsy Medications and Side Effects\nMany of the medications you are taking for epilepsy can contribute to headaches or exacerbate existing headache conditions.\n\n- **Levetiracetam**: Common side effects include headache, dizziness, and nausea. While it is effective for seizures, it could be contributing to your headaches[4|.\n- **Zonisamide**: This medication can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea among its side effects[1|.\n- **Baclofen**: Though less common, baclofen can cause headaches as a side effect[1|.\n- **Propranolol**: While used to help with anxiety, propranolol is a beta-blocker and can sometimes cause or worsen headaches in some individuals.\n\n## Headache Characteristics\nThe description of your headaches, including the visual auras (\"white flashing waves of light\"), nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound, suggests they could be related to migraines or a migraine-like phenomenon, even though the intensity has decreased since your teenage years.\n\n## Interaction with Other Medications\nThe use of multiple medications, including those for seizure control and other conditions, can lead to drug interactions that might exacerbate headaches.\n\n- **Ibuprofen and Kratom**: While these are used to manage headache pain, they may not be addressing the underlying cause. Kratom, in particular, has opioid-like effects but is not typically recommended for long-term use due to its potential for dependence and other side effects.\n- **Acamprosate, Baclofen, and Librium**: These medications, although not directly indicated for headaches, could potentially interact with other medications or contribute to side effects that include headaches.\n\n## Lifestyle Factors\n- **Nicotine Use**: Although you mentioned nicotine use is infrequent, nicotine can sometimes trigger or worsen headaches.\n- **Sleep and Diet**: Your sleep apnea is now better managed with the BiPAP setup, which reduces the likelihood that sleep disturbances are causing the headaches. Your high-fat keto diet does not seem to affect the headaches, suggesting that dietary factors may not be the primary cause.\n\n## Recommendations for Discussion with Doctors\n1. **Medication Review**:\n   - Discuss the possibility of adjusting your epilepsy medications to see if this alleviates the headaches. Sometimes, a change in medication or dosage can significantly impact side effects.\n   - Consider whether any of the medications could be contributing to the headaches and if alternatives are available.\n\n2. **Headache-Specific Treatments**:\n   - Since Imitrex and other migraine-specific medications did not help in the past, it might be worth exploring other options like triptans, ergots, or preventive migraine medications.\n   - Given the visual auras and sensitivity to light and sound, a migraine specialist could provide additional insights.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**:\n   - Ensure your doctors conduct a thorough evaluation to rule out other causes of headaches, such as tension headaches or other neurological conditions that could be exacerbating the situation.\n   - Imaging studies (e.g., MRI) might be considered to rule out any structural causes for the headaches.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:\n   - Continue to monitor and manage sleep, diet, and nicotine use to ensure these are not contributing factors.\n   - Consider stress management techniques, as stress can exacerbate both seizures and headaches.\n\n5. **Side Effect Monitoring**:\n   - Keep a detailed journal of your headaches, including when they occur, their intensity, and any potential triggers. This can help your doctors better understand the pattern and make more informed decisions.\n\nBy presenting these points to your doctors, you can work together to better understand and manage your persistent headaches."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of a possible seizure and your current management of the condition, there are several factors to consider before engaging in welding activities.\n\n## Safety Concerns with Seizures\n- Seizures can be unpredictable, and even if you have had no issues for 3 years, there is still a risk of another seizure occurring. This could be particularly hazardous when operating equipment like a welder, as it involves working with high temperatures, electrical currents, and potentially flammable materials[2][4].\n\n## Physical and Cognitive Demands of Welding\n- Welding requires high levels of concentration, physical stability, and coordination. A seizure could compromise these abilities, putting you and others at risk of injury or accident[3].\n\n## Health Implications of Welding\n- Welding involves exposure to welding fumes, which can contain harmful substances like manganese. This exposure has been linked to neurological problems, including potential brain damage and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. Given your existing neurological condition, this could be an additional risk factor to consider[5].\n\n## Protective Measures\n- While using every form of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is crucial and beneficial for general safety, it does not mitigate the risk of a seizure occurring during welding. PPE can protect against physical hazards but not against the unpredictable nature of seizures.\n\n## Recommendations\n- It would be advisable to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new activity that could potentially pose a risk, especially one as hazardous as welding. Your healthcare provider can evaluate your current condition, the effectiveness of your medication, and any other factors that might influence your safety while welding.\n- You may need to undergo additional medical evaluations or tests to assess your suitability for such activities.\n- Considering the potential risks, it might be prudent to explore alternative hobbies or professions that do not involve such high levels of physical and cognitive risk.\n\nIn summary, while you have taken steps to manage your seizures, the inherent risks associated with welding, combined with the potential for neurological complications from welding fumes, make it a high-risk activity for someone with a history of seizures. A thorough consultation with your healthcare provider is essential before proceeding."

It happens when I\u2019m waking up, falling asleep, or laying in bed It\u2019s kinda like a whooshing feeling",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing are consistent with sleep paralysis, but they include some unique and intense sensory experiences. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what you might be experiencing:\n\n## Atonia and Paralysis\nThe primary symptom of sleep paralysis is the inability to move or speak, which you mentioned. This occurs when your body is in the REM sleep stage, where muscles are paralyzed to prevent acting out dreams, but your mind is partially awake[1][4][5].\n\n## Hallucinations and Sensory Experiences\n- **Hallucinations**: Sleep paralysis often involves hallucinations, which can be auditory, visual, or tactile. Your descriptions of feeling like your brain is \"tight\" or \"rattling,\" or like you're in a \"hurricane,\" are types of hallucinations that can occur during sleep paralysis. These hallucinations can be very vivid and distressing[1][4][5].\n- **Vestibular-Motor Hallucinations**: The sensation of being in a hurricane or feeling like your head is moving (even though it's not) can be classified as vestibular-motor hallucinations, which involve feelings of movement or out-of-body experiences[4][5].\n\n## Hypnagogic and Hypnopompic Hallucinations\n- These hallucinations occur when you're falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic). Your experience of feeling a \"magnet\" moving your hand to your forehead, despite the hand not actually moving, is an example of these types of hallucinations[1][4].\n\n## Other Sensory Experiences\n- **Chest Pressure and Suffocation**: While you didn't specifically mention chest pressure, the feelings of tightness and the hurricane-like sensation could be related to the common experience of chest pressure or suffocation during sleep paralysis[1][4][5].\n- **Auditory Sensations**: The whooshing feeling or the sensation of hearing something (like a rattling in your brain) are also common auditory hallucinations associated with sleep paralysis[5].\n\n## Control Over Hallucinations\n- Your ability to influence the intensity of the hurricane feeling by asking yourself yes or no questions is an interesting aspect. While it's not a typical feature of sleep paralysis, it might suggest a level of brain activity or cognitive engagement during the episode that is unique to your experiences.\n\n## Causes and Triggers\n- Sleep paralysis can be triggered by disrupted sleep schedules, stress, social anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Ensuring good sleep hygiene, managing stress, and addressing any underlying mental health issues can help reduce the frequency of these episodes[1][4][5].\n\nIf these episodes are disrupting your daily life or causing significant distress, it would be advisable to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to these experiences."

So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG\u2019s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I\u2019m scared.. I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.)

        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the postpartum context, it is crucial to consider several potential causes and to undergo a comprehensive evaluation. Here are some key points and tests that might be relevant:\n\n## Differential Diagnosis for Postpartum Seizures\n\n1. **Eclampsia and Pre-eclampsia**: Although eclampsia is typically associated with seizures during or immediately after pregnancy, it can occasionally occur up to 6 weeks postpartum. Symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, and upper abdominal pain are common prodromal signs[3][5].\n2. **Dural Puncture and Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)**: If you had an epidural during delivery, dural puncture could be a cause, especially if accompanied by headache, nausea, and visual disturbances. However, this is less likely given the duration of your symptoms[1].\n3. **Other Neurological Conditions**: Conditions like meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage need to be ruled out. These can be identified through imaging studies like CT scans and MRI, as well as lumbar puncture if necessary[1][3].\n4. **Metabolic and Electrolyte Imbalances**: Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and other metabolic disturbances can cause seizures. These can be checked through blood tests[3].\n\n## Tests and Evaluations\n\n1. **EEG Monitoring**: You are already scheduled for extended EEG monitoring, which is crucial for diagnosing seizure disorders. The fact that previous shorter EEGs were normal does not rule out the possibility of seizures, as seizures can be intermittent.\n2. **Imaging Studies**: CT scans and MRI can help rule out structural abnormalities such as intracranial hemorrhages, tumors, or other lesions.\n3. **Blood Tests**: Comprehensive metabolic panels to check electrolytes, glucose, and other metabolic parameters are essential. Additionally, tests for magnesium levels, liver function, renal function, and urinalysis can help identify any underlying metabolic issues[3].\n4. **Lumbar Puncture**: This may be necessary to rule out meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially if imaging studies are not conclusive.\n5. **Cardiovascular Evaluation**: Given your symptoms of dizziness and muscle weakness, a cardiovascular evaluation, including EKG and possibly an echocardiogram, may be warranted.\n\n## Management and Tips\n\n1. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Your care should involve a team of healthcare providers including neurologists, obstetricians, and possibly cardiologists to ensure all potential causes are considered[1].\n2. **Safety Precautions**: Ensure your environment is safe to prevent injuries during episodes. This might include removing hazards, using protective gear, and having someone with you when caring for your baby.\n3. **Medication and Treatment**: If eclampsia or pre-eclampsia is suspected, treatment with magnesium sulfate and blood pressure management will be crucial. For other conditions, treatment will depend on the specific diagnosis[3][5].\n\n## Passing the Time During Observation\n\n- **Books and Audiobooks**: Bring a favorite book or listen to audiobooks to keep your mind occupied.\n- **Music and Podcasts**: Listen to music or podcasts that you enjoy.\n- **Journaling**: Writing down your thoughts, feelings, and any symptoms can be helpful for both you and your healthcare team.\n- **Comfort Items**: Bring a favorite blanket, pillow, or other comfort items to make your stay more pleasant.\n- **Visitor Support**: Have family or friends visit to provide emotional support and help pass the time.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Doctors\n\n- **Detailed Symptom History**: Ensure your healthcare team has a detailed account of your symptoms, including the timing and triggers of your episodes.\n- **Previous Medical History**: Discuss any medications you have taken during pregnancy and postpartum, as well as any previous medical conditions.\n- **Psychological Impact**: Share your feelings of anxiety, depression, and the psychological impact of these episodes on your ability to care for your baby.\n- **Alternative Diagnoses**: Ask about other potential causes that might not be immediately obvious, such as autoimmune disorders or neurological conditions that are less common.\n\nGiven your complex and varied symptoms, it is essential to maintain open communication with your healthcare team and ensure all possible causes are thoroughly investigated."

        "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your complex medical history and the interplay between your past seizures and current symptoms, it is crucial to consult with specialists who can provide a comprehensive evaluation. Here are some recommendations and insights:\n\n## Neurologist\nA neurologist would be an excellent starting point, especially given your history of temporal lobe epilepsy. They can:\n- Evaluate the current status of your epilepsy and determine if the recent normal EEG indicates that you are indeed seizure-free.\n- Assess if any long-term cognitive, behavioral, or emotional changes are directly related to the seizures you experienced in childhood.\n- Consider the impact of the head injury from the riding accident, although it seems minor, it could still contribute to some of your symptoms[3].\n\n## Neuropsychologist\nA neuropsychological evaluation would be highly beneficial in this case. A neuropsychologist can:\n- Conduct comprehensive cognitive and behavioral assessments to determine the extent to which your current difficulties with concentration, memory, anxiety, and depression are due to the residual effects of seizures versus other factors like PTSD.\n- Provide a detailed report on cognitive functioning, including areas such as executive function, processing speed, and memory, which could be affected by both seizures and PTSD[1][5].\n\n## Pain Center and Stellate Ganglion Block\nIf you are considering a stellate ganglion block for PTSD symptoms, consulting with the pain center is a good idea. However, this should be done in conjunction with other evaluations to ensure that you are addressing all potential underlying causes of your symptoms. The pain center can help with the specific procedure but might not provide a holistic view of your overall condition.\n\n## Long-term Consequences of Seizures\nThe long-term consequences of having repeated seizures, especially those originating in the temporal lobe, can be significant:\n- Cognitive impairment: Repeated seizures can lead to cognitive deficits in multiple domains, including attention, executive function, and memory, even if the seizures have stopped[1][5].\n- Behavioral and Emotional Changes: Seizures can affect widespread brain networks, leading to issues with emotional regulation, anxiety, and depression[1].\n- Persistent Brain Changes: Studies suggest that even after seizures have ceased, some brain changes may be permanent, although some improvements can be seen with appropriate treatment like surgical intervention[1].\n\n## PTSD and Its Impact\nGiven your history of traumatic events, PTSD is likely contributing to your current symptoms. Untreated PTSD can lead to significant mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, as well as physical health problems like chronic pain and sleep disturbances[2].\n\n## Comprehensive Approach\nTo minimize medical bills while getting a comprehensive understanding, you could start by seeing a neurologist who can coordinate or refer you to other specialists such as a neuropsychologist. A therapist, especially one with experience in PTSD, can continue to be part of your care team, working in conjunction with the medical specialists.\n\nIn summary, consulting a neurologist first, followed by a neuropsychological evaluation, would provide the most comprehensive understanding of your condition and help differentiate between the effects of your past seizures and PTSD."

It is an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug, which means it can affect the metabolism of hormones. Specifically, Depakote can decrease the levels of certain hormones, including estrogen and testosterone, by inducing the enzymes that metabolize these hormones[2][5].\n- There is a potential for bidirectional interactions between Depakote and estrogen therapy. For example, estrogen can also affect the serum concentration of valproate (the active component of Depakote), although this effect is typically less significant[2].\n\n## Keppra (Levetiracetam)\n- Keppra is generally considered to have fewer interactions with other medications, including hormones, compared to other antiepileptic drugs. However, there is limited specific research on the interactions between Keppra and HRT. It is less likely to have significant effects on hormone levels, but monitoring is still advisable[2][5].\n\n## General Considerations\n- The interaction between antiepileptic drugs and HRT can be complex and bidirectional. For instance, estrogen therapy can decrease the serum concentration of certain antiepileptic drugs like lamotrigine, but the effect on Depakote and Keppra is less clear and may require individual monitoring[2][3].\n- It is crucial to monitor your hormone levels and adjust your medication doses as necessary when starting HRT. Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to manage both your epilepsy and hormone therapy are essential to avoid any adverse effects on seizure control or hormone therapy efficacy[1][2][5].\n\n## Recommendations\n- Inform your healthcare provider about all the medications, supplements, and hormone therapies you are taking or planning to take. This will help in managing your care effectively and minimizing potential interactions.\n- Be prepared for regular monitoring of both your hormone levels and seizure control to adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nGiven your specific seizure disorder, Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, and the medications you are currently taking, close monitoring and coordination with your healthcare provider will be essential to ensure that your transition to HRT does not compromise your seizure control."

        "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the context of your epilepsy diagnosis, there are several factors to consider:\n\n## Absence Seizures\nAbsence seizures, also known as petit mal seizures, typically last only a few seconds (usually less than 20 seconds) and are characterized by a brief loss of awareness. However, your described episodes last for hours, which is not typical for absence seizures. Absence seizures usually do not result in prolonged periods of altered consciousness or fatigue lasting hours[1][3][5].\n\n## Current Medication\nYou are taking Medotrigin (lamotrigine) and Timonil retard (likely a form of valproate or another antiepileptic medication). While these medications are commonly used to treat absence seizures, the fact that your symptoms have worsened and the episodes are longer and more frequent suggests that the current treatment regimen may not be fully effective for you[1][4].\n\n## Symptoms and Possible Misdiagnosis\nYour symptoms, such as prolonged episodes of altered consciousness, sensitivity to light and noise, and the inability to react or remember events, could indicate a different type of seizure or an additional neurological condition. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n- **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures**: These seizures can cause longer periods of confusion and altered consciousness compared to absence seizures. They may also be associated with auras, confusion after the seizure, and can last longer than 30 to 45 seconds[1].\n- **Other Types of Seizures**: You might be experiencing other types of seizures, such as focal seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which can manifest differently and may require different treatment approaches.\n- **Side Effects of Medication**: Some antiepileptic medications can have side effects that include cognitive impairments, dizziness, and fatigue. However, the prolonged and frequent nature of your episodes suggests more than just medication side effects[2][4].\n\n## Diagnostic Reevaluation\nGiven the severity and frequency of your symptoms, it is crucial to have a thorough reevaluation by your healthcare provider. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n- **Detailed EEG and Video EEG**: To capture the full extent of your seizures, especially since your current EEG results have been reported as normal but your symptoms suggest otherwise[3][5].\n- **Neurological Examination**: A comprehensive neurological examination to check for other neurological signs or conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n- **Imaging Studies**: Repeating or additional imaging studies like MRI or CT scans to rule out any structural brain abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms.\n- **Blood and Urine Tests**: To check for other health issues that could be contributing to your condition.\n\n## Psychological and Social Support\nThe emotional and psychological impact of your condition is significant, and it is important to address these aspects as well. Seeking support from a mental health professional can help you manage depression, anxiety, and stress related to your condition.\n\n## Lifestyle Adjustments\nManaging stress and ensuring adequate sleep are crucial for controlling seizures. Discuss with your healthcare provider strategies for managing stress and improving sleep quality[5].\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and the potential for a misdiagnosis or an additional condition, it is essential to have an open and detailed conversation with your healthcare provider to adjust your treatment plan accordingly."

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your ongoing and worsening fainting episodes, despite the initial diagnosis of vasovagal syncope, it is important to consider several other potential causes and factors:\n\n## Cardiac Causes\n- The presence of heart rate pauses (sinus pauses) lasting 5-13 seconds, as shown by your implanted loop recorder, is a significant finding. While cardiologists have suggested vasovagal syncope, these pauses could also be indicative of a cardiac issue that needs further evaluation. Cardiac syncope, caused by arrhythmias or structural heart problems, should still be considered[1][4][5].\n\n## Neurological Causes\n- The referral to a neurologist is a good step, especially given your symptoms of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, surreal feelings, and post-episode cognitive issues like fogginess and short-term memory problems. These symptoms could suggest a neurological component that was not fully explored in your previous evaluations.\n  - **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy**: While less common, it is possible that your symptoms could be related to a form of epilepsy. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and surreal feelings are sometimes associated with seizures, particularly those originating from the temporal lobe. Sinus pauses can be an atypical symptom in some cases of epilepsy, making this a worthwhile area for investigation[3].\n\n## Hormonal Influences\n- The pattern of episodes occurring in the week before your period suggests a possible hormonal component. Hormonal changes can affect blood pressure, heart rate, and even neurological function. Discussing this pattern with your neurologist or an endocrinologist might provide additional insights.\n\n## Other Considerations\n- **Orthostatic Hypotension**: Although you mentioned that the episodes are not solely related to standing or sitting, orthostatic hypotension can still be a factor, especially if you experience drops in blood pressure when changing positions. This could be exacerbated by dehydration or certain medications[1][4].\n- **Medication Side Effects**: Ensure that none of your current medications are contributing to your symptoms. Certain drugs, especially those affecting blood pressure or the nervous system, can lead to fainting[1][3].\n\n## Immediate Steps\n- Continue to manage your stress through meditation, gym, and counseling, as these can help mitigate some triggers.\n- Keep a detailed diary of your episodes, including any triggers you suspect, your position when the episode occurs, and any symptoms before and after the episode. This can be helpful for your upcoming neurologist appointment.\n- Discuss the possibility of a temporary event monitor or further cardiac testing to rule out any intermittent cardiac issues that may not be captured by your current loop recorder.\n\n## Communication with Doctors\n- It's crucial to communicate your concerns and the details of your episodes clearly with both your cardiologists and the upcoming neurologist. Emphasize the increasing frequency, the change in positions during episodes, and the post-episode cognitive and physical symptoms you experience.\n\nBy taking these steps and considering multiple potential causes, you may be able to get a more comprehensive understanding and appropriate management of your condition."

        "question": " Female, 20, 5\"7\", 250lbs, CaucasianNo drug use, no current medication,For the past 6 years I've been having what I think is sleep paralysis fits, the symptoms are like this:I have a weird feeling before sleeping, I can't describe it but when i feel it i know i'm gonna fall into sleep paralysis. then I can't move anything, i'm aware of of my surroundings, scary ominous aura, and sometimes theres this loud ringing, like so loud I feel it in my head pulsing, then pain in my body like fingers being pushed in my sides, and even i sometimes feel my body...buzzing? or shaking fast i dont know if its happening IRL or just in my sleep, or a part of my brain feels like electricity, its usually painful, but there was one time it felt...kinda not bad...like a brain massage, then it went down my back. I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing are consistent with sleep paralysis, which is a relatively common condition, especially in young adults. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Causes and Triggers\n- Sleep paralysis is often linked to sleep deprivation, irregular sleep schedules, and stress, all of which you have mentioned as factors in your experience[1][3][5].\n- Sleeping on your back is commonly associated with sleep paralysis, although you mentioned you sleep on your side, which might reduce this risk.\n- Other triggers include mental health conditions such as anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorder, as well as certain sleep disorders like narcolepsy and sleep apnea, which you suspect you might have[1][3][5].\n\n## Symptoms\n- The inability to move or speak while being fully aware of your surroundings is a hallmark symptom of sleep paralysis.\n- Hallucinations, both visual and auditory, are common, as are feelings of pressure on the chest or other parts of the body. Your descriptions of loud ringing, pain, and buzzing or shaking sensations fit within these symptoms[1][3][5].\n- Out-of-body experiences and hearing voices are also reported by some individuals during sleep paralysis episodes.\n- The episodes are usually brief but can be very frightening and leave you feeling drained and sore afterward[1][3][5].\n\n## Differentiation from Seizures\n- While the sensations you described, such as a \"brain electric feeling\" or muscle pains, can be alarming, they are more typical of sleep paralysis than seizures. Seizures typically involve loss of consciousness and more pronounced physical movements or convulsions, which you do not seem to be experiencing[1][3][5].\n\n## Management\n- Since you cannot currently visit a doctor, focusing on maintaining healthy sleep habits is crucial. Ensure you get adequate sleep, maintain a regular sleep schedule, and avoid staying awake for extended periods[1][3][5].\n- Stress management techniques such as relaxation, meditation, or cognitive behavioral therapy can also help reduce the frequency of sleep paralysis episodes[5].\n\n## Safety and Next Steps\n- While it is understandable that you cannot visit a doctor immediately due to your current situation, it is important to seek medical advice as soon as it is safe to do so. Your healthcare provider can help rule out other sleep disorders or underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n- In the meantime, keeping a sleep diary to track your sleep patterns and any episodes of sleep paralysis can be helpful for future consultations.\n\nGiven your description, it is highly likely that you are experiencing sleep paralysis rather than seizures. However, seeking a professional diagnosis when possible will help in confirming this and addressing any underlying issues."

        "question": "Male 18 75kg 6ft black I started having these episodes last December. So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The symptoms you are describing could be indicative of several potential neurological or medical conditions. Here are some possibilities based on your descriptions:\n\n## Temporal Lobe Seizures or Auras\nThe episodes you described, particularly the ones involving d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, head pain, dizziness, and the recall of a specific memory followed by immediate forgetting, could be indicative of temporal lobe seizures or auras. Temporal lobe seizures often involve the hippocampus and surrounding structures, which are crucial for episodic memory and emotional processing. Symptoms can include an aura (a warning sign) such as a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, or joy, followed by confusion, staring, and repetitive behaviors[3].\n\n## Post-Traumatic Amnesia\nThe incident involving the car crash and subsequent memory loss could be related to post-traumatic amnesia, which is a common consequence of traumatic brain injuries. This condition can result in memory gaps for events surrounding the trauma, as well as confusion and disorientation[4].\n\n## Dissociative Amnesia\nThe episodes where you feel disoriented and do not recognize people or places, such as the incident with your coworker, might suggest dissociative amnesia. This condition is often linked to traumatic events and can result in memory gaps or the inability to recall specific events[1].\n\n## Other Potential Causes\n- **Stress and Anxiety:** Stressful events, panic attacks, and anxiety can also affect memory and cause symptoms like dizziness and confusion. The hippocampus and amygdala, regions crucial for episodic memory and emotional processing, are sensitive to stress and trauma[1].\n- **Medical Conditions:** Conditions such as dehydration, low blood sugar, or other metabolic issues can cause dizziness, nausea, and memory lapses. However, these are typically more transient and not as complex as the episodes you described[5].\n\n## Recommendations\nGiven the complexity and recurrence of your symptoms, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a specialist, such as a neurologist or a psychiatrist. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n- **Comprehensive Medical Examination:** A thorough medical evaluation can help identify any underlying neurological or medical conditions that might be causing your symptoms.\n- **Neurological Testing:** Tests such as EEG (electroencephalogram) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) might be necessary to diagnose conditions like temporal lobe seizures or assess any structural brain abnormalities.\n- **Detailed History:** Sharing a detailed account of your symptoms and any triggers or preceding events can help your healthcare provider narrow down the possible causes.\n\nIt is important not to self-diagnose or delay seeking medical help, as early diagnosis and treatment can significantly impact the management and outcome of many neurological conditions."

        "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of fainting, particularly on airplanes, here are some insights and additional strategies that might help you prevent or manage these episodes:\n\n## Understanding the Causes\n\n### Air Travel Specifics\n- Air travel can exacerbate fainting due to several factors, including hypobaric hypoxia (low oxygen levels at high altitudes), cabin pressure fluctuations, and immobility. These conditions can lead to postural hypotension and hypoxic syncope, which are common causes of fainting on planes[4].\n\n### General Fainting Causes\n- Your symptoms of dizziness, feeling hot and clammy, and ear ringing are indicative of a vasovagal response, which is a common cause of fainting. This can be triggered by various factors such as dehydration, heat, and stress.\n- Despite your normal test results, it is clear that you experience orthostatic vasovagal hypotension, which is characterized by a drop in blood pressure when changing positions or experiencing stressors like those on an airplane[4].\n\n## Prevention Strategies\n\n### Fluid and Salt Intake\n- Continuing to increase your fluid intake (aiming for at least 2.5-3 liters a day) and salt consumption before and during the flight is crucial. Salt helps increase the volume of plasma in your blood, which can help maintain blood pressure[1][4].\n\n### Positioning and Movement\n- When you start to feel faint, try to sit down and, if possible, lie down with your feet elevated. This can help increase venous return and prevent a drop in blood pressure[1][4].\n\n### Isometric Counter-Pressure Exercises\n- Learning isometric counter-pressure exercises can be helpful. These exercises involve squeezing your leg and gluteal muscles to force blood back up to your heart, which can increase your blood pressure[1].\n\n### Compression Stockings\n- You are already wearing compression socks, which is a good step. Ensure they are grade 2 or 3 compression stockings to effectively prevent blood from pooling in your legs[1].\n\n### Travel Preparations\n- **Stay Hydrated:** Continue drinking plenty of water before, during, and after the flight.\n- **Avoid Dehydrating Substances:** Avoid coffee and alcohol as they can exacerbate dehydration.\n- **Eat Regularly:** Maintain your routine of having regular, filling meals to prevent hypoglycemia and ensure stable energy levels.\n- **Rest:** Get a good night's sleep before the flight to reduce fatigue and stress[5].\n\n### In-Flight Management\n- **Choose a Window Seat:** This can help stabilize your visual focus and reduce motion sickness.\n- **Slow Movements:** Avoid sudden movements, as they can trigger or worsen symptoms.\n- **Ear Protection:** Use noise-canceling headphones or earplugs to regulate inner ear pressure.\n- **Avoid Alcohol and Caffeine:** These can dehydrate you and exacerbate symptoms[2][5].\n\n### Medical Considerations\n- While your specialists have ruled out several conditions, it may be worth discussing the use of medications like midodrine or fludrocortisone with your cardiologist or primary care physician. These medications are often prescribed to prevent fainting episodes[1].\n\n## Additional Tips\n\n- **Inform the Flight Crew:** Let the flight attendants know about your history of fainting. They can provide assistance if needed and monitor your condition during the flight.\n- **Mental Preparation:** Engage in mental challenges or activities that can help maintain your sympathetic activity and reduce the likelihood of fainting[4].\n\nBy combining these strategies, you may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of your fainting episodes during air travel. It is also beneficial to continue consulting with your healthcare providers to refine your prevention plan."

        "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The energy changes and physical performance issues you're experiencing can be attributed to several factors, including the effects of the medication, the underlying epilepsy itself, and potential lifestyle changes.\n\n## Medication Side Effects\nKeppra (levetiracetam), the medication you are taking, is known to cause several side effects that could explain your reduced energy levels and physical performance. Common side effects include:\n- Fatigue and weakness[2][4][5]\n- Dizziness and sleepiness[1][2][4]\n- Reduced coordination and muscle strength[1][5]\n\nThese side effects can significantly impact your ability to engage in physical activities like working out or hiking.\n\n## Epilepsy and Physical Performance\nEpilepsy itself can affect physical performance due to several reasons:\n- Seizures can cause physical exhaustion and muscle fatigue.\n- The neurological nature of epilepsy might influence overall energy levels and physical capabilities.\n- Lifestyle changes, such as reduced physical activity due to seizures or medication side effects, can lead to weight gain and further reduce energy levels[3].\n\n## Psychological and Motivational Factors\nThe emotional and psychological impact of a significant life change, such as losing a career and experiencing a major health event, should not be underestimated. Depression, irritability, and mood swings are common side effects of Keppra, which can further demotivate you from engaging in physical activities[1][4][5].\n\n## Medical Consultation\nWhile it's frustrating that your doctors might not be fully addressing your concerns, it's crucial to persist in discussing these issues. Here are some steps you can take:\n- **Detailed Documentation**: Keep a detailed log of your energy levels, physical activities, and any side effects you experience. This can help your doctor see patterns and correlations.\n- **Alternative Medications**: Discuss the possibility of adjusting your medication or exploring other antiepileptic drugs that might have fewer side effects impacting your energy levels.\n- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Consider consulting with a neurologist, a physical therapist, and a psychologist to address the various aspects of your condition.\n\n## Autoimmune Disease\nWhile it's possible that an underlying autoimmune condition could be contributing to your seizures or energy levels, this is less likely to be the primary cause given that your seizures started with a significant epileptic event. However, discussing this possibility with your healthcare provider can help rule out any other underlying conditions.\n\n## Lifestyle Adjustments\nGiven your current situation, here are some adjustments you might consider:\n- **Start Slow**: Begin with low-intensity exercises and gradually increase the duration and intensity to see what your body can handle.\n- **Consult a Physical Therapist**: A physical therapist can help design an exercise program tailored to your capabilities and needs.\n- **Nutritional Advice**: Consult with a dietitian to ensure you are getting the right nutrients to support your energy levels and overall health.\n\nBy addressing these factors comprehensively, you may be able to find ways to improve your energy levels and physical performance."

Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the recent use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) at the dentist, there are several potential explanations and concerns to consider:\n\n## Nitrous Oxide Effects\nNitrous oxide can have significant short-term and long-term effects, especially if used inappropriately or in large quantities.\n\n### Immediate and Short-Term Effects\n- The immediate effects of nitrous oxide can include euphoria, dizziness, headache, and lack of coordination. However, your experience of severe nausea, faintness, and inability to move or speak the next day suggests a more severe reaction[4][5].\n- Hyperventilating, seizure-like movements, and inability to move or speak could be indicative of an adverse reaction to the nitrous oxide, possibly due to oxygen displacement or other factors[5].\n\n### Long-Term and Repeated Use Effects\n- Although you only used it once, the symptoms you're experiencing could be related to the acute effects of nitrous oxide. However, regular or excessive use of nitrous oxide can lead to vitamin B12 depletion, which can cause neurological symptoms such as numbness, weakness, and cognitive impairments. While this is less likely given your single use, it's worth noting[2][4][5].\n\n## Seizure-Like Episodes\n- The seizure-like movements and your inability to move or speak could suggest a neurological event. However, the ER tests (bloods, EKG, and head CT) came back clear, making a traditional seizure less likely. The doctor's suggestion that it could be a bad reaction to the laughing gas is plausible[5].\n\n## \"Freezing\" Episodes\n- The daily \"freezing\" episodes where you are unable to speak or move, along with difficulty processing information and \"lags\" in responding, could be indicative of a transient neurological issue triggered by the nitrous oxide. These symptoms resemble those of absence seizures or other neurological disturbances, but the lack of a clear diagnosis from the ER tests means further evaluation is needed[3][5].\n\n## Neurological Consultation\nGiven the complexity and severity of your symptoms, it is crucial that you follow through with the neurologist appointment. The neurologist can conduct more detailed tests, such as an EEG, to evaluate your brain activity and determine if there are any underlying neurological conditions that need to be addressed.\n\n### Key Considerations\n- Ensure you provide the neurologist with a detailed account of your symptoms and the timing of your nitrous oxide use.\n- Discuss any potential interactions between the nitrous oxide and any other medications or conditions you may have.\n- Follow any recommendations or further testing advised by the neurologist to determine the cause and appropriate treatment for your symptoms.\n\nIn summary, while the immediate reaction could be attributed to the nitrous oxide, the ongoing neurological symptoms warrant a thorough neurological evaluation to rule out other conditions and ensure proper management."

        "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Birth asphyxia, which involves a lack of oxygen during the birthing process, can have significant and long-lasting effects on a child's health and development. Here are some key points that might help you understand the potential connections between your birth asphyxia and your current conditions:\n\n## Immediate and Short-Term Effects\n- Birth asphyxia can lead to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a brain injury caused by lack of oxygen and blood flow. Immediate signs of HIE include neonatal seizures, hypotonia (limp and floppy body), poor feeding, depressed level of consciousness, multiple organ problems, and poor brain stem reflexes such as breathing difficulties and abnormal responses to light[1][5].\n\n## Long-Term Effects\n- Children who experience severe birth asphyxia and subsequent HIE can develop a range of long-term conditions. These include cerebral palsy, epilepsy and seizure disorders, developmental delays, speech delays, learning disabilities, behavioral and emotional disorders, hearing and visual impairments, feeding problems, and various other physical and cognitive disabilities[1][3][5].\n\n## Connection to ADHD\n- There is evidence suggesting that birth asphyxia and other ischemic-hypoxic conditions can increase the risk of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A study found that children who experienced birth asphyxia had a 26% greater risk of developing ADHD[2].\n\n## Sensitivity to Strong Flashing Lights\n- The sensitivity to strong flashing lights could be related to the neurological impacts of birth asphyxia. HIE can affect various parts of the brain, including those responsible for sensory processing. Abnormal responses to light are among the short-term signs of HIE, and some children may continue to experience sensory sensitivities as they grow[1][5].\n\n## Seizures and Neurological Issues\n- Birth asphyxia is a common cause of neonatal seizures, and these seizures can further exacerbate brain injury if not promptly treated. While you may not have ongoing seizures, the initial brain injury could have long-term effects on your neurological and cognitive functions[1][5].\n\n## Treatment and Outcomes\n- Early intervention, such as therapeutic hypothermia (cooling therapy), can help reduce the severity of brain damage caused by birth asphyxia. It is positive that you received cooling therapy, as this is a recommended treatment for HIE and can help minimize long-term effects[5].\n\nGiven your history of birth asphyxia and the subsequent cooling therapy, it is plausible that some of your current conditions, such as ADHD, could be linked to the birth asphyxia. However, a definitive diagnosis and understanding of the causal relationships would require a comprehensive medical evaluation by a healthcare professional who can review your full medical history and current symptoms."

        "question": "Age \u2013 25 Sex \u2013 Male Height - 183cm 6ft Weight - 92kg 200lb Race \u2013 Caucasian Duration - Last 3 months Symptoms ive experienced over the last 3 months Around 2months ago i was experiencing Phantom smells, brief periods of 3-4second smells; started off as a blood smell and then startedto get them more frequently and smells were sometimes oranges/flowers. I Have since had an EEG that said i had no Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. I've not had these smells for a few weeks in the last 2 weeks i have started to notice eye floaters that follow where my eye goes only in sunlight. I have also noticed Bright flashing lights from the outter right corner of my eye. Some less worrying symptoms i have had. Sometimes 1 ear will get a high pitch noise that starts loud and fades out Muscle twitching hadaches sometimes. nothing severe Lightheadedness that may be related to anxiety/ or my low iron Sometimes cant think of the word i was thinking of or lose train of thought.

Is it possible that stress can do all these things to the body... my GP dosent seem worried about brain tumours but i am.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and the context provided, it's important to consider several potential causes and the interplay between physical and psychological factors.\n\n## Phantom Smells (Phantosmia)\nPhantosmia, or olfactory hallucinations, can be caused by a variety of factors including nasal or sinus issues, neurological conditions, and even psychological stress. However, since your EEG ruled out temporal lobe epilepsy, other causes need to be considered. Phantosmia can also be a result of upper respiratory infections, allergies, or even post-viral conditions like those following a COVID-19 infection[1][4].\n\n## Eye Floaters and Flashes\nThe recent onset of eye floaters and bright flashing lights, particularly noticeable in sunlight, suggests changes in the vitreous gel of your eyes. This is often due to a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), a common age-related change, but it can also indicate more serious conditions like retinal tears or retinal detachment. These symptoms warrant an immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist to rule out any serious eye conditions[2][3].\n\n## Other Symptoms\n- **High Pitch Noise in One Ear**: This could be related to stress, anxiety, or even a minor ear condition.\n- **Muscle Twitching and Headaches**: These can be symptoms of stress, anxiety, or low iron levels.\n- **Lightheadedness**: This could be related to anxiety, low iron levels, or other factors.\n- **Cognitive Symptoms**: Difficulty thinking of words or losing train of thought can be related to stress, anxiety, or depression.\n- **Decaying Tooth**: Dental issues can contribute to overall discomfort and stress but are not directly related to your other symptoms.\n\n## Stress and Anxiety\nWhile stress and anxiety can exacerbate many physical symptoms, they are unlikely to be the sole cause of all the symptoms you're experiencing, especially the visual disturbances. However, it's clear that your recent high-stress period could be contributing to some of your symptoms, such as headaches, muscle twitching, and cognitive difficulties.\n\n## Brain Tumors\nYour GP does not seem worried about brain tumors, but given the combination of your symptoms, it is prudent to ensure all possible causes are ruled out. Phantosmia can sometimes be a sign of a brain-related condition, although this is less common. The absence of temporal lobe epilepsy on your EEG is reassuring but does not entirely rule out other neurological issues. If you remain concerned, it may be worth discussing further neurological evaluation with your GP or a specialist.\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Ophthalmological Evaluation**: Given the eye floaters and flashing lights, an immediate appointment with an ophthalmologist is crucial to assess for any retinal issues.\n- **Neurological Follow-Up**: If your GP is not concerned about brain tumors but you still have doubts, consider asking for a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation.\n- **Dental Care**: Addressing your dental issue can help reduce overall stress and discomfort.\n- **Mental Health Support**: Continuing to manage your anxiety and depression through therapy or counseling can help alleviate some of the symptoms related to stress.\n\nBy addressing each of these areas, you can better understand the underlying causes of your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment."

        "question": "Recently I got a hickie, and tons of people started telling me to be careful because I could die, and stuff. Is it that dangerous? Male 17, epilepsy, anxiety, question: are hickies dangerous?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While hickeys are generally not dangerous, there are some rare and serious potential complications you should be aware of, especially given your health conditions.\n\n### General Risks\n- Hickeys are essentially superficial bruises caused by the rupture of small blood vessels under the skin due to intense suction. They usually heal on their own within a few days to two weeks and are not typically a cause for concern[1][5].\n\n### Rare but Serious Complications\n- There have been extremely rare cases where hickeys have led to more serious health issues, such as strokes. This can happen if the hickey is applied near a major blood vessel, like the carotid artery in the neck, which can cause a blood clot to form or dislodge an existing clot. This clot can then travel to the brain, resulting in a stroke. There have been documented cases, including a New Zealand woman who suffered a non-fatal stroke and a 17-year-old boy in Mexico who died from a stroke after receiving a hickey[1][2][5].\n\n### Considerations for Your Health Conditions\n- **Epilepsy**: While there is no direct link between hickeys and epilepsy, it is crucial to be aware of any unusual symptoms. If you experience any sudden or unexplained neurological symptoms, such as convulsions or loss of movement, after receiving a hickey, seek medical attention immediately.\n- **Anxiety**: The emotional stress of worrying about potential complications can exacerbate anxiety. However, the physical act of receiving a hickey does not directly impact anxiety.\n\n### When to Seek Medical Attention\n- If your hickey does not go away after a couple of weeks, becomes very sore, or if you notice other unexplained bruises.\n- If you experience any neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or paralysis.\n- If there is a lump over the bruise or any other unusual symptoms[1].\n\nIn summary, while the risk of serious complications from a hickey is extremely low, it is important to be cautious, especially if the hickey is applied near major blood vessels. Given your health conditions, it is always best to err on the side of caution and monitor your symptoms closely. If you have any concerns or notice any unusual symptoms, consult a healthcare professional."

Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medical history, there are several factors you should consider and discuss with your doctor to ensure you are addressing any potential serious issues.\n\n## Lightheadedness and Fatigue\n- These symptoms could be related to various factors including your existing conditions (epilepsy, ADHD, endometriosis), medications, or new health issues. It is crucial to rule out any underlying conditions that might be exacerbating these symptoms. For instance, iron deficiency, as you mentioned in the past, or other nutritional deficiencies could be contributing factors[1][3].\n\n## Darker Urine\n- Despite your high water intake, darker urine could indicate dehydration or other issues such as liver or kidney problems. It is important to have your urine and possibly liver and kidney functions checked[3].\n\n## Light Periods\n- Significant changes in menstrual flow, especially if accompanied by other symptoms like pelvic pain or ovarian cyst issues, should be evaluated. This could be related to the ovarian cyst, endometriosis, or hormonal imbalances. It is also important to rule out any other gynecological issues, including the possibility of ovarian torsion or cyst rupture, especially given the increased pain from your ovarian cyst[2][4].\n\n## Ovarian Pain\n- The increased pain from your 5cm ovarian cyst, particularly if it is tender and hurts during stretching or exercises, is a concern. It is essential to monitor whether the cyst is causing any complications such as twisting or rupture. Regular ultrasound checks and consultations with a gynecologist are recommended to manage this condition effectively[2][4].\n\n## Flu-like Symptoms\n- Recurring flu-like symptoms could be due to various reasons including infections, seasonal changes, or other underlying health issues. Given your recent move to a Nordic country and the change in seasons, it might be related to vitamin D deficiency or seasonal affective disorder, which you are partially addressing with Vitamin D and a therapy lamp. However, persistent symptoms warrant medical evaluation to rule out any serious infections or other conditions[3][5].\n\n## Demotivation and Depression\n- While demotivation and weepiness can be related to depression or the change in environment, it is also important to consider whether these symptoms are being exacerbated by physical health issues. Ensuring that your mental health is supported while investigating the physical aspects is crucial.\n\n### When to See the Doctor\n- Given the combination and severity of your symptoms, it would be wise to schedule an appointment with your doctor:\n  - **Immediate Concerns**: Sudden severe pelvic pain, vomiting, or nausea accompanied by abdominal pain should prompt an urgent visit.\n  - **Ongoing Symptoms**: Persistent lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods, and increased ovarian pain should be evaluated as soon as possible.\n  - **Routine Monitoring**: Regular check-ups for your ovarian cyst and endometriosis are important to manage these conditions effectively.\n\n### Additional Tests and Evaluations\n- Urine tests to check for dehydration or other urinary issues.\n- Blood tests to evaluate liver and kidney functions, as well as to check for any hormonal imbalances.\n- Ultrasound scans to monitor the ovarian cyst.\n- Consultations with a gynecologist to assess the impact of the ovarian cyst and endometriosis on your symptoms.\n- Mental health support if depression or demotivation persists.\n\nBy addressing these concerns with your healthcare provider, you can ensure that any underlying issues are identified and managed appropriately."

Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your medical history and the observations you've described, several factors could be contributing to your post-surgical hyperactivity and reduced sensitivity to anesthesia and pain medications.\n\n## Anesthesia and Surgical Response\n- Your reaction to anesthesia, characterized by hyperactivity, rapid speech, and giggling upon waking, could be related to the interactions between the anesthetic agents and your existing medications or health conditions. Anesthetic agents can have varied effects depending on individual physiology and the presence of other medications[2][4].\n- The need for extra anesthetic at the dentist suggests you may have a higher tolerance or resistance to certain anesthetics, which could be influenced by your use of medications like Lamotrigine and Sertraline, or your neurological conditions.\n\n## Medications and Health Conditions\n- **Lamotrigine**: This medication is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It can affect how anesthetics work, potentially leading to altered responses during and after surgery[4].\n- **Sertraline**: An SSRI, which can influence various physiological responses, including those related to anesthesia. SSRIs can also interact with anesthetics and other medications, affecting their efficacy and side effects[4].\n- **ADHD**: Patients with ADHD may have different responses to anesthesia and postoperative care. Research suggests that individuals with ADHD may experience higher rates of post-operative complications and unique behavioral responses, such as the hyperactivity you described[5].\n- **Tourette\u2019s Syndrome**: This condition can impact how patients respond to sedation and anesthesia. The use of certain anesthetics might need to be carefully managed to avoid exacerbating tics or other symptoms[2].\n- **Epilepsy**: The chronic use of anticonvulsants like Lamotrigine can affect anesthesia and recovery. These medications might prolong the effects of anesthesia or alter the body's response to anesthetics[4].\n\n## Pain Sensitivity\n- Your reduced sensitivity to pain medications like codeine could be due to several factors, including your neurological conditions or the chronic use of certain medications. Some individuals develop tolerance to opioids, which might explain why codeine is ineffective for you.\n\n## Recommendations\n- It would be beneficial to discuss your detailed medical history and previous surgical experiences with your anesthesiologist before any future surgeries. This can help in tailoring the anesthetic plan to your specific needs and minimizing any adverse reactions.\n- Inform your healthcare providers about your medications and any changes in your health status to ensure that these factors are considered during preoperative evaluation and perioperative care.\n\nBy understanding the interactions between your medications, health conditions, and anesthesia, healthcare providers can better manage your care to achieve a safer and more comfortable surgical experience."

        "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your symptoms and medication history, here are some potential factors and considerations:\n\n## Keppra (Levetiracetam) Side Effects\n- Keppra can cause a variety of gastrointestinal side effects, including stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms can be exacerbated by other factors such as diet and other medications[1][4].\n- Other common side effects of Keppra include changes in mood, anxiety, irritability, and restlessness, which could be contributing to your anxiety attacks[1][4].\n\n## Amitriptyline Withdrawal\n- Although you've been off amitriptyline for a week and the withdrawal symptoms are easing, some symptoms like chills and shakes can persist. However, gastrointestinal issues are not typically highlighted as common withdrawal symptoms from amitriptyline[3].\n\n## Other Medications and Conditions\n- Your use of Ventolin inhalers for asthma is unlikely to be directly related to your gastrointestinal symptoms.\n- Paracetamol (acetaminophen) used for migraines is generally well-tolerated and not likely to cause the gastrointestinal symptoms you're describing.\n\n## Specific Symptoms\n- The recurring stomach pain, feeling of needing to use the bathroom constantly, and stomach gurgling could be related to several factors:\n  - **Gastrointestinal Side Effects of Keppra**: As mentioned, these are common side effects of levetiracetam[1][4].\n  - **Dietary Changes**: Your previous success with avoiding sodas and spicy foods and drinking decaffeinated green tea with honey suggests that dietary factors could be influencing your symptoms.\n  - **Irregular Periods**: Your menstrual irregularity could be a separate issue, but hormonal changes can sometimes affect gastrointestinal comfort.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: Given the recurrence of your symptoms and the potential interactions between your medications and other health conditions, it is crucial to discuss these issues with your healthcare provider. They can help determine if your symptoms are related to Keppra or another factor.\n- **Monitor and Adjust Diet**: Continue to monitor the impact of your diet on your symptoms. Avoid foods that exacerbate your condition.\n- **Address Anxiety**: Since anxiety attacks are part of your symptoms, managing stress through counseling, relaxation techniques, or other stress-reduction methods might be helpful.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Blood Work and Physical Exam**: Your doctor may recommend blood tests to check for any underlying conditions such as liver or kidney issues, which can sometimes be associated with long-term use of medications like Keppra[2][4].\n- **Alternative Medications**: If your doctor determines that Keppra is the cause of your symptoms, they might consider alternative anti-epileptic medications.\n\nIt is essential to discuss all these factors with your healthcare provider to get a comprehensive understanding and management plan for your symptoms."

        "answer": "Grey matter heterotopia (GMH) is a neurological disorder characterized by the abnormal location of gray matter in the brain, typically within areas that should be occupied by white matter. Here are some key points and options that might help clarify the situation for your coworker's daughter:\n\n## Causes and Development\n- GMH results from an interruption in the migration of neurons to the cerebral cortex during fetal development. This can be due to genetic mutations, such as those in the X-linked _FLNA_ gene, or epigenetic factors like perinatal stressors[4].\n\n## Symptoms\n- The most common symptoms include epileptic seizures, which can range from mild to severe. Other symptoms may include intellectual disability, developmental delays, and various neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, mood instability, and behavioral issues[1][3][4].\n\n## Types of Heterotopia\n- There are different types of GMH, including nodular (subependymal and subcortical) and diffuse (band heterotopia). Band heterotopia, also known as double cortex syndrome, is seen exclusively in women due to the genetic nature of the condition[1].\n\n## Diagnosis\n- Diagnosis is typically made through brain imaging, most commonly MRI or CT scans. The pathognomonic finding is the presence of heterotopic gray matter abnormally located within areas of white matter[1][3][5].\n\n## Treatment\n- **Medical Management**: Anticonvulsive medications are often prescribed to manage seizures, but these are frequently ineffective in fully controlling the seizures[2][5].\n- **Surgical Options**: Surgery is a common treatment for pharmacoresistant epilepsy associated with GMH. Techniques include:\n  - Stereotactic destruction of small heterotopic nodes\n  - Radiofrequency thermocoagulation ablation\n  - Laser interstitial thermal ablation (MRgLITT)\n  - Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)\n  - MR-guided focused ultrasound therapy (though less commonly used due to its limitations)\n  - Removal of the heterotopic focus with local resection of the normotopic part of the cerebral cortex[2][5].\n\n## Post-Surgical Care\n- After surgery, patients may require anti-seizure medications, sedatives, and other supportive therapies such as physical therapy, dietary adjustments, and mental health therapy. Activities like yoga, aerobic exercises, and art therapy can also be beneficial[5].\n\n## Prognosis\n- The condition is generally fixed in terms of its occurrence and symptoms, meaning it does not tend to progress over time. However, surgical interventions can provide relief from seizures, although they cannot reverse developmental disabilities[1].\n\n## Specific Considerations for Your Coworker's Daughter\n- Given her age and the presence of seizures, it is crucial to manage her condition effectively. The wait until October for a detailed discussion with the doctor can be challenging, but in the meantime, ensuring she adheres to any prescribed medication and follows up with regular neurological check-ups is important.\n- Parents can also prepare by asking detailed questions about the type of GMH, the severity of the condition, and the potential surgical and non-surgical treatment options available.\n- Emphasizing the importance of a supportive environment, both at home and at school, can also help in managing her condition and overall well-being.\n\nBy understanding these aspects, your coworker and her family can better navigate the diagnosis and treatment process, and you can offer more informed support during this challenging time."

        "question": "25F, 200lb, 5\u20194, asthma, current medications wellbutrin SR, vyvanse, lexapro, montelukast, spironolactone. i do not drink any alcohol, use cannabis 5-7x a weekOccasionally, I will have an intense sensation of deja vu, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as disoriented. It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",

        "answer": "The experiences you are describing, which include intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu followed by sensations of disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and confusion, can be analyzed from several perspectives based on the available information.\n\n### D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and Associated Sensations\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu itself is a common phenomenon that most people experience at some point in their lives. It is characterized by a false sense of familiarity, as if a current situation has been experienced before, even though it has not[1][3][5].\n\nThe additional sensations you described, such as intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, are not typical of ordinary d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences. These symptoms suggest there might be an underlying neurological or other health-related issue.\n\n### Neurological Considerations\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can sometimes be associated with neurological disorders, particularly those involving the temporal lobe, such as temporal lobe epilepsy. Focal seizures in the temporal lobe can cause sensations similar to what you described, including disorientation and confusion. However, these seizures are usually brief and may not be immediately recognized as such[1][3][5].\n\n### Influence of Medications and Other Factors\n\nGiven your current medications (Wellbutrin SR, Vyvanse, Lexapro, montelukast, and spironolactone), it's possible that these could be contributing to your symptoms. Certain medications can affect brain function and may increase the frequency or intensity of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences.\n\n- **Wellbutrin SR** and **Vyvanse**: These medications, particularly those affecting dopamine and norepinephrine levels, can sometimes cause neurological side effects.\n- **Lexapro**: While generally well-tolerated, SSRIs like Lexapro can occasionally lead to cognitive or sensory disturbances.\n- **Montelukast** and **spironolactone**: These are less likely to cause neurological symptoms directly but should be considered in a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n### Cannabis Use\n\nYour frequent use of cannabis could also be a factor. Cannabis can alter perception and memory processes, potentially exacerbating or contributing to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the associated disorienting sensations.\n\n### Control and Dream Recall\n\nYour ability to sometimes \"control\" the progression of these sensations when you were younger, and your vivid dream recall, suggest a complex interplay between your brain's memory and perception systems. This could be related to the theories of memory recall and implicit memory, where your brain recognizes similarities between current and past (even forgotten) experiences[5].\n\n### Recommendations\n\nGiven the complexity and intensity of your symptoms, it would be prudent to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist or a psychiatrist, to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. **Detailed Medical History**: Share your full medical history, including all medications and substance use.\n2. **Neurological Evaluation**: Undergo a thorough neurological examination to check for any signs of seizure disorders or other neurological conditions.\n3. **Adjust Medications**: Discuss the possibility of adjusting your medications to see if this alleviates the symptoms.\n4. **Lifestyle Changes**: Consider reducing or stopping cannabis use to see if this impacts the frequency or intensity of your symptoms.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can better understand the underlying causes of your experiences and find appropriate management strategies."

        "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your history of GERD due to a hiatal hernia and the specific symptoms you experience after weight lifting or working out, there are several factors to consider that might explain your light-headedness and passing out episodes.\n\n## Hiatal Hernia and Exercise\nExercises that increase abdominal pressure, such as weight lifting, can exacerbate symptoms of a hiatal hernia, including acid reflux and discomfort. High-impact activities and those that involve bending or lying flat can worsen the condition[1][5].\n\n## Vagus Nerve Stimulation\nWhile the vagus nerve is involved in various physiological processes, including heart rate and digestion, direct stimulation of the vagus nerve by weight lifting is unlikely. However, the increased abdominal pressure from weight lifting could indirectly affect vagal tone.\n\n## Potential Mechanisms\n- **Increased Abdominal Pressure**: Weight lifting can significantly increase intra-abdominal pressure, which may worsen hiatal hernia symptoms, including acid reflux and chest pain. This increased pressure could potentially affect the diaphragm and indirectly influence the vagus nerve, although this is more of an indirect effect rather than a direct stimulation[1][5].\n- **Reduced Blood Flow**: The increased pressure and straining during weight lifting might reduce blood flow to the brain temporarily, leading to light-headedness or fainting.\n- **Gastroesophageal Reflux**: GERD symptoms can be triggered or worsened by exercise, particularly if it involves heavy lifting or high-impact activities. This could lead to discomfort and potentially affect your overall physiological state during and after exercise.\n\n## Medical Consultation\nGiven the conflicting diagnoses and the lack of clear explanations from previous tests, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the interplay between your hiatal hernia, GERD, and exercise-induced symptoms. They may recommend:\n- **Modified Exercise Routine**: Switching to low-impact exercises such as walking, cycling, or gentle yoga that do not exacerbate your hiatal hernia symptoms[1][5].\n- **Monitoring**: Closely monitoring your symptoms during and after exercise to identify any patterns or triggers.\n- **alternative Diagnostics**: Further diagnostic tests to rule out other conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n## PPIs and GERD\nThe long-term use of PPIs for GERD management is important, but it does not address the underlying mechanical issue of the hiatal hernia. Your healthcare provider should also consider whether the current management of your GERD is optimal and if any adjustments are needed, especially in the context of your exercise routine.\n\nIn summary, while weight lifting is unlikely to directly stimulate the vagus nerve, the increased abdominal pressure and exacerbation of hiatal hernia symptoms could contribute to your light-headedness and passing out episodes. Consulting with a healthcare provider to adjust your exercise routine and manage your GERD symptoms more effectively is essential."

        "question": "29F, height 165cm, weight 74kg, caucasian. I do not smoke or have regular dairy. Weekly alcohol consumption would be 2-7 standard drinks per week at most.  also regularly have lean meat and 3 veg for lunch and dinner and a fruit smoothie for breakfast. Current diagnoses: epilepsy, mild chronic pancreatitis Regular medications are: AM: 500mg Kepra, vitamins D+magnesium PM: 500mg Kepra, vitamin D+magnesium I am awaiting follow-up with a gastroenterologist about why my pancreas could be nibbling on itself (lypase has been found to be between 70-100 on multiple occasions). I have a history of treating my anxiety with alcohol and fast food but over the last 8 years or so (since my early 20's) I've gone to therapy and gotten it really well under control. I never had these symptoms before when I had unhealthy habits but over the last year my pancreas has not been having a good time. Every month or 2 I get these very specific pains that I now know is mild chronic pancreatitis. It's never brought on by a change in routine, it's always random.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your diagnosis of mild chronic pancreatitis and your current dietary habits, here are some key points and recommendations to help manage your condition:\n\n## Diet Recommendations\n\n### Low-Fat Diet\nA low-fat diet is crucial for managing pancreatitis. Aim for no more than 30-50 grams of fat per day. Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean meats, and avoid high-fat foods like fried foods, processed meats, and full-fat dairy products[1][5][3%.\n\n### Lean Proteins and Healthy Foods\nContinue to include lean meats, such as skinless chicken breast, turkey breast, lean fish, and low-fat deli meats, in your diet. Also, focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and lentils, which are naturally low in fat and rich in fiber and antioxidants[2][3][4].\n\n### Cooking Methods\nUse low-fat cooking methods like grilling, baking, broiling, steaming, or poaching. Avoid frying and stir-frying[1][5].\n\n### Meal Frequency\nEating 4-6 small meals throughout the day can be easier on your digestive system and help manage symptoms. This can include snacks like fruits, low-fat yogurt, or lean protein sources[2][3][5].\n\n### Avoid High-Fat and Processed Foods\nAvoid foods high in fat, such as bacon, sausage, fatty cuts of beef and pork, fried foods (like french fries, potato chips), and processed foods (like hot dogs, packaged snacks)[1][2][3].\n\n### Fiber Intake\nWhile fiber is beneficial, some people with chronic pancreatitis may need to avoid very high fiber diets as they can reduce nutrient absorption. Start with low-fiber vegetables and fruits and gradually increase fiber intake as tolerated[2][3].\n\n## Specific Adjustments to Your Current Diet\n\n### Breakfast\nYour fruit smoothie for breakfast is a good start, but ensure it is low in fat. Consider using almond or soy milk and low-fat yogurt.\n\n### Lunch and Dinner\nContinuing with lean meat and three vegetables for lunch and dinner is a good practice. Ensure that the meats are cooked using low-fat methods and avoid adding high-fat sauces or oils.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Alcohol Consumption\nWhile your current alcohol consumption is moderate, it is still important to limit or avoid alcohol altogether, especially if your pancreatitis is exacerbated by alcohol consumption[4].\n\n### Enzyme Supplementation\nIf your gastroenterologist recommends it, taking pancreatic enzymes before each meal and snack can help with digestion and reduce symptoms of malabsorption[4][5].\n\n### Vitamin and Mineral Supplements\nGiven the risk of malnutrition with chronic pancreatitis, continue your vitamin D and magnesium supplements and consider additional vitamins like multivitamins, calcium, iron, folate, vitamin E, vitamin A, and vitamin B12 as recommended by your healthcare provider[4].\n\n## Follow-Up and Personalized Plan\nIt is crucial to follow up with your gastroenterologist to get a personalized diet plan tailored to your specific needs. They can provide guidance on managing your condition effectively and address any nutritional deficiencies or other health concerns[2][4][5].\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines and working closely with your healthcare team, you can better manage your mild chronic pancreatitis and reduce the frequency and severity of your symptoms."
