        "question": "I am a 23 year old male (73 kg 5'9) with no previous history of seizures until I had a seizure 1 month ago and went through all sorts of tests like CT, MRI, Echo test(3 times), Holter test, EEG(3times),Video EEG, Liver Function Test, Multiple blood tests and all came back normal.I was taking anxiety medications and my neurologists are saying i don't have epilepsy and the seizure was the side effect of the meds i took. But now my issue is i feel dizzy or disoriented whenever i play games for half an hour. l didn't have this issue before and I am used to flashing lights (i frequently goes to parties and concerts).I talked about this to my neurologists and they are saying i dont have epilepsy and this probably caused due to eyestrain. But today my screentime was short but when i started playing at night...after half an hour i started feeling disoriented (I play valorant and Apex Legends).l still have anxiety and dissociation issues btw. Any advice is appreciated.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and it's good you're being proactive in trying to figure it out. It's also smart of you to remember what *wasn't* happening before the seizure. Here's a breakdown of advice, considering all you've said, and organized into sections.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end.**\n\n**1. Re-Evaluating the Initial Seizure & Medication Link:**\n\n* **While your neurologists believe the seizure was medication-related, that doesn't *completely* rule out underlying susceptibility.**  Some people have a lower seizure threshold, meaning they\u2019re more prone to seizures even with small triggers. The medication might have been the *precipitating* factor, but not the sole cause.  It's good they've done extensive testing, but it's reasonable to continue gently pushing for further consideration of other possibilities, *especially* given this new symptom.\n* **What was the anxiety medication?** Knowing *which* medication is crucial. Some are far more likely to lower the seizure threshold than others.  Specifically, were you on an SSRI/SNRI, a benzodiazepine, or something else?  Withdrawal from some medications can also trigger symptoms.\n* **Dosage Changes?** Was the medication dose recently changed before the seizure? Even a small adjustment can make a difference.\n* **Polypharmacy:** Were you taking *any* other medications or supplements, even over-the-counter, concurrently with the anxiety medication?  Interactions are common.\n\n\n\n**2. The New Dizziness/Disorientation with Gaming:**\n\nThis is the core of your current concern.  Your neurologists attributing it *solely* to eyestrain feels somewhat dismissive given the timing relative to the seizure, even if they feel confident about the medication being the cause. Here's a more nuanced look:\n\n* **Photosensitive Epilepsy \u2013 Still a Consideration (Even with Normal EEG):**  While your EEGs were normal, they don't *completely* rule out photosensitivity. EEGs capture brain activity at a single point in time.  Intermittent photosensitivity might not show up on a routine EEG.  The flashing lights and rapid visuals in Valorant and Apex Legends *are* potential triggers.\n* **Post-Ictal State (Lingering Effects):**  Even a seemingly \"minor\" seizure can leave subtle changes in brain activity for a period.  It's possible you're experiencing a prolonged or intermittent post-ictal effect, where your brain is still recovering and is more sensitive to stimuli like fast-paced gaming.  This doesn't necessarily mean you have epilepsy, but it means the initial event may have had lasting consequences.\n* **Vestibular Involvement:**  The inner ear (vestibular system) and your vision are closely linked to balance and spatial orientation. Intense gaming, especially fast-paced games, can overstimulate these systems, *particularly* if there's any underlying sensitivity.\n* **Anxiety & Dissociation \u2013 A Powerful Combination:**  Your existing anxiety and dissociation issues are *highly* relevant.  Gaming is stimulating.  If you're anxious or prone to dissociation, the stimulation can overwhelm your system, potentially triggering dizziness, disorientation, or even a feeling resembling a mild seizure.  This can be a vicious cycle \u2013 anxiety makes you more sensitive, gaming triggers anxiety, and so on.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  Less likely, but worth mentioning. Sometimes standing up quickly from a prolonged sitting position (like gaming) can cause a temporary drop in blood pressure, leading to dizziness.\n\n**3. What You Can Do (Actionable Steps):**\n\n* **Detailed Symptom Journal:**  This is *crucial*.  Record *everything* related to the episodes:\n    * **Time of Day:** When do they happen? (e.g., consistently at night?)\n    * **Game Specifics:** Which game?  Are certain maps or game situations worse?\n    * **Duration of Play:**  Exactly how long before symptoms start?\n    * **Symptoms:**  Be precise.  Dizzy? Lightheaded?  Disoriented (how so?  Difficulty focusing? Feeling \"out of it\"? Visual disturbance?) Nausea? Headache?\n    * **Other Factors:**  What did you eat?  How much sleep did you get?  What was your stress level that day?  What medications did you take?\n* **Reduce Gaming Time:**  Seriously.  Cut back *significantly* and gradually reintroduce it, carefully monitoring your symptoms. This is a diagnostic step just as much as a preventative one.\n* **Gaming Environment:**\n    * **Lighting:**  Ensure the room is well-lit, even when playing at night.  Avoid playing in a completely dark room.\n    * **Screen Settings:**  Experiment with brightness, contrast, and color settings. Reduce blue light. Consider using a filter.\n    * **Distance:**  Increase your viewing distance from the screen.\n    * **Breaks:**  Take frequent, mandatory breaks (every 20-30 minutes).  Look away from the screen at a distant object.\n* **Hydration & Nutrition:**  Stay well-hydrated and maintain a stable blood sugar level. Avoid sugary drinks and large meals before gaming.\n* **Stress Management:**  Focus on anxiety reduction techniques.  Meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, mindfulness \u2013 whatever works for you.\n* **Second Opinion:**  If you're not feeling heard by your current neurologists, it's perfectly acceptable and often advisable to seek a second opinion, especially from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy or seizure disorders.\n* **Consider a Neuropsychological Evaluation:**  This type of assessment can help assess cognitive function and identify any subtle deficits that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n* **Discuss with Your Doctor (Psychiatrist/GP):** Revisit your anxiety and dissociation.  Are your current treatments adequate?  Could adjustments to your medication or therapy be helpful?\n\n\n\n**4. When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention:**\n\n* **Any seizure-like activity:**  Even a brief staring spell, muscle twitch, or loss of awareness.\n* **Severe headache:**  Especially if it\u2019s new or different.\n* **Confusion:**  If you\u2019re disoriented for a prolonged period.\n* **Weakness or numbness:**  On one side of your body.\n* **Difficulty speaking:**\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  The fact that your tests were normal is good, but doesn't mean there isn't a problem. Be your own advocate and keep pushing for answers.  \n\n\n\n**To help me refine this advice, could you tell me:**\n\n* **What specific anxiety medication were you taking?**\n* **How long were you on the medication before the seizure?**\n* **Were you taking any other medications or supplements?**\n* **Can you describe the disorientation in more detail? <i>What</i> feels off?** (e.g., spatial disorientation, time distortion, difficulty concentrating, feeling detached from reality)\n\n\n\nI hope this comprehensive response is helpful. Take care, and prioritize your health."

        "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation and it's good you're seeking clarity. Let's break it down, addressing your questions and concerns.  I'm an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses, but I can offer information to help you understand the possibilities and discuss them further with your doctor.\n\n**Understanding Your Experiences**\n\nYou've had two episodes of sudden loss of consciousness with associated symptoms:\n\n* **Episode 1 (2018):**  Collapse in cold water after potential sleep deprivation and minimal alcohol.  Confusion, disorientation to time & place, tongue biting.\n* **Episode 2 (2021):**  Collapse with a scream and head impact after very minimal alcohol and cannabis use.  Confusion, feelings of \"time travel.\"\n\nThese *could* be seizures, but the fact that extensive testing (ECG, X-rays, blood tests, CT scan, MRI, EEG) has consistently come back *normal* is a significant point. That's why this is confusing, for both you and your medical team.\n\n**Does this count as Epilepsy?**\n\nNot necessarily. Epilepsy is generally defined as *two or more unprovoked seizures*.  A \"provoked seizure\" is one brought on by a clear, identifiable trigger (like fever, severe electrolyte imbalance, drug withdrawal).  Your events are\u2026 ambiguous.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n* **Normal Investigations:**  The lack of changes on EEG, MRI, and CT scans is atypical for classic epilepsy.  Epilepsy often (but not always) leaves some visible evidence, even when seizures aren't happening. A normal EEG does *not* completely rule out epilepsy, as seizures can be infrequent and may not be captured during the recording.  However, repeated normal EEGs diminish the likelihood.\n* **Provoked vs. Unprovoked:**  The question is whether these collapses were *unprovoked* or *provoked*. This is the critical distinction. The 2018 event has a possible provocation:  sudden immersion in cold water combined with heat and potentially sleep deprivation/alcohol. The 2021 event is less clear.  The cannabis use is a potential factor, but a couple of puffs is unlikely to be a strong trigger in someone without a pre-existing predisposition.\n* **Dissociative Events:** The descriptions of these events -- particularly the feelings of confusion and \"time travel\" -- also raise the possibility of *non-epileptic events* like psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), or *dissociative episodes*.  These are not due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, but rather to a disruption in how the brain processes information. These can be triggered by stress, emotional trauma, or other psychological factors.  However, a physical trigger could also be present, and it's not always possible to delineate specifically.\n\n\n\n**Why the Lamotrigine?**\n\nYour neurologist likely prescribed lamotrigine as a *preventative measure*.  Even without a definitive diagnosis, they may have felt it was prudent to try and reduce the risk of another event, especially given the potential for injury. Lamotrigine is a relatively well-tolerated anti-epileptic medication.\n\n**Why No Issues for 3 Years *On* Medication?**\n\nThat's a crucial observation!  It could support several possibilities:\n\n* **The Medication is Working:** If it *is* epilepsy, the lamotrigine could be suppressing the subtle electrical abnormalities causing the events.\n* **The Triggers Truly Mattered:**  The events might have been truly provoked by a specific combination of factors, and you've been avoiding those factors during the past 3 years. If you've been consistently getting enough sleep, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding extremes in activity, that could explain the absence of events.  Your description of repeatedly triggering potential epilepsy triggers *after* the first event but *before* medication suggests this is less likely.\n* **Spontaneous Resolution:**  Some conditions can resolve on their own.\n* **Misdiagnosis/Alternative Explanation:** The initial events were something *other* than epilepsy, and you've been on medication unnecessarily.  (This is why continued investigation is important).\n\n\n\n**What Should You Do Now?**\n\n1. **Discuss with your Neurologist (Critical):** You need a detailed discussion with the neurologist who prescribed the lamotrigine.  Specifically:\n    * **Review the Events:**  Again, go over the details of both collapses. Be thorough.\n    * **Question the Diagnosis:** Ask directly:  \"Do you believe this is epilepsy? If not, what other possibilities are you considering?\"\n    * **Medication Review:**  Ask if it\u2019s still necessary to continue the lamotrigine given the lack of events for three years. Discuss potential side effects of long-term medication.  *Do not stop taking the medication without your doctor\u2019s guidance.*\n    * **Further Investigation:**  Ask if additional testing might be warranted. Sometimes, prolonged EEG monitoring (over 24-72 hours) or ambulatory EEG monitoring can capture events that a standard EEG misses.\n    * **Differential Diagnoses:** Ask if they have considered other diagnoses:  Vasovagal syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, migraine with aura, PNES/dissociative events.\n2. **Keep a Detailed Log:**  For the next few weeks (or months), keep a meticulous log of:\n    * **Sleep:**  Hours of sleep, quality of sleep.\n    * **Diet:** What you eat and drink.\n    * **Stress Levels:** Rate your stress on a scale of 1-10.\n    * **Activity Level:** What physical activity are you doing?\n    * **Substance Use:** Alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, any medications.\n    * **Any Potential Triggers:**  Heat exposure, cold exposure, flashing lights, loud noises, strong emotions.\n    * **Any Pre-Event Feelings:**  Do you feel dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous, or experience any unusual sensations before feeling unwell?\n3. **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you're still unsatisfied with the answers you receive, consider getting a second opinion from another neurologist, preferably one specializing in epilepsy or movement disorders.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Head Injury at Age 4:** While you said it had no apparent consequences, it's worth mentioning to your neurologist.  Even minor head injuries can sometimes have subtle long-term effects.\n* **Your Athleticism:** Your excellent physical fitness is a positive factor.\n* **Risk of Injury:**  The fact that you've had a head impact during a collapse is concerning.  This underscores the need to understand what's happening and to take appropriate precautions.\n\n\n\n**In summary:** You're in a gray area.  Your events *could* be seizures, but there's not enough evidence to definitively say so. A thorough discussion with your neurologist and potentially a second opinion are essential to clarify the diagnosis and determine the best course of action. Don't self-treat or stop medication without medical advice.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation and requires a **very cautious and thorough approach**.  I'm going to break down my response into sections: understanding the seriousness, potential causes, what you *absolutely* need to do, and why I can't offer a medical diagnosis.  I will *not* include a photo as I'm an AI and cannot ask for or process personally identifiable information like images.\n\n**Please read the Disclaimer at the very end of this response. It is critically important.**\n\n**1. Understanding the Seriousness**\n\n* **Chest Pain + Epilepsy + Drug Use = High Concern:**  The combination of chest pain *after* epileptic seizures, especially seizures that occur *during* drug use, is a significant red flag.  This needs immediate and expert medical evaluation. The temporal relationship (chest pain *after* seizures, and seizures *with* drug use) is key information.\n* **Bone Infection and Antibiotics:**  You are already dealing with a serious infection.  Adding epilepsy and chest pain into the mix complicates things considerably.  Antibiotics can have side effects, and it's important to determine if the chest pain could be related to them, but *not* to assume that it is.\n* **Weight:** Your weight of 64kg at 181cm (roughly 5'11\") gives you a BMI of around 19.4, which is considered underweight.  This *could* contribute to vulnerability, but isn\u2019t the primary concern right now.\n\n\n\n**2. Potential Causes (These are *possibilities* \u2013 a doctor must determine the actual cause)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of things a doctor will likely consider.  This is *not* a diagnosis, just to give you an idea of the complexity:\n\n* **Cardiac Issues:** This is a primary concern with chest pain.  Epileptic seizures can sometimes trigger cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) or even, rarely, myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart). Drug use can also *independently* cause heart problems.  The combination is worrisome.\n* **Pulmonary Issues:**  Seizures can sometimes lead to aspiration (inhaling of fluids into the lungs), causing pneumonia or other lung problems. Drug use can also affect the lungs.\n* **Musculoskeletal:** It's possible (but less likely given the connection to seizures) that the chest pain is musculoskeletal \u2013 muscle strain from the seizure activity.\n* **Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity:** Some drugs can directly damage the heart, leading to chest pain and arrhythmias.  This is *highly* dependent on what drugs you've used.\n* **Neurogenic Chest Pain:** Seizures can sometimes cause pain that is referred to the chest, meaning the origin of the pain isn't in the chest itself, but the brain interprets it as chest pain.\n* **Complications from Bone Infection:** While less direct, a severe bone infection *could*, in rare cases, contribute to systemic inflammation that could manifest as chest discomfort, though this is less likely to be directly linked to the seizures.\n* **Esophageal Spasm/Reflux:** Stress and seizures can sometimes worsen esophageal problems leading to chest pain, but again, this is less likely to be the primary explanation given the specifics.\n\n\n\n**3. What You *Absolutely* Need to Do - IMMEDIATELY**\n\n* **Go to the Emergency Room (ER) or call Emergency Services (911 in the US/Canada, 112 in Europe, 999 in the UK):**  Do *not* delay.  This is not something you can wait to see your regular doctor about.  The combination of symptoms requires immediate investigation.  **This is the most important step.** Tell them *everything* about the seizures, the drug use, and the bone infection.\n* **Be Honest About Drug Use:**  I know this can be difficult, but *complete honesty* with the medical team is crucial.  They need to know what substances you\u2019ve used (types, amounts, frequency, and when you last used them) to accurately assess your condition and provide the best treatment.  They are there to help you, not to judge.  Medical professionals are bound by confidentiality.\n* **Describe the Chest Pain in Detail:**  When you get to the ER, be prepared to answer questions about the chest pain:\n    * **Location:**  Where exactly does it hurt?\n    * **Character:**  Is it sharp, dull, crushing, burning, etc.?\n    * **Radiation:**  Does the pain spread to your arm, jaw, back, or elsewhere?\n    * **Timing:** When does it occur in relation to the seizures? How long does it last?\n    * **Severity:**  On a scale of 1-10, how bad is the pain?\n    * **What makes it better or worse?**\n* **List Your Medications:**  Provide a complete list of all medications you are taking, including the antibiotics, dosages, and how often you take them.\n* **Tell Them About the Bone Infection:** Explain that you are being treated for a bone infection and what antibiotics you're receiving.\n\n\n\n\n**4. What to Expect at the ER/Hospital**\n\nThe doctors will likely perform some or all of the following tests:\n\n* **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** To check your heart rhythm.\n* **Blood Tests:** To look for signs of heart damage, infection, and electrolyte imbalances.\n* **Chest X-ray:** To evaluate your lungs and heart.\n* **Cardiac Enzymes:**  Specific blood tests to assess for heart muscle damage.\n* **CT Scan or MRI:**  May be needed to further evaluate the chest and potentially the brain (depending on the seizure characteristics).\n* **Neurological Examination:** To assess your neurological function.\n\n\n\n\n**5. Why I Cannot Provide a Diagnosis**\n\nI am an AI Chatbot, and I am not a medical professional. I cannot:\n\n* **Diagnose your condition:**  Diagnosing requires a physical examination, medical history, and interpretation of diagnostic tests \u2013 all of which I cannot do.\n* **Prescribe medication:**  Only a qualified doctor can prescribe medications.\n* **Provide medical advice:** The information I provide is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

        "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really understandably confusing and scary situation. You're right to be gathering information and thinking critically before accepting a diagnosis and starting medication. It's good you're being proactive! Let's break down your questions about epilepsy diagnosis, EEGs, and the complexities involved.  I will cover quite a bit, but keep in mind I'm an AI and this isn't medical advice \u2013 it's information to help *you* formulate good questions for the neurologist.\n\n**First: The \"Two Seizures\" Rule - It's a Guideline, Not a Hard Rule**\n\nYou are correct that a common saying in neurology is that epilepsy is \u201ctypically\u201d diagnosed after two unprovoked seizures, but this is **not a rigid rule**.  The definition of epilepsy has been evolving. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) actually changed its definition in 2017 and now focuses more on *risk of recurrence* than simply seizure count.\n\nHere's the current thinking:\n\n*   **Epilepsy is now defined as:** A brain disorder characterized by a *lasting predisposition* to generate epileptic seizures.  This means the brain is inherently more likely to have seizures, even if only one has occurred.\n*   **One seizure doesn\u2019t automatically mean epilepsy:** A single seizure can be caused by a lot of things - fever (febrile seizure), sleep deprivation, low sodium, a one-time stress event, a temporary brain irritation, etc.  These are often called \"acute symptomatic seizures.\"\n*   **But one seizure *can* trigger an epilepsy diagnosis:**  If the EEG (explained below) shows evidence of a persistent predisposition to seizures, or if there's evidence of a structural brain problem (which the MRI is looking for), a diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after just one seizure. The neurologist is concerned about the *risk* of another seizure.\n\n\n\n**Second: Understanding EEGs and What They Show (and Don't Show)**\n\nAn EEG (electroencephalogram) measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. It's a crucial tool, but it's also important to understand its limitations.\n\n*   **What an EEG *can* show:**\n    *   **Interictal abnormalities (between seizures):**  These are changes in the brain's electrical activity that are present even when your husband *isn't* having a seizure. These can suggest an increased likelihood of seizures. Common ones include \"spikes\" or \"sharp waves.\"  The *location* and *pattern* of these abnormalities are very important.\n    *   **Ictal abnormalities (during a seizure):**  If a seizure happened during the EEG (typically done by having a patient sleep), the EEG can capture the characteristic electrical discharge of the seizure itself.\n    *   **Epileptiform Discharges:** This is the term for abnormal EEG patterns (like spikes and sharp waves) that strongly suggest a predisposition to seizures.\n*   **What an EEG *can't* show:**\n    *   **Epilepsy is not always visible on EEG:** A *normal* EEG doesn\u2019t rule out epilepsy!  Approximately 20-50% of people with epilepsy will have a normal EEG. Seizures can occur in areas of the brain that are difficult for scalp electrodes to detect, or the electrical activity might be normal between seizures.\n    *   **It doesn\u2019t pinpoint the *cause*:**  The EEG tells you something is happening electrically, but it doesn't say *why* it\u2019s happening. That's where the MRI comes in.\n    *   **It's a snapshot in time:**  An EEG is only recording activity for a relatively short period (usually 20-60 minutes, sometimes longer with overnight monitoring).  Abnormal activity might not be present during that specific time.\n\n**Third: Why the Neurologist Changed Course**\n\nIt sounds like the neurologist initially leaned towards an acute symptomatic seizure.  However, the EEG results changed her assessment. It's likely the EEG showed epileptiform discharges, indicating a higher risk of recurrent seizures.  \n\n**Fourth:  Is There a Specific Electrical Pattern That \"Absolutely\" Means Epilepsy?**\n\nNo. There isn't a single, definitive pattern that says \"epilepsy\" 100% of the time.  Epilepsy is a spectrum of disorders, and the EEG findings are interpreted in the context of the clinical picture (the type of seizure, medical history, MRI results, etc.)\n\nHowever, the presence of frequent, well-defined epileptiform discharges *significantly* increases the likelihood of an epilepsy diagnosis.  Especially if the location of these discharges corresponds to areas of the brain that could potentially cause the type of seizure your husband experienced.\n\n**Fifth: Misdiagnosis \u2013 You're Right to Consider It**\n\nEpilepsy *can* be misdiagnosed. Here are some things that can be mistaken for epilepsy:\n\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These look like seizures but are caused by psychological distress. EEG/video monitoring is usually needed to differentiate.\n*   **Cardiac Arrhythmias:**  Some heart problems can cause loss of consciousness that looks like a seizure.\n*   **Migraines:**  Certain types of migraines can cause neurological symptoms that resemble seizures.\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):**  A mini-stroke can sometimes present with seizure-like activity.\n*   **Syncope (Fainting):**  Simple fainting can sometimes be confused with seizures.\n\n\n\n**Your Questions for the Neurologist (and a few additions):**\n\nYou are absolutely right to have questions! Here are some suggestions:\n\n1.  **\"Can you explain specifically what the EEG showed that led you to diagnose epilepsy?  What type of epileptiform discharges did you see, where were they located, and how frequent were they?\"** (Get specifics \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to ask her to draw a picture if it helps.)\n2.  **\"If the EEG shows epileptiform discharges, what is the likelihood this would be a false positive?\"** (Ask about the specificity of the finding.)\n3.  **\"What does the MRI need to show to rule out a structural cause for the seizure?\"** (Knowing what they are looking for is helpful.)\n4.  **\"Given my husband only had one seizure, and his age, what is the risk of recurrence *without* medication? How do you weigh that risk against the potential side effects of medication?\"** (This is about shared decision-making.)\n5.  **\"What type of epilepsy do you suspect, based on the EEG and the seizure he had?\"** (Understanding the type helps you learn more and understand the treatment plan.)\n6.  **\"Are there any other tests you recommend besides the MRI, such as prolonged EEG monitoring (video EEG)?\"** (Prolonged EEG can be useful to capture more activity.)\n7. **\"Is it possible this could be a fever related seizure or some other singular incident that does not point to epilepsy?\"**\n8. **\"What are the potential side effects of the medication you are recommending, and how will we monitor for those?\"**\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **Take notes during the appointment.**\n*   **Bring a list of your questions.**\n*   **Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for clarification if you don't understand something.**\n*   **Consider getting a second opinion if you are still unsure.**  Especially for a diagnosis of a chronic condition like epilepsy.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed explanation is helpful. You're doing the right thing by educating yourself and advocating for your husband\u2019s health.  The MRI results will hopefully provide more clarity, and a thorough discussion with the neurologist will help you make the best decision about his care.  \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really important question and a common concern for people with epilepsy who want to donate plasma. You're right to question why you were turned away and to seek a more detailed explanation. Here's a breakdown of the reasons, the current guidelines, and what you should consider, geared towards someone in your specific situation (controlled epilepsy, lamotrigine, infrequent seizures).  I'll provide a lot of information, so it's long, but thorough. **Please read the disclaimer at the end as I am not a medical professional.**\n\n**Why Plasma Donation Centers Typically Defer People with Epilepsy**\n\nThe primary concerns stem from both your safety *and* the safety of the recipient of the plasma.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Seizure Risk During/After Donation:**  This is the biggest concern.  Plasma donation involves a relatively significant shift in fluid volume and electrolytes.  This *can* (though doesn't always) lower blood pressure and, in some individuals, could theoretically *increase* the risk of a seizure.  The fear is a seizure happening *during* the donation process (a safety risk for you and staff) or shortly *after* (leading to injury).  This is particularly relevant if your epilepsy isn't perfectly controlled, or if seizure triggers aren't fully identified.  Even with well-controlled epilepsy, there's still a residual risk.\n* **Medication Concerns:** Lamotrigine, like many anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), is processed by the body and present in the plasma. While the amount of lamotrigine in donated plasma is likely very small, plasma-derived products are used to treat a variety of conditions, and the effects of even small amounts of AEDs on recipients isn't always fully known or desirable. The manufacturers of plasma products aim for a clean product without unintended pharmacological effects.\n* **Recipient Safety & Immunological Issues:** Though less common, there is a theoretical concern that donating plasma could trigger an immune response in the recipient, particularly if they have a pre-existing condition.  While epilepsy itself isn't directly immunogenic, the overall health consideration drives caution.\n* **Strict Donor Requirements:** Plasma donation centers generally operate with very conservative donor criteria. They are focused on minimizing *any* potential risk, even if it's small, to protect both donor and recipient. They tend to err on the side of caution.\n* **Liability:** Donation centers want to limit their liability.  A seizure occurring during or after donation could lead to legal complications.\n\n\n\n**Current Guidelines (Generally):**\n\nThe guidelines surrounding epilepsy and plasma donation are *not* standardized and vary between different donation centers (CSL Plasma, Grifols, BioLife, etc.). This is why you were turned away at one center, but it might be different elsewhere.  However, here's a synthesis of common practices and what major organizations say:\n\n* **Generally Deferred:** Most centers *automatically* defer anyone with a history of epilepsy.  The length of deferral varies widely.\n* **Seizure-Free Period:** *If* a center will consider you, a common requirement is a significant seizure-free period.  This is often 6 months to 5 years, but can be longer.  **Your seizure in April 2021 likely means you are still within a deferral period at many centers.**\n* **Medication-Free Period:** Some centers also require a period of being off anti-epileptic medication.  This is *less* common now, as many people require long-term medication, but it still exists.  You are on lamotrigine, so this would automatically rule you out at those centers.\n* **Neurologist's Letter:** *Some* centers will accept a letter from your neurologist stating that your epilepsy is well-controlled, that you are a low risk for seizures during donation, and that they approve of you donating. This is your best avenue to pursue.\n* **Type of Epilepsy:** The type of epilepsy can matter. Generalized seizures (affecting the whole brain) are generally viewed as higher risk than focal seizures (affecting one part of the brain).  However, this isn\u2019t always explicitly stated.\n* **Specific Center Policies:**  Again, each company (and sometimes even individual branches of the same company) can have slightly different policies.\n\n\n\n**Your Specific Situation \u2013 Assessing Your Chances**\n\nYou have several factors working *in your favor*:\n\n* **Long Seizure-Free Period:**  You've had only 5 seizures in almost 20 years, and your last one was over 3 years ago.  This is excellent control.\n* **Well-Controlled Epilepsy:**  The fact that you're on a stable dose of lamotrigine suggests your epilepsy is generally well-managed.\n* **Average Health:** You mention average height and weight, implying no other significant health issues that might further complicate donation.\n\nHowever, the medication is a hurdle.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1. **Call Ahead \u2013 Do Your Research:** *Before* going to a donation center, call several of them (CSL Plasma, Grifols, BioLife, Octapharma are major ones in the US).  Ask specifically about their policy on epilepsy and lamotrigine.  Don't just ask \"Can people with epilepsy donate?\"  Ask, \"I have epilepsy, currently controlled with 450mg of lamotrigine daily. I have been seizure-free since April 2021. Do you have a policy that would prevent me from donating?\"  \n2. **Obtain a Letter from Your Neurologist:**  This is the *most important* step.  Schedule an appointment with your neurologist and explain your desire to donate plasma.  Ask them to write a letter stating:\n    * Your diagnosis of epilepsy.\n    * The type of epilepsy (if known).\n    * That your epilepsy is well-controlled on 450mg of lamotrigine daily.\n    * That you have been seizure-free for over 3 years.\n    * Their professional opinion that you are a low risk for experiencing a seizure during or after plasma donation.\n    * Their approval for you to donate plasma, given your medical history.\n3. **Present the Letter:**  When you go to the donation center, bring the letter from your neurologist. Be prepared to answer questions.\n4. **Be Prepared to Be Deferred:** Even with a letter, some centers may still decline you.  Don't argue; simply thank them for their time and try another center.\n5. **Be Honest:**  Always be honest about your medical history.  Withholding information could put you and the recipient at risk.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **CSL Plasma:** [https://www.cslplasma.com/donor-eligibility](https://www.cslplasma.com/donor-eligibility) (Review their general guidelines, but calling is still essential)\n* **Grifols:** [https://www.grifolsplasma.com/en/donate-plasma/donor-eligibility](https://www.grifolsplasma.com/en/donate-plasma/donor-eligibility)\n* **BioLife:**  (Their website is less specific; calling is highly recommended)  [https://www.biolifeplasma.com/donate-plasma/donor-requirements](https://www.biolifeplasma.com/donate-plasma/donor-requirements)\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. The information provided here is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.  It is essential to consult with your neurologist and the specific plasma donation center to determine your eligibility to donate.  They are the only ones who can make a definitive decision based on your individual medical history and their policies.  This information should not be used to diagnose or treat any medical condition.  Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful. Good luck with your inquiry!  Let me know if you have any other questions."

        "question": "I (27F) had temporal lobe epilepsy from about age 8 until I was 10, when I had surgery to remove the gliosis (and part of my right hippocampus?) that caused my seizures. Every medical questionnaire and intake form I\u2019ve ever had to fill out asks me if I have a history of a seizure disorder and/or epilepsy, and I always check yes and have to explain to whatever professional I\u2019m seeing that I haven\u2019t had a seizure since I had my surgery.I still want to be honest on these forms obviously, but I\u2019m wondering is it even relevant to my current health anymore?As a note, I had my drivers license briefly suspended once when I was 17 or 18 because the DMV found out I\u2019d used to have seizures and needed me to provide a doctors note clearing things up, so it\u2019s important to me to know when it\u2019s actually relevant to divulge my history.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really common and valid question for people who *had* epilepsy but are now seizure-free post-surgery. You're right to be thoughtful about how you answer these questions, balancing honesty with the potential for unnecessary scrutiny. Here's a breakdown, covering medical relevance, legal implications, and how to navigate those forms, along with points relevant to your specific situation (age of onset, surgery type, and your current age):\n\n**1. Is it Relevant to Your Current Health?**\n\nGenerally, *yes, it's still relevant, but the degree of relevance decreases significantly over time, especially with successful surgery and a long seizure-free period.* Here's why:\n\n* **Brain Structure:** Your brain *is* different now than it was before the surgery. Removing part of the hippocampus (which you suspect was part of your surgery \u2013 confirmation from your medical records is ideal, see below) has lasting effects.  Even if you don't have seizures, it can influence things like memory, emotional regulation, and even potentially increase slightly the risk of other neurological conditions later in life (though this is generally small).\n* **Anesthesia/Surgical Risk:**  Future surgeries (even unrelated ones) require your medical team to be aware of your epilepsy history. The anesthesia can interact differently with a brain that has had epilepsy and surgery, and the surgery itself might carry slightly different risks. \n* **Medication Interactions:** Some medications can (rarely) lower the seizure threshold, even if you haven't had a seizure in years.  Awareness of your history helps doctors avoid those.\n* **Differential Diagnosis:** If you *were* to develop a new neurological symptom, your history would be considered as doctors try to determine the cause. \n* **Genetic Predisposition:**  In some cases, epilepsy can have a genetic component. While your surgery addressed the structural cause, knowing your history helps assess any potential family risks.\n\n**However:** and this is *crucial* -  after being seizure-free for 17+ years (27 current age - 10 age of surgery = 17 years), the likelihood of recurrence significantly diminishes, *especially* if the cause was fully removed by surgery.\n\n\n\n**2. Legal Implications & Disclosure (Like the DMV)**\n\nThis is where things get trickier and relate to your experience with the driver's license. You're right to be mindful of this!\n\n* **Driving:**  Regulations vary significantly by state/country. Most jurisdictions have reporting requirements for conditions that could impair driving (like seizures).  The length of seizure-free time required to be eligible for a license varies.  Your experience demonstrates the importance of adhering to those rules.\n* **Insurance:**  Life insurance, health insurance, and potentially even disability insurance companies may ask about medical history.  They *can* use this information to assess risk and potentially adjust premiums or coverage.  With your history, *being honest is vital, but you should be prepared to provide documentation of your long-term seizure freedom*.\n* **Certain Professions:** Professions with significant safety implications (pilot, commercial driver, some first responders, etc.) will always require full disclosure.\n* **Generally:**  Laws surrounding medical privacy and disclosure are complex.  \n\n\n\n**3. Navigating Medical Forms & Conversations**\n\nHere's how to handle those intake forms and conversations:\n\n* **Don't Lie, But Qualify:** Never directly *lie* on a medical form.  Instead of just checking \"Yes\" to \"History of Epilepsy/Seizure Disorder,\" *add a clarifying statement*.  Here are some options:\n    *  \"Yes, history of temporal lobe epilepsy, resolved after surgery at age 10. Seizure-free since surgery.  Documentation available.\"\n    * \"Yes, childhood temporal lobe epilepsy successfully treated with surgery. No seizures for 17+ years.\"\n    * \u201cYes, I was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy as a child and underwent surgery to remove the cause of my seizures, which was successful. I have been seizure-free ever since.\u201d\n* **Be Proactive:** When you see a new doctor, *mention it upfront*.  \"I have a history of epilepsy that was resolved with surgery when I was a child. I haven\u2019t had a seizure in over 17 years, but I want to make sure you're aware of it for my overall medical history.\u201d\n* **Have Documentation Ready:** *This is key*.  Obtain copies of:\n    * **Surgical Report:** Details the procedure, what was removed (confirm hippocampus involvement).\n    * **Neurologist's Letter:** A letter from the neurologist who treated you (or a current one) stating your diagnosis, surgery, and *current* seizure-free status.  Specifically, ask for the letter to state you are considered to be in remission.  This is the gold standard to present to DMVs, insurance companies, etc.\n    * **EEG Reports:**  If you have any post-surgery EEG reports showing normal activity, include those.\n* **Focus on the Present:** After you've disclosed the history, steer the conversation towards your current health concerns.  Don't let it dominate.\n* **If Pressed:** Be prepared to explain the details of your epilepsy, the surgery, and your long-term outcome.  \n\n\n\n**Regarding the Hippocampus:**\n\nThe fact that part of your right hippocampus *may* have been removed is significant. The hippocampus is crucial for memory formation.  If part of it was removed, it might explain any subtle memory differences you've experienced. But many people adapt very well after hippocampal surgery. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Contact Your Neurologist:**  If you haven\u2019t seen a neurologist since shortly after the surgery, schedule an appointment.  They can review your case, provide the necessary documentation, and answer any further questions.\n* **Get a Letter:** Get that official letter stating your seizure-free status and remission. \n* **Keep Records:** Maintain a folder (physical or digital) with all your relevant medical records related to your epilepsy.\n* **Know Your State's Driving Laws:**  Familiarize yourself with the driving regulations in your state regarding seizure disorders.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

I haven't sought treatment yet since these episodes occur infrequently\u2014sometimes just once a year or once every few months.I'm unsure if what I'm experiencing is related to epilepsy or migraines?If anyone has had similar experiences, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're describing symptoms that definitely warrant further investigation, even though they're infrequent. You're right to consider both migraine and epilepsy, as both can present with these types of \"auras.\" Let's break down each possibility, then discuss what you should do next.  I will emphasize I am an AI and *cannot* give medical diagnoses. This is informational only.\n\n**1. Migraine with Aura:**\n\n* **Zigzag Flashes (Visual Aura):** This is *very* common in migraine with aura.  These are often described as shimmering lines, zigzags, spots, or even temporary vision loss. They usually occur *before* the headache, but can sometimes occur *during* or even without a headache.\n* **Headache:** The headache following the visual disturbance sounds typical; often one-sided, throbbing, and moderate in intensity.  But migraines can present with varied headache characteristics (or no headache at all - \"silent migraine\").\n* **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu/Dream Recall:** This is less *classic* for migraine aura, but it *can* happen.  It's considered a type of complex visual aura, sometimes related to temporal lobe involvement during the migraine process.  The anxiety and uncertainty you feel afterwards make sense, as it's disorienting.\n* **Frequency:** The infrequency (once a year to a few times a year) doesn\u2019t rule out migraine.  Some people have infrequent, but debilitating, migraines.\n* **Your Profile:** Your age, sex, weight, and lack of other medical conditions are all consistent with migraine being a possibility.\n\n\n\n**2. Epilepsy (Specifically, Complex Partial Seizures/Focal Onset Aware Seizures):**\n\n* **Visual Disturbances:**  Seizures originating in the occipital lobe (back of the brain, responsible for vision) *can* cause visual disturbances \u2013 flashes, zigzags, distortions. These can be similar to migraine aura, making it tricky to differentiate.\n* **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu/Dreamy State (Often called \"Experiential\"):** This is *highly* suggestive of a temporal lobe seizure. It's a very common type of aura in epilepsy. The feeling of disorientation and anxiety is also typical. The 'dream recall' component aligns well with this.\n* **Frequency:**  Seizures don't *have* to be frequent to be significant.  Infrequent, well-partial seizures (where you remain aware) can still indicate epilepsy.\n* **Your Profile:** While epilepsy can occur at any age, the long duration of your symptoms (a decade) makes exploring this possibility sensible.  The lack of other medical conditions doesn\u2019t rule it out.\n\n**Here's a table summarizing the key differences (but keep in mind overlap is common!):**\n\n| Feature | Migraine with Aura | Epilepsy (Focal Onset Aware) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Visual Aura** | Shimmering, zigzags, spots, vision loss. Usually expands over time. | Can be similar to migraine but may be more abrupt, distorted, or less \"organized.\" |\n| **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu/Dreamy Feeling** | Possible, but less common.  May be part of complex aura. | Common, particularly from temporal lobe origin.  Can feel very strong and disorienting. |\n| **Headache** | Often follows aura, can be moderate to severe, throbbing.  May be absent. | Headache is *not* a typical feature of these seizures, but can occur *after* a seizure (postictal headache).  |\n| **Duration** | Aura usually lasts 5-60 minutes, headache 1-72 hours. | Aura/seizure typically shorter \u2013 seconds to a couple of minutes. |\n| **Post-Event Feelings** | Tiredness, sensitivity to light/sound, possible cognitive difficulties *during* headache. |  Confusion, disorientation, anxiety *after* the event (postictal state). Can feel \"washed out\". |\n\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do Now: (Very Important)**\n\n1. **See a Doctor \u2013 Preferably a Neurologist:**  Do not self-diagnose.  You *must* see a doctor. The best course of action is to consult a neurologist.  Explain your symptoms in detail, including:\n    *   **Frequency:** How often these episodes occur.\n    *   **Duration:** How long the aura lasts, and how long any subsequent headache lasts.\n    *   **Specific Description:** Be as specific as possible about the zigzag flashes (color, pattern, how they move across your vision), and the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu/dreamy feelings (what exactly do they feel like?).\n    *   **Triggers:** Have you noticed anything that seems to bring these episodes on (stress, certain foods, lack of sleep, etc.)?\n    *   **Family History:** Are there any family members with migraine or epilepsy?\n\n2. **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Start *now*.  Record *every* episode, even the minor ones. Note:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   Symptoms (exactly what you experience)\n    *   Duration of each symptom\n    *   Possible triggers\n    *   What you were doing immediately before the episode\n    *   How you felt afterward\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests:**  The neurologist will likely recommend:\n    *   **Neurological Examination:** They\u2019ll test your reflexes, coordination, strength, and sensation.\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This records the electrical activity in your brain.  It's the primary test for diagnosing epilepsy.  It's most useful during or shortly after a seizure, so it may be recommended you do a sleep-deprived EEG or an ambulatory EEG (where you wear the device for 24-72 hours to try and capture an event).  An EEG can sometimes be normal even with epilepsy, so a normal result doesn't necessarily rule it out.\n    *  **MRI of the Brain:**  This imaging test can look for structural abnormalities in the brain that might be causing the symptoms.\n\n4. **Don\u2019t Drive Until Evaluated:** Because of the potential for these to be seizures, you shouldn't drive until you\u2019ve been evaluated by a neurologist and given guidance on driving safety.  Laws regarding driving with epilepsy vary by region.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **It's a process of elimination:**  It may take time to get a diagnosis. Sometimes, it's not clear-cut.\n* **Co-occurrence:** It's possible to have *both* migraine and epilepsy.\n* **Don't minimize your symptoms:**  Even though they are infrequent, they are affecting your quality of life and causing you anxiety.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My partner (20M) has been having these \u2018seizure-like\u2019 behaviours for as long as he can remember (so assuming his whole life). There are 2 separate \u2018actions\u2019 which he isn\u2019t sure are related or not.He is 20, 5\u201d8 and has no other known medical issues other than the ones discussed here. He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019. There are so many times he does it a day that it is hard to pinpoint exactly when an what he is doing when it happens and he is unaware he\u2019s doing it 90% which unfortunately results in nasty comments sometimes when people doing understand why he\u2019s \u2018making weird faces\u2019.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation and it's *really* good you're trying to understand what's going on and advocate for your partner. It's understandable he hasn't sought medical attention if this has been lifelong and feels \"normal\" to him, but it's definitely worth investigating. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, what it *could* be, and crucial next steps.  I'll also address the social aspect at the end.  **Please read the disclaimer at the bottom, as I am not a medical professional.**\n\n**Understanding the Descriptions**\n\nYou've described two key components:\n\n* **Facial Expressions & Tension:**  The exaggerated smiles/pain-like faces combined with tension suggest involuntary muscle movement.  The fact that they are expressive *and* vary points away from a simple, repetitive tic.\n* **Body Vibrations/Shaking:** This is also involuntary, and the intensity being variable (and sometimes felt by you) is significant.  The \"shaking\" aspect is key.\n\n**Possible Explanations (These are possibilities, *not* diagnoses)**\n\nBased on your description, here are several things this *could* potentially be.  It's important to remember that a proper diagnosis requires a medical professional evaluating him:\n\n* **Focal Seizures:** This is the first and most important thing to rule out, given the description of \"seizure-like\" behaviour. *However*, focal seizures present *very* differently. They don't always involve convulsions or loss of consciousness (though they can).  Focal seizures can manifest as:\n    * **Motor symptoms:**  Involuntary movements like twitching, jerking, or sustained muscle contractions (could explain the vibrations and facial expressions).\n    * **Sensory symptoms:**  Though you don't mention these, sometimes focal seizures have sensory components.\n    * **Emotional/Behavioral Changes:**  The altered facial expressions could be related to this.\n    * **Automatisms:**  Repetitive, purposeless movements (the hand squeezing after tasks *could* fit this).  Automatisms often happen with reduced awareness.\n* **Movement Disorder (Less Likely, but Needs Consideration):**\n    * **Dystonia:**  This involves sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. It can be focal (affecting specific areas like the face) or generalized.  The tension and unusual facial expressions could align with this.\n    * **Tremor:**  Though tremors are usually rhythmic, some types can appear as more subtle shaking.\n    * **Myoclonus:**  Sudden, brief, involuntary muscle jerks.  This might explain the vibrations, especially if they are quick and intermittent.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a condition where neurological symptoms (like the shaking and facial expressions) occur without a detectable structural problem in the nervous system.  It's often triggered by stress or psychological factors, but it doesn't mean it's \"all in the head.\" It's a real neurological condition.  The association with intense moments (films, sports) could support this.  The fact it has been lifelong is a little less typical of FND, but not impossible.\n* **Habit/Tic Disorder (Less Likely given intensity and general unawareness):** A complex tic disorder *could* involve facial movements and some body tension but often has a more patterned or suppressible quality. The prolonged periods and intensity you describe make this less likely.\n* **Subtle Form of Tourette's Syndrome:** While typically diagnosed in childhood, it can sometimes present with less obvious tics.\n\n**Why it's crucial to see a doctor, and what to expect:**\n\n* **Ruling Out Seizures is Priority:**  Even if he's used to these, it\u2019s critical to determine if there's underlying seizure activity. Untreated seizures can have long-term consequences.\n* **Neurological Evaluation:**  He needs to see a *neurologist*, not just a general practitioner.  The neurologist will likely do the following:\n    * **Detailed History:**  A very thorough questioning about the events you've described\u2013 when they started, how often they happen, what seems to trigger them, what makes them better or worse, any family history of neurological issues. *Your observations will be incredibly valuable here!*\n    * **Neurological Exam:**  Testing reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, sensation, and mental status.\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  This is the primary test to detect seizure activity.  He may need to wear electrodes on his head for an extended period (even overnight) to capture events if they don't happen during a standard EEG.\n    * **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  This imaging scan can help rule out structural abnormalities in the brain.\n    * **Video-EEG Monitoring:** In some cases, a neurologist may recommend monitoring with both video and EEG to capture and correlate events with brain activity.\n\n\n\n**Addressing the Social Aspect**\n\nThis is really important.  Unsolicited comments from others are unacceptable. Your partner needs strategies to deal with this:\n\n* **Brief Explanation:** He can practice a short, simple explanation he's comfortable with:  \"I have a neurological condition that causes involuntary facial movements.  It's not something I can control, and it's not intentional.\"  He doesn\u2019t owe anyone a detailed explanation.\n* **Assertiveness:** He can respond to rude comments with something like, \"That's not a very kind thing to say,\" or simply ignore them.\n* **You as an Advocate:** If you are present, you can gently but firmly defend him. \"He has a medical condition, and your comment is insensitive.\"\n* **Support Group/Therapy:**  A support group or individual therapy can help him develop coping mechanisms for dealing with social stigma.\n\n\n\n**Important things *you* can do:**\n\n* **Document events:** Keep a journal noting the time, what he was doing immediately before, the specific movements you observed, how long it lasted, and how easily he was brought out of it. This will be hugely helpful to the neurologist.\n* **Encourage him:** This can be scary to face.  Be supportive and reassuring.\n* **Go with him to appointments:** Having someone there who understands can be incredibly helpful.\n* **Don't try to diagnose:**  Let the professionals do that.  Your role is to observe, document, and support.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

I know it's a lot, but getting a proper diagnosis is the most important step.  Please encourage your partner to see a neurologist.  Good luck to you both.\n"

        "question": "I have tc seizures about twice a month or so. I have recently run out of my generic keppra 3 days ago. I will not be able to get a new script for keppra until Monday. I do have my rescue medication (generic Ativan) which I have never had to take before. should I take this every 12 hours like I do my keppra?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a *very* important question, and I'm glad you're asking.  **Absolutely do NOT take your Ativan (lorazepam) proactively every 12 hours like you did with Keppra.**  That is **not** how Ativan is used for seizure management, and could be dangerous.  Here's a breakdown of why, and what you *should* do.  I will also include a **disclaimer** at the end, as I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.\n\n**Why You Shouldn't Take Ativan Regularly Like Keppra:**\n\n* **Different Mechanisms:** Keppra (levetiracetam) is a daily preventative medication. It builds up in your system to *reduce* the likelihood of seizures.  Ativan (lorazepam) is a benzodiazepine, and it works differently. It's a \"rescue\" medication meant to *stop* a seizure that is already happening, or to prevent a cluster of seizures.\n* **Tolerance & Dependence:**  Taking Ativan regularly, even at a low dose, can quickly lead to tolerance (you need more to get the same effect) and physical/psychological dependence.  Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can be very unpleasant and even cause seizures. You stated you've never taken it before, so your body has no tolerance built up.\n* **Side Effects:**  Even short-term, regular use of Ativan can cause significant side effects, including drowsiness, confusion, impaired coordination, and respiratory depression (especially if combined with other medications or alcohol).\n* **Not a Keppra Substitute:**  Ativan will *not* provide the same level of seizure control as Keppra.  Simply stopping a preventative medication and replacing it with a rescue medication is a recipe for increased seizure frequency.\n* **Paradoxical Reactions:** In some people, benzodiazepines can *increase* agitation or even provoke seizures, although this is rare. It is important to know this is a possibility.\n\n**What You *Should* Do (While Waiting for Your Keppra Refill):**\n\n1. **Strictly reserve Ativan for actual seizures:**  *Only* take Ativan if you start having seizure activity.  Follow the instructions *exactly* as given to you by your doctor.  This usually involves taking a specific dose at the *very beginning* of a seizure.\n2. **Prioritize Safety:** This is the most important thing.  Because you're at higher risk for seizures without your Keppra, take extra precautions:\n    * **Avoid driving:** Do not drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or engage in any activity where a seizure could be dangerous.\n    * **Avoid being alone:**  Stay with someone who knows about your condition and what to do if you have a seizure.  If you *must* be alone, tell someone you're off medication and ask them to check on you frequently.\n    * **Avoid triggers:**  If you know things that trigger your seizures (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights), avoid them as much as possible.\n    * **Rest:** Get plenty of sleep and try to manage stress.\n3. **Contact Your Doctor (If Possible):** While you're waiting for Monday, if you're very anxious or concerned, see if you can speak to your doctor or a covering physician. Explain you've run out of medication and are worried about breakthrough seizures. They might be able to offer additional advice or potentially expedite your prescription.\n4. **Go to the Emergency Room (If Necessary):** If you experience a prolonged seizure (one lasting longer than 5 minutes), a series of seizures without regaining consciousness in between, or an injury during a seizure, **go to the nearest emergency room immediately.**\n\n\n\n**Important Information to Review From Your Doctor's Instructions for Ativan:**\n\n* **Dose:**  What specific dose did your doctor prescribe for rescue use? (e.g., 2mg, 4mg)\n* **Route:** How are you supposed to take it? (e.g., by mouth, nasal spray, rectal gel)\n* **When to Use It:**  Specifically, when should you administer the Ativan? (e.g., at the first sign of a seizure, when stiffening begins).\n* **After Administration:** What are you supposed to do *after* you take the Ativan? (e.g., call 911, lie down in a safe place).\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The advice I have provided is based on generally accepted medical practices, but your specific situation may vary.  *Always* follow your doctor's instructions regarding your medications.  **If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.**\n\n\n\n**To reiterate: Do NOT take Ativan proactively. Only use it as directed by your doctor for actual seizure events.**  I hope you get your Keppra refilled quickly, and that you stay safe until then.  Please prioritize your well-being."

        "question": "25MI don't get it. I'm awake and alert in the middle of the day. and everything's fine. I wake up early and my brain says, \"screw you, here's a seizure. Have fun.\"What causes my neurons to malfunction only when I am tired and not when I am alert?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really important question and you're right to push for understanding *why* this is happening. It's frustrating and scary to have seizures seemingly triggered by something as basic as tiredness. Here's a breakdown of the likely reasons, combining neurological explanations, common seizure triggers, and what might be going on in your specific case.  I'll break it down into sections, and then *very importantly* I'll emphasize the need for continued medical follow-up.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**1. The Brain's Excitation/Inhibition Balance & Fatigue**\n\n* **Normal Brain Activity:** Your brain is *always* buzzing with electrical activity, constantly with neurons firing.  This activity is carefully balanced between excitation (neurons firing and sending signals) and inhibition (neurons suppressing signals). This balance is what keeps everything running smoothly.\n* **Fatigue's Impact:** When you're tired, this balance shifts.  Specifically:\n    * **Reduced Inhibition:**  Areas of the brain responsible for inhibition (like those using the neurotransmitter GABA) become less effective when you're sleep-deprived. Think of it like the \"brakes\" on your brain's activity get weaker.\n    * **Increased Excitation:**  Some pathways become *more* excitable when tired.  This is likely a complex interplay of things like adenosine build-up (a chemical that promotes sleepiness but also alters neuronal activity) and changes in other neurotransmitter systems.\n    * **Lower Seizure Threshold:**  Essentially, fatigue lowers your brain's resistance to seizures. It takes less of a disruption to tip the brain over into a seizure state.\n* **Why Alertness Matters:** When you're awake and alert, these inhibitory systems are functioning more optimally. Your brain is better at maintaining stability and suppressing abnormal electrical activity.\n\n\n\n**2. Common Seizure Triggers & How They Relate to Fatigue**\n\nWhile fatigue *is* a trigger, it's rarely the *sole* cause.  There's usually an underlying predisposition. Here's how fatigue interacts with things that can increase seizure risk:\n\n* **Sleep Deprivation:** This is closely tied to your experience.  Chronic or even acute sleep loss has a well-established link to seizures, especially in those already prone to them.\n* **Circadian Rhythm Disruptions:**  Waking up early consistently, and potentially disrupting your natural sleep-wake cycle, could contribute to the problem.  Our brains are very sensitive to regular rhythms.\n* **Stress:** Physical or emotional stress can lower the seizure threshold.  Tiredness often *increases* stress levels, creating a double whammy.\n* **Illness:** Even a mild, unnoticed illness (like a cold) can slightly disrupt brain function and lower seizure threshold, and you might be more susceptible when also tired.\n* **Hormonal fluctuations:** (especially in women) can impact seizure control, and sleep and tiredness impact hormone regulation.\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:** This is the biggest possibility, and what your doctor is likely investigating.\n\n\n\n**3. Potential Underlying Conditions (This is where professional diagnosis is CRITICAL)**\n\nThese are possibilities, *not* diagnoses. Only a neurologist can determine what's happening.\n\n* **Epilepsy:** This is the most common explanation.  It's a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.  There are many different *types* of epilepsy, and some are more strongly linked to sleep disruption than others.\n    * **Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME):**  A common form that often starts in adolescence and is *very* strongly associated with seizures occurring upon waking or shortly after.  This is a high possibility given your description.\n    * **Other Generalized Epilepsies:**  Other types can also have a strong connection to sleep.\n    * **Focal Epilepsy:** Seizures originate in one area of the brain.  These can be more variable in their triggers.\n* **Genetic Predisposition:**  A family history of seizures increases your risk.\n* **Structural Brain Abnormalities:** (rare)  Sometimes, a subtle abnormality in the brain's structure, detectable through an MRI, can contribute to seizures.\n* **Metabolic Issues:** (rare) Certain metabolic disorders can affect brain function and trigger seizures.\n* **Sleep Disorders:**  Conditions like sleep apnea (where you stop breathing during sleep) can lead to oxygen deprivation and trigger seizures.\n\n\n\n\n**4. Why Now? What Changed?**\n\nThink about:\n\n* **Recent Changes in Sleep:** Have you altered your sleep schedule dramatically recently? Even small changes can matter.\n* **Stress Levels:**  Are you under more stress than usual?\n* **Medications:** Have you started or stopped any medications, even over-the-counter ones?\n* **Illness:** Have you been unwell lately?\n* **Diet:** Significant changes in diet can sometimes play a role.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Need To Do (Most Important)**\n\n1. **Neurologist is Essential:**  You *must* be under the care of a neurologist. If you don't have one, *get a referral*.  Describing the timing of your seizures \u2013 occurring specifically when tired, especially upon waking \u2013 is incredibly valuable information for them.\n\n2. **Seizure Diary:**  Keep a detailed seizure diary.  Record:\n    * Date and time\n    * What you were doing right before\n    * How much sleep you had\n    * Your stress level (scale of 1-10)\n    * Any potential triggers (illness, medication changes, etc.)\n    * Detailed description of the seizure itself.\n\n3. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** Your neurologist will likely order an EEG. This test measures your brain's electrical activity and can help identify abnormal patterns and potentially pinpoint the source of the seizures.  Sometimes, a *sleep-deprived EEG* is performed, where you're intentionally kept awake for a period before the test to increase the chance of capturing a seizure.\n\n4. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** An MRI of the brain can help rule out structural abnormalities.\n\n5. **Discuss Medication:** If a diagnosis of epilepsy is made, your neurologist will discuss medication options.  There are many effective anti-seizure medications available.\n\n6. **Sleep Hygiene:**  Even *before* a diagnosis, improving your sleep hygiene is crucial:\n    * **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends.\n    * **Dark, Quiet, Cool Bedroom:** Create a sleep-friendly environment.\n    * **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol Before Bed:** These can disrupt sleep.\n    * **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Take a warm bath, read a book, or listen to calming music.\n\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  The information provided here should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care. You *must* see a neurologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n\n\n**To help me tailor information even more (and again, *this is not a substitute for seeing a doctor*), could you tell me (only if you're comfortable sharing):**\n\n* **Your age and gender?**\n* **Do you have a family history of seizures or epilepsy?**\n* **Have you noticed any other symptoms besides the seizures (e.g., unusual smells or tastes before the seizures, muscle jerks, loss of awareness)?**\n* **How long have you been experiencing these seizures?**\n* **Are you currently taking any medications?**\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed explanation is helpful.  It's good that you're asking these questions and trying to understand what's happening.  Taking proactive steps to investigate and manage this is crucial."

        "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out. I was also having some breakthrough seizures in my sleep.Current meds: escitalopram 15mg q24 (recent increase) lacosamide 200mg q12 gabapentin 400mg q8-12 buspirone 5mg q12 (new) tizanidine 2-4mg before bed celecoxib 100mg q12-24 Vyvanse 30mg as needed (which I did quit for a while to see if it was the culprit. No change)Failed meds: temazepam venlafaxine lorazepam apriprazoleI just want my life back. I\u2019m under the care of a new mental health facility because I felt like the last one wasn\u2019t taking me seriously. Going to work or school is nearly impossible and I cry several times per day along with multiple panic attacks. We\u2019ve considered an IOP or inpatient hospitalization if this isn\u2019t under control soon.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* serious and complex situation. You've been through a profoundly traumatic medical experience with significant consequences, and it's understandable you're desperate to get your life back. It's also good you're advocating for yourself and seeking better care. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, potential areas to focus on, and some suggestions, categorized for clarity.  I will also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.\n\n**Understanding What's Likely Happening**\n\n* **Medical Trauma:** What you experienced *is* medical trauma.  The violation of your pre-agreed care plan, the induced seizures, the loss of time, the dismissive attitude, and the feeling of not being believed are all deeply traumatic. This trauma is directly impacting your psychiatric and neurological symptoms. It\u2019s not \"just\" the epilepsy - it\u2019s the medical betrayal compounding everything.\n* **Exacerbation of Existing Conditions:** Your pre-existing anxiety, depression, CPTSD, and epilepsy have been significantly worsened. The propofol incident likely destabilized your brain, triggering a cascade of effects.\n* **Seizure Activity & Neurological Impact:** Even if the seizures were controlled, a cluster of seizures (especially in the recovery period) can have lingering effects on cognitive function, mood, and sleep. The breakthrough sleep seizures are concerning and need investigation.\n* **Pharmacological Complexity:** You're on a complex medication regimen.  While each medication might be addressing a specific symptom, polypharmacy (taking many medications) can sometimes create its own problems, including side effects and interactions.  The failed meds also suggest finding the right combinations is challenging.\n* **Sleep Disruption:** The 3-3:30 AM awakenings are a classic sign of dysregulated nervous system and potentially related to cortisol spikes stemming from trauma. The wandering/phone use is likely a coping mechanism to distract from overwhelming feelings.\n* **Personality Changes:**  Changes in personality, increased irritability, and mood swings are consistent with both neurological impact from seizures and the emotional toll of trauma.\n\n\n\n**Areas to Focus On \u2013 and Questions to Ask Your Providers**\n\n**1. Neurological Assessment (Needs a *Stronger* Advocate)**\n\nThis is where you're currently getting the most insufficient care, and it needs *urgent* attention.  The indifference from your neurologist\u2019s office is unacceptable.  Consider getting a second opinion, potentially from a epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy).  Specifically, you need:\n\n*   **Comprehensive EEG:**  A prolonged EEG (ideally video-EEG) to assess ongoing seizure activity, even subtle subclinical seizures.  This is crucial *especially* given the sleep seizures.\n*   **Neuropsychological Testing:** Evaluates cognitive function (memory, attention, executive function) to determine if there's been any subtle cognitive impairment from the seizures or the propofol episode.  This can help establish a baseline and track progress.\n*   **MRI Review:**  Ensure a recent MRI of the brain has been done and carefully reviewed for any changes since the incident.\n*   **Detailed Discussion of Propofol Risk:**  You need a thorough, honest discussion about *why* propofol was used despite the known risk, and the potential long-term neurological consequences.\n* **Ask:** \"What specific biomarkers or tests can we do to determine if there is any lasting neurological damage from the seizure cluster I experienced?\"\n*   **Medication Review (Neurology side):**  Is the current combination of lacosamide and gabapentin optimal? Are there alternative anti-epileptic drugs that might be better tolerated or have fewer side effects?\n\n**2. Mental Health Treatment (You\u2019re on the Right Track with the New Facility)**\n\nYour new mental health facility is a positive step.  Focus on trauma-informed care.\n\n*   **Trauma-Focused Therapy:**  EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) are gold standards for processing traumatic memories and reducing their impact.  *This is critical.*\n*   **CPTSD-Specific Treatment:**  CPTSD requires a different approach than \"simple\" PTSD.  The therapist should understand the complexities of attachment trauma and emotional dysregulation.\n*   **Somatic Experiencing:** This therapy focuses on releasing trapped trauma energy in the body. It can be very helpful with the physiological symptoms of anxiety, panic, and sleep disturbance.\n* **Medication Review (Psychiatry side):** Escitalopram and buspirone are reasonable starting points, but given the severity of your symptoms and the lack of complete response, a re-evaluation is needed.  The Tizanidine for sleep might be a band-aid; address the underlying trauma and anxiety first.\n* **Ask:** \"How will you help me process the medical trauma I experienced?  What is your experience treating patients with similar experiences?\"\n\n**3. Sleep Hygiene & Support**\n\n*   **Sleep Study:**  Consider a sleep study to rule out other sleep disorders or to further investigate the breakthrough seizures occurring during sleep.\n*   **Strict Sleep Schedule:**  Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your circadian rhythm.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Dark, quiet, cool bedroom.  Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.  Limit screen time in the evening.\n*   **Mindfulness/Relaxation Techniques:**  Meditation, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation can help calm your nervous system before bed.\n*   **Consider Melatonin (with provider approval):** 0.5-5mg could help regulate sleep.\n\n**4. Address the Chronic Pain**\n\n*   **Integrated Pain Management:**  Chronic pain often exacerbates mental health issues, and vice versa. Explore a multidisciplinary pain management program that includes physical therapy, psychological therapies (like CBT for pain), and potentially interventional procedures (if appropriate).\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations & What to Do NOW**\n\n*   **Documentation:** Keep meticulous records of your symptoms, medications, appointments, and any changes you experience.\n*   **Advocacy:** You may need to be your own advocate.  Bring a support person (your partner) to appointments.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and challenge recommendations.\n*   **Legal Consultation (Optional):**  Given the medical negligence aspect, consider a consultation with a medical malpractice attorney. They can advise you on your legal options.\n* **IOP/Inpatient:** Don\u2019t dismiss these options. If you\u2019re escalating and are functioning at a significantly reduced capacity, they could provide intensive support.\n\n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I have 2 conditions(?) i want to mention, the second being (in my opinion) more severe than the first.the first is something ive noticed more recently. im not sure how long its been going on. i got an apple watch in december, which is the first heart rate tracking device ive owned. ive been using it to occasionally measure my heartrate, and ive noticed that my resting heart rate lies anywhere from 20-50 or 60 bpm lower than my standing heart rate. for a while, immediately upon standing i would become dizzy and my vision would fade a little, and i would see spots. this usually clears up after around 10 seconds 20 seconds at the most. ive seen a lot of resources about pots but i dont and have never fainted or started sweating due to standing the second is something i can give a lot more details on. ive been calling these \"blackouts\" but thats not medically accurate. it usually starts with me feeling unusually sick for a bit, then suddenly, the sickness symptoms will instantly disappear and my hearing will muffle greatly, and my ears will start ringing, but the ringing is also muffled. then, my field of vision will begin to tunnel, gradually getting smaller and smaller, until it becomes completely black, at which point i lose all recollection of what im doing, im basically acting without being conscious.these started when i was 8 and have happened every few years or so since, with them gradually getting worse and worse. the first time it happened, it was just slight lightheadedness and nausea, then muffled hearing and my vision partially tunneling, but not going all the way. this more recent time a little less than 2 years ago, however, i felt extremely nauseous, i felt extremely cold yet i was sweating profusely, i think i might have had a headache too i cant fully remember. i felt like i was gonna die before the \"blackout\" even started and the muffled hearing started. when i fully blacked out and lost consciousness (while still controlling my body, like a zombie in a sense), i have no idea how long i was out for, and i only was brought back to reality when i felt water hit my foot after i knocked over a pitcher.ive done a lot of research on this specifically and the closest thing ive found has been transient ischemic attacks. im not fully sure if this is a tia though, especially because i cant recall weakness in one side of my body at any time during one of these, but that might be because my memory during these events isnt really the best. additionally, my moms biological mom had several strokes before dying of another stroke, which could make me more predisposed to strokes, but again im not entirely sure. ive also gotten results for certain types of epilepsy, but i never looked too deep into them so that may not be validthe reason i bring these two afflictions up together is because maybe im missing something? maybe these are both signs of a rare illness or something? maybe theyre two different things that are co morbid? they may have nothing to do with each other at all though, i just want to include anything i can think of some other things i have are a heat sensitivity (not sure if this is the correct term, but basically i just get really really hot for no reason and cant cool off until i put cold water on my body), as well as sweating a lot, like ill be cold and still sweating. not sure if these have anything to do with the above but im adding it here just in case.if you have any questions feel free to ask, theres something i may have forgotten to add here. also im sorry about the length, i have a tendency to explain things with a lot more words than are needed",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that's a *lot* of information, and you're right to be concerned and to try and connect the dots. It's excellent you've been doing research, but remember I'm an AI and *cannot* diagnose you. What I can do is help you organize this information to present to a doctor and suggest potential avenues for investigation.  Let's break down each element and then talk about connecting them.  I'll try to be thorough.\n\n**First: The Heart Rate Discrepancy**\n\n* **What you're experiencing:** A significant difference (20-60 bpm) between your resting and standing heart rate, accompanied by initial dizziness, faded vision, and spots upon standing.\n* **Why it's concerning:**  This *does* raise a flag for something called **Orthostatic Intolerance**. While you're right to consider POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), orthostatic intolerance is a broader category.  POTS involves a *rapid* increase in heart rate upon standing, but not necessarily *low* resting rates. Other possibilities within orthostatic intolerance include:\n    * **Orthostatic Hypotension:** A significant DROP in blood pressure upon standing. (This can cause dizziness).\n    * **Neurologically Mediated Hypotension (NMH):**  The nervous system doesn't regulate blood pressure effectively upon standing.\n* **What to tell your doctor:** \"I've been monitoring my heart rate with an Apple Watch and noticed a large discrepancy between my resting and standing rates.  My resting rate is consistently [give a typical range] bpm, while my standing rate can be 20-60 bpm lower. I initially experienced dizziness and visual disturbances when standing, though those have lessened somewhat. I want to explore the possibility of orthostatic intolerance.\"\n\n**Second: The \"Blackouts\" (Episodes of Loss of Awareness)**\n\nThis is the more concerning aspect, and your description is very helpful.\n\n* **What you're experiencing:** A pre-episode phase of nausea, feeling unwell, then a startling transition to muffled hearing, ringing, tunneling vision, loss of consciousness (though with continued, automatic movement), and amnesia for the event. A trigger (like water) brought you back. The episodes have increased in severity over time, with more pronounced initial symptoms.\n* **Why it's concerning (and your self-diagnosis efforts):**\n    * **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** You're right to think about this, *especially* given family history. TIAs are sometimes called \"mini-strokes.\" They involve temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. The fact that you *don't* remember weakness is good, but can happen, particularly if the TIA affects areas of the brain not related to motor control.  Amnesia *is* common with TIAs.\n    * **Epilepsy:**  Your past results suggesting epilepsy are worth revisiting.  Not all seizures present the way people think (tonic-clonic convulsions). Some seizures can cause altered awareness, automatisms (repetitive, purposeless movements), and amnesia.\n    * **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a common cause of fainting, but your description sounds *less* typical.  Vasovagal syncope usually involves a slower heart rate *before* a faint, and is often triggered by pain, stress, or prolonged standing. Your symptoms are more abrupt.\n    * **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines can cause visual disturbances and even temporary neurological deficits.  However, the nausea and complete loss of awareness points away from this.\n* **What to tell your doctor:** \"I've been experiencing episodes since childhood that I've been calling 'blackouts,' but that's probably not a correct medical term. They begin with a feeling of illness, which is then replaced by muffled hearing, ringing in my ears, and a narrowing of my vision until I completely lose consciousness.  When I'm 'out,' I continue to move and act somewhat normally, but I have no memory of what I'm doing.  These episodes seem to be getting worse over time, with the last one being particularly frightening.  My family history includes strokes, and I've also had some previous tests suggestive of epilepsy.  I'm concerned these could be TIAs, and I'd like to investigate this further.\"  **Specifically mention the 'automatic' movements during the episodes \u2013 this is important.**\n\n\n\n**Third: Heat Sensitivity & Excessive Sweating**\n\n* **What you're experiencing:**  Feeling overheated easily, difficulty cooling down, and excessive sweating (even when cold).\n* **Why it's potentially relevant:** These could be related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which is involved in regulating body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Autonomic dysfunction can be seen in POTS, other forms of orthostatic intolerance, and some neurological conditions.\n* **What to tell your doctor:** \"I also experience significant heat sensitivity and sweat easily, even when I'm cold. I find it difficult to cool down once I get overheated.\"\n\n**Connecting the Dots & Next Steps**\n\nYou are right to feel that these things *could* be connected. Here\u2019s what I suggest, and why:\n\n1. **See a Doctor! (This is the most important step).**  Specifically, consider seeing a neurologist *first*, given the nature of the \"blackouts,\" but also inform your primary care physician.\n2. **Detailed Timeline:** Bring a detailed timeline of *all* these events:\n    * Dates of each \"blackout\" (as best you can remember).\n    * Detailed description of the pre-episode, episode and post-episode symptoms.\n    * How long you think you were \"out\" each time.\n    * What brought you back to awareness.\n    * Dates you started noticing the heart rate discrepancy.\n    * How often you experience heat sensitivity and sweating.\n3. **Tests to Discuss with Your Doctor:**  Be prepared to discuss these possible tests:\n    * **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Tests your heart's electrical activity.\n    * **Holter Monitor:** A portable ECG that records your heart rate over 24-48 hours.  Good for catching intermittent issues.\n    * **Tilt Table Test:**  This is the gold standard for diagnosing POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance.  It measures your blood pressure and heart rate as you are moved from lying down to standing.\n    * **Neurological Exam:** Assessment of your reflexes, coordination, sensation, etc.\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):**  Tests brain electrical activity (for epilepsy).\n    * **Brain MRI:**  To look for structural abnormalities in the brain (ruling out stroke, tumors, etc.).\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out other potential causes (anemia, thyroid problems, etc.).\n    * **Carotid Ultrasound/Doppler:** To assess blood flow in the arteries of your neck (relevant to TIA risk).\n\n4. **Family History:** Emphasize your family history of stroke.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **Don't self-treat.**  \n* **Document everything.** Keep a log of your symptoms.\n* **Be persistent.**  It may take time to get a diagnosis.\n* **Bring a friend or family member to appointments** to help take notes and advocate for you.\n\n\n\nYou're doing the right thing by gathering information and being proactive.  This is a complex presentation, and it needs a thorough medical evaluation.  I hope this breakdown helps you prepare for a productive conversation with your doctor.

        "question": "18M 72kg/160lbs 180cm healthy non-smoker and non-drinker. My blood pressure normally around 55/110 and my mother has epilepsy. I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this sounds scary, and it's good you're taking it seriously. Let's break down the information and discuss possibilities.  **I must preface this with a very strong disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnosis. This is for informational purposes only, and you *absolutely* need to see a doctor, preferably urgently, to get properly evaluated.**\n\nHere's a thorough look at what's going on, considering your details, and why medical attention is crucial.  I'll cover possible causes, likelihoods, and why your mother's epilepsy is relevant.\n\n**Understanding the Situation:**\n\n* **Loss of Consciousness (Syncope):**  You experienced a transient loss of consciousness, sometimes called fainting or syncope. That's the primary event we need to figure out.\n* **Hyperventilation Trigger:** You mention hyperventilating before passing out.  This is a significant clue.\n* **Motor Activity During Loss:** The description of leg swinging and hand scraping is very important.  This suggests some sort of involuntary movement, which narrows down the possibilities.\n* **Brief Dream/Altered Awareness:**  Having a dream-like state, even if vague, during the event is another piece of information that needs evaluation.\n* **Post-Event Fog:** The \"foggy\" feeling afterward is common after many causes of syncope, but also relevant to consider.\n* **Family History:** Your mother's epilepsy is *highly* relevant, as it increases your (though not necessarily drastically) risk of having seizure disorders.\n* **Your Normal Blood Pressure:**  A typical blood pressure of 110/55 is on the lower side, tending towards hypotension (low blood pressure).\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes (and how they fit your situation):**\n\nLet\u2019s categorize these, starting with the more likely, and moving to things that need to be ruled out.  I'll give a probability judgment (High, Moderate, Low) based *solely* on the information you've provided, recognizing that a doctor needs to assess this fully.\n\n**1. Vasovagal Syncope (High Probability)**\n\n* **What it is:** This is the most common cause of fainting. It happens when your body overreacts to triggers like stress, pain, sight of blood, *or even hyperventilation*.  It causes a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, reducing blood flow to the brain.\n* **How it fits:** The hyperventilation is a classic trigger for vasovagal syncope. Standing up quickly after hyperventilating can exacerbate it.  The brief leg movement and hand scraping *can* occur with vasovagal syncope, though they're usually brief and less organized than a seizure.  The post-event fog is also typical.\n* **Why it's *not* definitively it:** The motor activity (scraping and swinging) is a bit more concerning for a seizure than typically seen in simple vasovagal syncope.\n\n**2. Orthostatic Hypotension (Moderate Probability)**\n\n* **What it is:** A drop in blood pressure when you stand up.  Your normal BP is already on the lower side, so you might be prone to this.\n* **How it fits:** Standing up after hyperventilating can worsen orthostatic hypotension.\n* **Why it's *not* definitively it:**  The leg/hand movements are less typical with pure orthostatic hypotension. Usually, it\u2019s just a feeling of lightheadedness and then fainting.\n\n**3.  Seizure (Moderate Probability - *Requires Urgent Investigation*!)**\n\n* **What it is:** An abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  Seizures can manifest very differently.\n* **How it fits:**  The involuntary movements (leg swinging, hand scraping) are the biggest reason to consider this.  The dream-like state could be part of a seizure aura or post-ictal phase. The family history of epilepsy increases your risk.\n* **Why it's not definitively it:** You don\u2019t mention any other typical seizure symptoms like tongue biting, loss of bowel/bladder control, or a prolonged period of confusion afterward.  Also, the hyperventilation *could* have triggered something else, rather than being part of a seizure.\n* **Important Note:** There are different *types* of seizures.  Some are subtle and don't involve dramatic convulsions.  The movements you experienced could be focal seizures (affecting one part of the brain) with impaired awareness.\n\n**4.  Cardiac Arrhythmia (Low Probability, but Must Be Ruled Out)**\n\n* **What it is:** An irregular heartbeat that can temporarily reduce blood flow to the brain.\n* **How it fits:**  Less likely given your age and stated health, but syncope *always* requires consideration of cardiac causes.\n* **Why it's not likely:** You haven't mentioned any palpitations, chest pain, or history of heart problems.\n\n**5.  Other, Less Likely Possibilities:**\n\n* **Metabolic Issues:**  (e.g., low blood sugar) - Less likely given your healthy profile, but always a consideration.\n* **Neurological Issues (other than epilepsy):**  Rare, but need to be ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n**Why You *Must* See a Doctor (and What They'll Likely Do):**\n\nThis is not something to wait on.  Here's why, and what to expect:\n\n* **To Rule Out Epilepsy:**  Given your mother's history and the motor activity, a doctor needs to determine if this was a seizure.  Misdiagnosing epilepsy can have serious consequences.\n* **To Rule Out Cardiac Causes:**  The doctor will want to be sure your heart is functioning properly.\n* **To Determine the Trigger:** Understanding why you hyperventilated and what led to the syncope is crucial for prevention.\n* **What to expect:**\n    * **Detailed History:** The doctor will ask very specific questions about what happened before, during, and after the event.  Be as detailed as possible.\n    * **Physical Exam:**  Including neurological exam.\n    * **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):**  To check your heart rhythm.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To look for metabolic issues and other potential causes.\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** *Highly likely*. This records electrical activity in the brain and is the primary way to diagnose epilepsy.  It might be done immediately or scheduled soon.\n    * **Possibly Further Imaging:**  Depending on the EEG results, the doctor might order an MRI or CT scan of your brain.\n    * **Tilt Table Test:**  To evaluate for orthostatic hypotension.\n\n**What You Should Do *Now*:**\n\n* **Don't Drive:** Until you've been cleared by a doctor.\n* **Avoid Triggers:**  Try to identify and avoid things that might cause you to hyperventilate (stress, anxiety, etc.).\n* **Be Careful with Posture Changes:**  Rise slowly from sitting or lying down.\n* **Hydrate:**  Drink plenty of fluids.\n* **Tell Someone:**  Ensure a friend or family member knows what happened and can support you.\n\n\n\n**To reiterate: This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.  Please seek immediate medical attention to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.  Don't delay!**\n\nPlease let me know (though I can't offer medical advice) if you have any other details you think might be relevant, but understand that your first step *must* be a visit to a doctor.  I hope you feel better soon."

        "question": "Female, 47, 65kg, 1.62cm, no other medicine or illness until thus far. No smoke, drinking, children or cases in the family.Up until I was 7 I took Gardenal. Then stopped - and my late granduncle was the top pediatric neurologist in the country - and did EEGs yearly until about 25.Had deja-vus up until college, never thought they could be considered related to epilepsy.When I was 45, epidemic, worst job in the world. Colleagues were in Rio, London, Lagos and Dubai. My sleep pattern went haywire, and I turned to Zolpidem to give me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Started at 5mg. As pressure grew, isolation, trouble in the job, slowly I grew the dosage. Had a burnout, left the job, and now I was taking 500mg to 600mg a day. Yes, 2 to 3 boxes. A day. I was floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid.Then I started having tonic-clonics. 8 in few months. I was deeply scared and built a team of therapist, psychologist and neurologist. Good news, nothing physical in the brain. Other good news is that I quit Zolpidem cold turkey, had withdrawal, suffered a lot... But quit.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* important and concerning history. It's excellent that you've assembled a good team of professionals and, crucially, *successfully* stopped the Zolpidem. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, potential explanations, and what to focus on moving forward.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* continue working closely with your medical team.**\n\n**Understanding the Situation: A Complex Picture**\n\nYou've presented a history with several interwoven elements:\n\n* **Early Life History with Gardenal:** Gardenal (barbiturates) was often used for childhood epilepsy. While stopping at 7 is good, early exposure to these drugs *can* sometimes alter brain development and potentially lower the seizure threshold (make seizures more likely). This is often discussed in the context of 'kindling.'\n* **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu:**  While often dismissed, frequent or complex d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu *can* be a simple partial seizure manifestation, especially given your early neurological check-ups.  It's interesting this resolved around college age, but the early association is still noteworthy.\n* **Zolpidem Dependence and Massive Dose:** This is the most immediate and pressing issue.  500-600mg of Zolpidem *daily* is a shockingly high dose.  Zolpidem, even at prescribed doses, can have paradoxical effects and can induce seizures, particularly with rapid dose increases or withdrawal.  Your brain likely became severely adapted to the drug, and its absence triggered the seizures.\n* **Burnout & Stress:** A significant psychological stressor likely contributed to both the escalation of Zolpidem use and potentially to the seizures.  Stress is a known seizure trigger.\n* **Seizures (Tonic-Clonic):** The 8 tonic-clonic seizures are the most alarming symptom. The fact that extensive brain imaging is *negative* is good \u2013 it rules out structural causes like tumors or significant lesions \u2013 but doesn't explain the seizures.\n* **Successful Zolpidem Cessation:**  Quitting cold turkey from that dose of Zolpidem is a massive accomplishment.  Withdrawal is notoriously difficult.\n\n\n\n**Possible Explanations & What Your Doctors Are Likely Considering:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential reasons for your situation, with explanations. Your team is likely evaluating these, but it's helpful for you to understand:\n\n1. **Zolpidem-Induced Seizures (MOST LIKELY):**  This is the most probable explanation given the dosage and timing.  Zolpidem directly affects GABA receptors in the brain, which are crucial for regulating brain activity. Abruptly stopping a high dose disrupts this balance, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. *Even with the cessation, seizure activity can linger for a while as the brain re-stabilizes.*  This is known as *post-withdrawal seizure activity*.\n2. **Underlying Epilepsy (Possible):** The early Gardenal use and the reported d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu raise the possibility of a pre-existing, previously subclinical (not fully expressed) epilepsy. The Zolpidem could have \"unmasked\" it. The fact the seizures stopped *after* stopping Zolpidem doesn\u2019t completely rule this out.\n3. **Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (Rare, but Possible):**  The extreme stress and burnout could, in rare cases, trigger a form of post-traumatic epilepsy. This is less likely if the EEG\u2019s were consistently normal prior to the Zolpidem use.\n4. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) (To be Ruled Out):**  These events *look* like seizures, but are psychological in origin. They're a manifestation of extreme stress and trauma. Your psychological assessment is crucial to rule this in or out. (Often monitored with a video EEG).\n5. **Drug-Induced Sensitivity:** The Zolpidem use may have created a temporary sensitivity, even *after* withdrawal. Meaning your brain is more likely to seize for a period.\n\n\n\n\n**What Needs to Happen Now (Ongoing Management):**\n\nGiven your situation, here's what you should expect and focus on:\n\n* **Continued Neurological Monitoring:**  Even with a normal MRI, your neurologist may recommend:\n    * **Repeated EEGs:** To look for subtle changes or patterns that might not have been present before.  These may be done during sleep deprivation or in more controlled settings.  A 24-48 hour ambulatory EEG is very useful.\n    * **Long-Term EEG monitoring (Video EEG):**  This can capture events as they happen and help differentiate between epileptic seizures and PNES.\n* **Psychological Therapy:**  This is CRITICAL.  Addressing the burnout, trauma, and underlying stressors is essential for your long-term well-being and seizure control.  Therapy can address coping mechanisms, stress management, and potentially PNES if that\u2019s a possibility.  Consider trauma-focused therapy.\n* **Medication (Potentially):**\n    * **Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):** If seizures recur despite psychological interventions, your neurologist *may* consider a trial of AEDs, even though the imaging is normal.  The decision will depend on the frequency, severity, and impact of any further seizures.\n    * **Avoidance of Other Seizure Triggers:**  Sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol, and certain medications can all lower the seizure threshold.\n* **Focus on Sleep Hygiene:**  Even without Zolpidem, establishing a consistent, healthy sleep routine is vital.\n* **Lifestyle Factors:**  Healthy diet, regular exercise (as tolerated), and minimizing stress are important for overall brain health.\n* **Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Keep a detailed log of any unusual sensations, events that precede the seizures, and the seizures themselves. This helps identify potential triggers.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Doctors:**\n\n* \"What is the likelihood that the seizures were solely due to Zolpidem withdrawal, and what is the timeframe for my brain to fully recover?\"\n* \"What is the plan for ongoing EEG monitoring, and how frequently will it be done?\"\n* \"If seizures recur, what are the options for AEDs and what are the potential side effects?\"\n* \"What is the possibility of underlying epilepsy, and what tests are being done to investigate this?\"\n* \"What are the steps to definitively rule out PNES?\"\n* \u201cWhat can I do to improve my overall brain health and reduce my risk of future seizures?\u201d\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou've taken the biggest step by stopping the Zolpidem.  You've also wisely surrounded yourself with professionals.  This is likely a complex recovery process, and it may take time to fully understand what happened and how to prevent future seizures.  Be patient with yourself, continue to follow your medical team's guidance, and prioritize your mental and physical well-being.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I (30F) had a seizure for the first time 3 days ago. I had had a couple beers, smoked a joint, and did some shrooms (none of which is unusual for me). I have no family history of epilepsy, and am in generally good health.I was checked out by paramedics immediately after the seizure who said I looked fine and it was probably from the shrooms. I went to my PCP the next day and she ordered a couple blood tests which all came back normal. I am waiting for brain imaging to be approved by my insurance.Now it\u2019s three days later and I still feel exhausted and weak and slow. I could barely get through my workday today. Is this normal? Is extreme fatigue indicative of something?Also I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant at all but about a month ago I started experiencing extreme nausea to the point I was calling off sick at work, vomiting in the middle of the day, and had just had a doctors appointment to discuss that the week before.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a lot to unpack, and it's good you're being proactive about getting it checked out. It's really smart to connect the nausea with the seizure, even if they seem separate. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, what's normal (and not), what could be happening, and what you should do.  I will preface this with a **very important disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and should not replace a consultation with a qualified medical professional.**\n\n**1. Post-Seizure Fatigue \u2013 Is it Normal?**\n\n*   **Yes, post-ictal fatigue is *very* common.** The period *after* a seizure (called the post-ictal phase) can last hours, days, or even weeks.  The intensity varies greatly person to person.  It's not just tiredness; it's a kind of deep exhaustion, mental slowness, muscle weakness, and difficulty concentrating.  The fact that you're still experiencing it three days later is *not* unusual, but it *does* warrant further investigation.\n*   **Severity and duration:**  The more significant the seizure, the longer the post-ictal phase tends to be. Even if the paramedic assessment was \"you look fine,\" a seizure *still* exacts a toll on the brain.\n*   **Your experience:**  Your description of exhaustion, weakness, and slowness aligns with post-ictal symptoms. The fact that it's impacting your ability to work is significant.\n\n**2. The Role of Substances (Alcohol, Cannabis, Psilocybin)**\n\n*   **Substance-Induced Seizures:** While paramedics reasonably suspected the shrooms, and it's true they can lower the seizure threshold (make a seizure *more* likely), it's *not* a definitive answer.  The combination of alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin complicates things. Any one of these can lower the seizure threshold, and combining them increases that risk.\n*   **First-Time Seizures:** A first-time seizure that's *clearly* linked to a specific, isolated event (like a very high dose of a substance) is often considered less concerning than an unprovoked seizure (one with no identifiable trigger). *However*, that doesn't mean it's automatically \"just the shrooms,\" especially given your developing nausea issues.\n*   **Important Note:** Even if substances were a contributing factor, it doesn't explain *why* you had a lower seizure threshold in the first place. There could be an underlying predisposition.\n\n**3. The Nausea \u2013 A Strong Clue**\n\nThis is the part that worries me the most and is *absolutely* relevant. You're right to connect this. Here's why:\n\n*   **Potential Underlying Cause:** The nausea *predates* the seizure. That makes it far less likely to be simply a result of the substances or the seizure. This suggests a separate, ongoing neurological issue.\n*   **Possible Connections:** Severe nausea and vomiting can be associated with:\n    *   **Migraines:** Some types of migraines can cause seizures (especially in women).  The nausea could be a migraine aura.\n    *   **Increased Intracranial Pressure:**  This is a serious concern.  Anything that increases pressure inside the skull (a tumor, a cyst, bleeding, etc.) can cause nausea, vomiting, and seizures. This is what the brain imaging will hopefully rule out.\n    *   **Other Neurological Conditions:** There are other less common neurological conditions that present with nausea and can lead to seizures.\n* **Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome:** This may be less likely but is worth mentioning. This syndrome causes recurring episodes of severe nausea and vomiting.\n\n**4. What You Should Do *Now* (While Waiting for Imaging)**\n\n*   **Contact Your PCP Again:** Don't wait for them to call you.  Call them and specifically say, \"I'm still experiencing significant fatigue and weakness three days after the seizure, and I'm increasingly concerned about the nausea I've been experiencing for a month. Could we discuss this further, and can you expedite the insurance approval for the brain imaging?\"\n*   **Keep a Detailed Log:**  Document *everything*:\n    *   **Fatigue levels:** Rate your fatigue on a scale of 1-10 throughout the day.\n    *   **Weakness:** Which muscles feel weak?  Is it symmetrical?\n    *   **Cognitive Function:**  Are you having trouble with memory, concentration, or speech?\n    *   **Nausea:** When does the nausea occur? What makes it better or worse?  Are there any triggers?\n    *   **Headaches:** Any changes in headache patterns?\n    *   **Mood Changes:** Any unusual irritability, anxiety, or depression?\n    *   **Sleep:** Are you sleeping well? Are you excessively sleepy during the day?\n*   **Avoid Substances:** Completely abstain from alcohol, cannabis, and *especially* psilocybin until you have a clear diagnosis and your doctor has given you the go-ahead.\n*   **Hydration & Nutrition:**  Focus on staying well-hydrated and eating easily digestible foods.\n*   **Avoid Driving/Operating Machinery:**  Due to the fatigue and potential for another seizure, do not drive or operate heavy machinery.\n* **Emergency Warning Signs:** Go to the Emergency Room *immediately* if you experience any of these:\n    *   Another seizure.\n    *   Severe headache that is different than usual.\n    *   Sudden vision changes.\n    *   Weakness or numbness on one side of your body.\n    *   Difficulty speaking.\n    *   Confusion or altered mental status.\n    *   Fever.\n\n\n\n**Regarding Insurance Approval:**\n\n*   Be prepared to advocate for yourself.  If the insurance company is delaying approval, your doctor's office should assist.  Sometimes, a phone call from the doctor's office can expedite things.\n\n**In summary:** Your situation requires thorough investigation. While the substances may have been a contributing factor, the preceding nausea is a critical piece of the puzzle that needs to be addressed. The brain imaging is paramount. Don't hesitate to be assertive with your medical team and advocate for yourself.\n\n\n\n**Again, I must emphasize that this is not medical advice. This information is intended for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.**"

I will get an overwhelming sensation of doom/panic. My body basically forgets how to breathe. Heart rate goes up. My brain feels weird, dizzy, and fuzzy. I get hot and nauseous. I just don\u2019t feel ok, something in my head just feels very off and I\u2019m scared. These episodes last for a few seconds to a few minutes. I don\u2019t lose consciousness and I can still speak during this happening although it\u2019s hard. Sometimes after I feel tired and sometimes I feel normal. It\u2019s definitely not an anxiety/panic attack as I have those issues and this isn\u2019t the same feeling. I\u2019ve also been experiencing more headaches lately. Tinnitus. Eyesight is just very weird and sensitive all the time with floaters. My short term memory isn\u2019t great anymore. Reading out loud is getting harder. Weird muscle twitches below my lip/chin area. At night when I try to sleep it sometimes it feels like my eyes and brain are about to move side to side\u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a box and someone is shaking it diagonally.

That has happened a handful of times in my life in the past and I went years without it happening and it\u2019s back, and it\u2019s scary and feels horrible. Shaking my head hard helps stop it when I feel it coming on.Does what I\u2019m experiencing sound like focal seizure/epilepsy? I\u2019m really nervous about this. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s all because of the trazodone or if I had this since I was a kid (since I\u2019ve experienced that weird shaking in a box sensation multiple times through my life) and the trazodone made it all come to the surface?Meds I take: klonopin 1mg, vitamin d, probiotic, melatonin 2mg, trazodone 25mg.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot of information, and it's good you're being detailed. You are *right* to be concerned and to want to get this checked out.

This is a complex presentation, and many things could be contributing. Here's a breakdown of why it warrants urgent attention, what could be going on, the role of medication, and what steps to take.\n\n**Why Focal Seizures are a Consideration (and why it needs a doctor):**\n\nMany of your symptoms align with possible focal seizure activity:\n\n* **Sudden onset:**  Episodes coming \"out of nowhere\" are typical of seizures.\n* **Sensory disturbances:**  Light sensitivity (photophobia), changes in vision (floaters, weird sensations), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and the feeling of dizziness are all common *aura* symptoms \u2013 the warning signs before a seizure, or sometimes the seizure *is* the sensory experience.\n* **\"Brain feels weird, fuzzy, dizzy\":**  This strongly suggests altered brain activity.\n* **Automatisms:** The difficulty speaking, even if you're still able to, can be an automism\u2013 a repetitive, involuntary movement or behavior during a seizure.\n* **Post-ictal state:**  Feeling tired *after* an episode is very common post-seizure.\n* **The \"shaking in a box\" sensation:** This is a very specific and concerning description. While not necessarily *exclusive* to seizures, it's a symptom that strongly warrants investigation.  The fact it's happened intermittently throughout your life is also significant.  It sounds like vestibular (inner ear/balance) involvement, which can be related to seizures.\n* **Muscle twitches:**  Especially localized twitches can be seizure-related.\n* **Cognitive difficulties:**  Short-term memory problems and difficulty reading aloud can be associated with temporal lobe seizures specifically.\n* **Headaches:** Can occur before, during, or after seizures.\n\n\n\n**Could it be the Trazodone?**\n\nYes, it *could* be contributing, but it's unlikely to be the sole cause of *all* your symptoms.  Trazodone can, in rare cases, lower the seizure threshold (make seizures more likely in someone predisposed).  It can also cause dizziness, drowsiness, and even some cognitive effects. *However*, the constellation of your symptoms, especially the \u201cshaking in a box\u201d sensation and the feeling of your brain moving, is less typical for a trazodone side effect alone.  The timing (re-emergence of old symptoms coupled with starting trazodone) absolutely needs to be discussed with your doctor.\n\n**Could it be something that's been there since childhood?**\n\nIt's quite possible.  Some types of epilepsy are subtle and can go undiagnosed for years, especially if the seizures are focal and don't involve major convulsions.  The fact that you\u2019ve experienced the \"shaking\" sensation periodically throughout your life suggests that there may be an underlying neurological tendency that has now become more prominent. Again, this is why medical investigation is vital.\n\n\n\n**Other Possibilities (that a Doctor Needs to Rule In/Out):**\n\nWhile focal seizure/epilepsy is a strong consideration, other things could be contributing. These are *not* for self-diagnosis, but just to illustrate the complexity:\n\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Certain types of migraine can cause neurological symptoms that mimic seizures.\n* **Vestibular Problems:** Issues with the inner ear can cause dizziness, imbalance, and that \u201cshaking\u201d sensation.\n* **Neurological Conditions:**  Other neurological conditions (rare, but need to be considered) could cause similar symptoms.\n* **Medication Interactions:**  While you've listed your meds, interactions are always possible.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Need To Do \u2013 *Immediately*:**\n\n1. **Schedule a Doctor's Appointment \u2013 *ASAP*:** This is not something to wait on.  You need to see a doctor, ideally a **neurologist**.  Tell them *everything* you\u2019ve told me, in detail.  Don't downplay anything. Bring a list of your medications and when you started them.\n2. **Consider an EEG:**  An electroencephalogram (EEG) is the primary test for diagnosing epilepsy.  It measures electrical activity in your brain. Your doctor will likely recommend one.\n3. **Keep a Seizure Diary:** Starting *now*, meticulously document:\n    * **Date and Time** of each episode.\n    * **What you were doing** when it started.\n    * **Exact Symptoms:** Be as specific as possible (e.g., \"Light sensitivity \u2013 everything was painfully bright,\" \"Fuzzy feeling in the left side of my head,\" \"Difficulty finding words,\" etc.).\n    * **Duration** of each symptom.\n    * **What happens *after* the episode.** (Tiredness, confusion, etc.)\n    * **Possible Trigger(s):**  Stress, lack of sleep, certain foods, bright lights, computer screen time, etc.\n4. **Discuss your Medications:**  Be honest with your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Discuss whether the trazodone should be adjusted or discontinued *under their guidance*.  **Do not stop taking any medication without talking to your doctor first!**\n5. **Don't Drive (potentially):**  Depending on your doctor\u2019s advice and results of testing, you may need to temporarily stop driving until a diagnosis is reached, as seizures can impair your ability to drive safely.\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **This is not a diagnosis.** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.\n* **Don't panic, but *do* be proactive:**  While this is frightening, many conditions that mimic seizures are treatable.  Early diagnosis and treatment are key.\n* **You are doing the right thing by seeking information and being concerned.**\n\n\n\n**To help your doctor, be prepared to answer questions like these:**\n\n* How would you describe the \u201coff\u201d feeling in your head?\n* Where do you feel the dizziness?  Is it spinning, or more of an imbalance?\n* Does anything make the symptoms better or worse?\n* Is there a family history of seizures or epilepsy?\n* Have you had any recent head injuries?\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

MRI and CT scans normal. Neurolgist reported on EEH as \u2019essentially normal\u2019 with no other details, but has advised GP diagnosis is presumed epilepsy however described it as a difficult case to diagnose. My question is why would he describe the EEG as \u2018essentially normal\u2019 rather than just normal?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex case, and your question is *very* insightful. You're right to question the \"essentially normal\" wording. It's not a throwaway phrase, especially in the context of investigating potential epilepsy. Here's a breakdown of why a neurologist might use that phrasing, considering your medical history, and what it could mean for your ongoing investigation.  I will also add a disclaimer at the end.\n\n**Understanding \"Essentially Normal\" vs. \"Normal\" in an EEG**\n\n* **\"Normal\" EEG:**  A truly normal EEG shows electrical activity within expected ranges for someone of your age, while at rest and during activation procedures (like hyperventilation or photic stimulation).  There would be no clear evidence of epileptic discharges or abnormal patterns.\n* **\"Essentially Normal\":** This is the key. It suggests the EEG *doesn\u2019t show definitive, obvious evidence of epilepsy*, but there's something subtle that's giving the neurologist pause. It\u2019s a flag that things aren\u2019t entirely as expected.  Here's what that \"something\" could be, especially given your situation:\n\n**Possible Reasons for \"Essentially Normal\" in Your Case:**\n\n1. **Subtle Abnormalities:** EEGs aren't perfect. They can miss seizures, especially:\n    * **Subclinical Seizures:**  Seizures happening in the brain without causing obvious outward symptoms.\n    * **Interictal Abnormalities:** Abnormal brain activity *between* seizures. These can be subtle and appear as slowing, spikes, or sharp waves that aren\u2019t frequent or prominent enough to definitively diagnose epilepsy \u2013 but *can* be indicative of underlying issues. The neurologist may have seen something like this.\n    * **Focal/Localized Issues:**  If the seizures are originating from a very small area of the brain, the EEG might not pick it up reliably.  EEGs are better at detecting widespread brain activity.\n    * **Depth of Seizure Focus:** If the area generating the seizures is deep within the brain, the surface EEG may not 'see' it well.\n\n2. **Normal EEG Doesn't Rule Out Epilepsy:** It's critical to remember that *up to 50% of people with epilepsy have a normal EEG*. Especially in cases like yours with complex symptoms, a normal EEG (even an \"essentially normal\" one) doesn\u2019t automatically exclude the diagnosis.  A single normal EEG is rarely definitive.\n\n3. **Impact of Medications:**  Levetiracetam *can* suppress EEG abnormalities, even if it doesn't fully control your symptoms.  The medication might be reducing the frequency or intensity of any epileptic activity, making it harder to detect on the EEG.  \n\n4. **Non-Epileptic Events:** The neurologist is considering (and likely has considered) that your symptoms might not be caused by epilepsy at all.  This is incredibly important given your other conditions.\n\n**How Your Other Diagnoses Factor In**\n\nThis is where things get particularly complex, and why your neurologist described the case as \u2018difficult\u2019.\n\n* **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):**  EDS, particularly hypermobile EDS (which is common) is linked to a *lot* of neurological symptoms that can mimic seizures.  These can include:\n    * **Vasovagal Syncope:** Fainting episodes triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. That \"swooping\" sensation in your head could be related to this.  These episodes can sometimes *look* like a seizure.\n    * **Autonomic Dysfunction:**  EDS often causes problems with the autonomic nervous system (which regulates things like heart rate, blood pressure, breathing). This can lead to fluctuations in blood pressure and unusual sensations.\n    * **Neuropathic Pain & Nerve Compression:** Chronic pain and nerve issues are common in EDS and can cause muscle twitching or other unusual sensations.\n* **Autism:**  Autism can sometimes present with behaviours that are mistaken for seizures, particularly repetitive movements or altered states of awareness.\n* **Asthma & Breathing:** While not directly mimicking seizures, difficulty breathing or medication side effects could potentially contribute to some of the sensations you\u2019re experiencing, or be coincidental with other events.\n\n5. **Nocturnal Events:** The fact that the most prominent events occur at night is significant. Nocturnal seizures can sometimes be harder to capture on routine EEG recordings.  \n\n\n**What Should Happen Next?**\n\nGiven the \"essentially normal\" EEG and your complex history, here's what would be reasonable to discuss with your neurologist and GP:\n\n* **Video-EEG Monitoring:** This is crucial.  You've already started this, which is excellent.  Prolonged monitoring, ideally overnight *while* you\u2019re experiencing episodes, will allow the neurologist to correlate the EEG with your observed symptoms.  This is the gold standard for diagnosis.\n* **Review of Video:** A *detailed* review of the video recordings of your episodes is vital.  What exactly is happening during the movements? Are there any preceding behaviors or triggers?  \n* **Consideration of Non-Epileptic Events:**  A candid discussion about the possibility that your symptoms are *not* epileptic.  This isn't to dismiss your symptoms, but to explore alternative explanations and treatments.  Investigations to rule out vasovagal syncope (tilt table test) and assess autonomic function may be useful.\n* **Repeat EEG:** Depending on the results of video-EEG and further clinical evaluation, a repeat EEG might be considered, possibly with different provocation techniques.\n* **Medication Review:** A careful review of your medications (Levetiracetam and Cetirizine) to look for potential side effects that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n* **Referral**: Consider a referral to a specialist in EDS and associated neurological complications.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your neurologist is the best person to interpret your EEG results in the context of your entire medical history.  Don't hesitate to ask them to elaborate on the \"essentially normal\" finding and what it means for your ongoing care.\n\n\n\nTo help me give you even more tailored information, could you tell me:\n\n*  What type of EDS have you been diagnosed with (specifically)?\n* Did the neurologist give you any specific reasons why they thought the EEG was \u201cessentially normal\u201d?\n* What exactly does the \u201cswooping\u201d sensation feel like?\n* Have any other potential diagnoses been considered?\n\n\n\nI hope this comprehensive answer is helpful.  I know it's frustrating to have a difficult-to-diagnose condition, but you're doing the right thing by asking questions and advocating for yourself."

        "question": "I want to donate plasma, partially because I have O negative blood and would be available every 4 weeks to donate. And partially because I discovered donating plasma also has health benefits for the donors such as reducing micro-plastics in the body.From what I can see online in the UK if you\u2019re epileptic you can\u2019t donate plasma/blood. I was wondering if anyone knew the reason for this? Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a \u2018we\u2019re worried you may have a seizure while donating\u2019 kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it\u2019s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn\u2019t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can\u2019t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nYou've hit on a really frustrating point - the lack of clear, publicly available reasoning for donation restrictions, especially regarding epilepsy. You're right to be curious and question it, and your location (UK) matters since guidelines *do* vary by country. Here's a breakdown of the likely reasons, along with specifics for the UK and considerations for your situation, pulling from official sources and medical understanding.  I'll also address the microplastic aspect, which is interesting.\n\n**Why Epilepsy & Donation Restrictions Exist: The Core Concerns**\n\nThe primary reasons people with epilepsy are deferred from blood/plasma donation aren't usually about the epilepsy *itself* being directly transmissible, but rather a combination of factors related to donor safety and the potential for adverse events during the donation process, *and* concerns about the safety of the recipient plasma/blood product.  These concerns have evolved over time with better understanding of both conditions and donation processes.\n\n1. **Donor Safety - Risk of Seizure:** This is a significant concern.  Donation involves sitting for a period, sometimes feeling a bit lightheaded due to fluid removal, and the slight stress of the procedure.  For someone with epilepsy, even a well-controlled one, there's a *perceived* (and it\u2019s often this \u2013 perceived risk drives policy) increased risk of a seizure being triggered.  This is potentially dangerous for the donor while on the donation chair, and requires immediate medical intervention.  A seizure *during* donation creates a complex situation.\n\n2. **Medication:**  As you suspected, the medications used to control epilepsy are a very big factor.\n    * **Immunomodulating Effects:** Some anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs \u2013 like certain, but not all, older ones) can affect the immune system. This raises concerns about potential immune reactivity in the recipient. While Keppra (levetiracetam) and Eslicarbazepine are *generally* considered to have fewer significant immune effects than some older AEDs, the risk isn\u2019t zero and guidelines are often conservative.\n    * **Drug Levels & Donation Variability:** Medication levels can fluctuate. A donation taking place during a period of lower-than-optimal medication levels could theoretically increase seizure risk.\n    * **Potential for Drug Carryover:** While plasma donation filters remove many components, concerns remain about potential (though likely very low) levels of medication ending up in the donated product.\n\n3. **Recipient Safety - Potential for Subtle Effects:** Even if the AED doesn\u2019t directly harm the recipient, there's a theoretical concern about subtly affecting their immune response or interfering with other medications they might be receiving. This is less of a strong driver than the donor safety concerns, but it's a contributing factor.\n\n**UK Specific Guidelines (as of late 2023/early 2024)**\n\nThe UK blood donation rules are governed by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).  Here's the current position (always check the *latest* on their website \u2013 links at the end):\n\n* **Epilepsy & Donation:** The NHSBT has a clear deferral policy.  You are generally deferred from donating if you have epilepsy.  Critically, the deferral period *varies* based on seizure frequency and control.\n    * **Seizure-free for 12 months:**  If you have been seizure-free *off medication* for at least 12 months *and* your doctor confirms that stopping medication is not a risk to your health, you *may* be considered for donation. This is extremely rare.\n    * **Seizure-free *on medication* for 12 months:** This is where it gets tricky. **Currently, being seizure-free on medication for 12 months does *not* automatically qualify you.** The NHSBT generally requires specialist neurological review to assess it on a case by case basis.\n    * **Any seizure in the last 4 weeks:** Automatic deferral.\n\n* **Doctor's Letter:** A doctor's letter *can* potentially help, but it's not a guaranteed override.  The letter needs to specifically address:\n    * Confirmation of your diagnosis and seizure history.\n    * Length of time seizure-free.\n    * Details of your medication (names, dosages).\n    * A clear statement of the doctor's opinion that donating plasma/blood would *not* pose an unacceptable risk to *your* health.\n    *  Specifically, the letter would need to address the risks of the donation process itself (sitting for a period, fluid removal).\n\n**Your Specific Situation (27 year old female, Keppra & Eslicarbazepine, BMI 20, healthy lifestyle)**\n\nYou have a *relatively* good profile, in terms of overall health.  Your BMI is healthy, and you don't smoke or drink which are both positives.  The fact you're on Keppra and Eslicarbazepine is a small benefit, as they are newer AEDs generally associated with fewer side effects.\n\nHowever, the 12-month seizure-free requirement whilst *on* medication is the major hurdle.  If you have been seizure-free for this long, a detailed letter from your neurologist is essential. They would need to specifically address the points above, and be prepared to justify why *your* individual case represents a low risk.  Be prepared for the NHSBT to still potentially decline you, even with a supportive letter.  They are cautious.\n\n**Regarding Microplastics**\n\nYou are correct to bring this up! Emerging research suggests plasma donation *can* reduce the burden of microplastics and nanoplastics in the body.  The plasmapheresis process (plasma donation) removes plasma, which is where these particles are often found circulating. This is a very new area of research, and the long-term benefits are still unknown, but your awareness of this is spot-on.  It\u2019s a compelling reason to advocate for more flexible guidelines, especially for individuals who are otherwise healthy.\n\n**Resources & Next Steps**\n\n* **NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) \u2013 Eligibility Checker:** [https://www.blood.co.uk/can-i-give-blood/#eligibility](https://www.blood.co.uk/can-i-give-blood/#eligibility) \u2013 Use this to get an initial indication (but it's not definitive).\n* **NHSBT \u2013 Specific Guidance on Epilepsy:** [https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/news/blood-donation-and-epilepsy/](https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/news/blood-donation-and-epilepsy/)\n* **NHSBT \u2013 Contact Information:** [https://www.blood.co.uk/contact-us/](https://www.blood.co.uk/contact-us/) \u2013  You can contact them directly with specific questions about your case.\n* **Talk to Your Neurologist:**  This is the most important step. Discuss your desire to donate and get their honest assessment of the risks and their willingness to write a supportive letter.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general understanding only and should not be substituted for professional medical consultation.  Always consult with your doctor about your individual health situation and before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nGood luck!  It's worth exploring the possibility, but be prepared for potential obstacles.  The rules are conservative, but advocates are pushing for more nuanced guidelines based on individual risk assessment."

She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really concerning situation and you're a good friend for seeking information and trying to help. It's good she's been hospitalized, but the lack of a clear diagnosis is understandably frightening. Here's a breakdown of advice, organized into categories, addressing the possible issues and what you can do to support your friend.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response; this is not medical advice.**\n\n**1. Understanding the Situation - What's Possible (and Why It's Complex)**\n\n* **Not necessarily \"seizures\":** You're right to question the label. The symptoms your friend describes (confusion, amnesia, dizziness leading to an event followed by post-event pain) *can* be seizure-like, but they can also be caused by other things, especially in pregnancy.  The doctors dismissing them as \"not proper seizures\" is a flag that warrants deeper investigation.\n* **Low Magnesium & Oxygen:** These *are* significant findings, but they might be a result *of* something else, not the root cause. Low magnesium can definitely cause neurological symptoms, and low oxygen saturation (93% is below normal) can cause dizziness and confusion, and even trigger seizure-like activity.\n* **Prior Sepsis:**  This is *crucially* important. Sepsis can have long-term neurological effects, even after it's treated. It can sometimes trigger autoimmune responses that affect the brain, or lead to subtle damage. It dramatically changes the risk profile. The previous pregnancy loss due to sepsis adds a layer of complexity and potential for recurrent issues.\n* **Pregnancy-Specific Causes:** Pregnancy significantly alters physiology.  There are pregnancy-specific conditions that can mimic seizures:\n    * **Eclampsia:** This is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and seizures, usually in the third trimester, but can occur earlier.  While her blood pressure hasn't been mentioned, it needs constant monitoring.\n    * **HELLP syndrome:** A severe form of pre-eclampsia affecting the liver and blood, with neurological symptoms possible.\n    * **POSTPARTUM seizures:** although she is not postpartum, the body doesn\u2019t revert back to \u201cnormal\u201d instantly. \n    * **Migraines:**  Migraines can sometimes present with atypical symptoms, including transient neurological deficits that could be mistaken for seizures.\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Events (PNES):**  These are events that *look* like seizures but aren't caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are often triggered by stress, trauma, or psychological factors. Your friend's history of trauma (sepsis, pregnancy loss) makes this a possibility that should be considered, *but only after ruling out other causes*.\n\n\n\n**2. What Needs to Happen Medically - Advocacy for Your Friend**\n\nYour friend needs a *much* more thorough investigation. Here's what should be happening (you can politely ask the doctors if these things are being done, or help her ask):\n\n* **Repeat & Expanded Blood Work:** Beyond magnesium, they need to check:\n    * **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To look for infection or anemia.\n    * **Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium):** Imbalances can contribute.\n    * **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To assess for HELLP syndrome.\n    * **Kidney Function Tests:**\n    * **Thyroid Function Tests:** Thyroid issues can sometimes cause neurological symptoms.\n    * **Coagulation Studies:** To assess blood clotting.\n    * **Inflammatory Markers (CRP, ESR):** Can indicate inflammation related to the prior sepsis.\n    * **Vitamin D levels:** Deficiency can sometimes cause neurological symptoms.\n* **Neurological Evaluation:**  A neurologist *needs* to be involved.\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** While an EEG *can* be normal during some types of seizures, it's the primary test to look for abnormal brain activity. They may need to do a prolonged EEG (24-48 hours) to catch an event. An EEG is crucial.\n    * **MRI of the Brain:** To look for any structural abnormalities, signs of stroke, or other issues.\n    * **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** To rule out infection or inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially given the sepsis history). *This is important, but should be discussed with the doctor as it has risks during pregnancy.*\n* **Continuous Fetal Monitoring:**  To ensure the baby is not being affected by her events.\n* **Cardiovascular Evaluation:**  Given the low oxygen saturation, a check of her heart function might be warranted (echocardiogram).\n* **Detailed History (Again!):** The doctors need a *very* detailed timeline of events:\n    * Precise description of what happens *before*, *during*, and *after* the episodes.\n    * What triggers them (if anything).\n    * How long they last.\n    * Any associated symptoms (headache, vision changes, nausea, weakness, etc.).\n    * A comprehensive medical history, including the details of the sepsis and the previous pregnancy loss.\n* **Second Opinion:** If your friend is not getting satisfactory answers, encourage her to seek a second opinion from another neurologist, ideally one specializing in pregnancy-related neurological conditions.\n\n\n\n**3. How You Can Support Your Friend**\n\n* **Be Present:**  Go with her to appointments if she wants you to.  Just having someone there can make a huge difference.\n* **Help with Communication:** If she's confused or struggling to remember things, help her write down questions for the doctors and take notes during appointments.\n* **Advocate (with her permission):**  Politely advocate for her to receive the thorough evaluation she needs.\n* **Emotional Support:** This is incredibly stressful.  Listen to her fears and concerns without judgment.  Reassure her that you're there for her.\n* **Help with Practicalities:**  Offer to help with tasks like cooking, cleaning, or childcare if she has other children.\n* **Encourage Her to be Vocal:**  She needs to clearly communicate her symptoms and concerns to the medical team.\n* **Help Her Track Symptoms:** Keep a detailed log of when the events happen, what she was doing beforehand, and what symptoms she experiences. This data can be incredibly helpful for the doctors.\n\n**4. Important Reminders**\n\n* **Don't try to diagnose her yourself.** You're a friend, not a doctor.\n* **Avoid giving medical advice.**  Focus on supporting her in getting the care she needs.\n* **Encourage her to trust her instincts.** If she feels like something is being missed, she should speak up.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. Your friend\u2019s situation is complex and potentially serious, and requires the expertise of medical professionals. This is especially critical given her pregnancy.  \n\n\n\n**Resources that might be helpful:**\n\n* **American Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **Preeclampsia Foundation:** [https://www.preeclampsia.org/](https://www.preeclampsia.org/)\n* **Sepsis Alliance:** [https://www.sepsis.org/](https://www.sepsis.org/)\n\n\n\nI truly hope your friend gets a clear diagnosis and the care she needs. It's great that you're being such a supportive friend. Please urge her to be persistent with the doctors until they get to the bottom of this."

I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",

This is for informational purposes only, and a thorough discussion with your neurologist is absolutely vital.**\n\n**First, let's recap what we know:**\n\n* **Significant Overdose:** You experienced a severe overdose of dextromethorphan (DXM) at 15, leading to coma, intubation, and a significant psychotic episode.  DXM toxicity *can* cause neurological effects, even lasting ones.\n* **Seizures:** You began having grand mal seizures about 6 months after the overdose.\n* **Initial MRI Finding:** An MRI revealed a brain lesion with abnormal electrical activity (\"secretions firing off\") identified as the likely cause of your seizures.\n* **Recent MRI:**  A more recent MRI shows only a \"tiny possible lesion.\" This is the core of your question.\n* **Medications:** Lamictal (lamotrigine) for seizure control and mood stabilization, and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) for ADHD (presumably, although you didn\u2019t state a diagnosis).\n* **Seizure Frequency:** You've noticed feeling like you're having *more* seizures, and more consistently linked to missed doses of Lamictal.\n\n\n\n**Now, let\u2019s address your questions, piece by piece:**\n\n**1. Could the lesion be shrinking?**\n\nYes, it absolutely *is* possible for a brain lesion to appear smaller, or even resolve, on subsequent MRIs. Here's why:\n\n*   **Inflammation/Edema:** The initial lesion could have been surrounded by inflammation and swelling (edema).  This makes it appear larger on an MRI. Over time, this inflammation can subside, reducing the apparent size of the lesion. \n*   **Resolution of Damage:** In some cases, if the damage was initially due to a reversible process (e.g., temporary disruption of blood flow, inflammatory response), the tissue can heal to some degree. \n*   **MRI Sensitivity & Technique:**  MRIs can be sensitive, and slight differences in imaging technique (machine settings, contrast used, etc.) can sometimes affect how a lesion appears. *However*, a substantial difference like going from a clearly defined lesion to a \"tiny possible lesion\" is significant.\n*   **Remodeling:**  The brain has some capacity to reorganize and reroute around areas of damage.  While it doesn't *fix* the underlying issue, it can sometimes minimize the visible impact on an MRI.\n* **The effects of medication:** Sometimes medication can reduce the inflammation and swelling around the lesion which in turn can make it appear smaller.\n\n**2. If the lesion *is* shrinking, would my seizures stop?**\n\nThis is the big question, and the answer is: **potentially, yes, but not necessarily immediately, and there's a lot of nuance.**\n\n*   **Reduced Irritation:** If the lesion is truly shrinking and the abnormal electrical activity is decreasing, it would naturally make seizures less likely.\n*   **Medication Still Needed (Initially):**  Even if the lesion is shrinking, *do not stop or change your medication without your neurologist\u2019s explicit instruction.* Your brain has adapted to the medication.   Suddenly stopping could trigger seizures, even with a smaller lesion.  Your neurologist will likely want to gradually taper your dose *if* they feel it's safe, guided by your EEG results and seizure control.\n*   **Scar Tissue:**  Even if the initial lesion has significantly diminished, it might leave behind some scar tissue.  Scar tissue can sometimes still be epileptogenic (meaning it can trigger seizures), even if less frequently.\n*   **Seizure Threshold:** The overdose at 15 could have lowered your seizure threshold, meaning your brain is now more susceptible to seizures even with a minimal lesion.\n*  **Your increased seizure frequency relating to missed doses:** This tells your neurologist that your brain is very sensitive to levels of Lamictal in your system, indicating that the medication is actively working to prevent seizures.\n\n\n\n**Regarding your observation about increased seizure frequency with missed doses:**\n\nThis is **very important information** for your neurologist. It suggests:\n\n*   **Your brain is currently reliant on the medication:**  The Lamictal is actively suppressing your seizure activity, and even a single missed dose can be enough to disrupt that balance.\n*   **The underlying issue is still present:** Even if the lesion is shrinking, your brain\u2019s vulnerability to seizures hasn\u2019t completely resolved.\n* **Potential for changes in medication metabolism**: It's possible that your body is metabolizing (processing) the Lamictal differently now than it did as a teenager. This could be due to various factors (weight changes, other medications, etc.).\n\n**What you should do now:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Detailed Appointment with Your Neurologist:**  This is the *most important* step.  Explain all of your concerns, especially the feeling that you\u2019re having more seizures and how closely they are tied to missed doses.  Bring a list of specific questions.\n2.  **Ask for a Clear Explanation of the MRI Results:**  Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your neurologist to explain the MRI findings in a way you understand.  Ask them specifically about:\n    *   What caused the initial lesion?\n    *   What does the \"tiny possible lesion\" mean? Is it still actively causing abnormal electrical activity?\n    *   What is the likely reason for the change in the lesion\u2019s appearance?\n    *   What does this mean for your long-term seizure control?\n3.  **Discuss Medication Management:**  Ask about the possibility of gradually reducing your medication, *if* the lesion continues to shrink and your seizures remain well-controlled. *Never* attempt to change your medication on your own.\n4.  **EEG Monitoring:** Continue with regular EEG monitoring as recommended by your neurologist. EEGs can help detect abnormal brain activity even *between* seizures.\n5.  **Keep a Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Record the date, time, and any potential triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, missed medication) for each seizure. This information will be valuable to your neurologist.\n6. **Discuss your Marijuana Use:** Be honest with your neurologist about your marijuana use. It can interact with your medications and potentially affect seizure control.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **The DXM overdose:** The long-term neurological effects of a severe DXM overdose are not fully understood. It\u2019s possible that contributed to the initial lesion and/or your ongoing seizure vulnerability.\n* **Psychosis:** Your history of psychosis after the overdose is relevant and may influence medication choices.\n\n**You are advocating for yourself by asking these questions.** It\u2019s essential that you and your neurologist work together to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and concerns.  Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel you're not getting the answers you need.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "40 years old, 10 stone (140 pounds)Epilepsy-Asthma-Thyroid-Scoliosis-Bladder conditionMeds: Epilim chrono 500mg, Epilim 200mg, Etanercept, Ventolin, LevothyroxineI take one 200mg Epilim pill in the morning and two 500mg ones in the evening. In the morning I take the 200mg pill with my breakfast fine, but when I take the 500mg tablet after dinner, I swallow the tablet with water like in the morning, I'm coughing up the water and the pill is getting lodged in my throat. This has been happening every other day in the last 2 weeks.I'm coughing up phelgmn and I've tried warm water to force the pill down as it is a enteric-coated pill, which reacts with water straight away. The longer the pill stays in my throat, it scrapes my throat and blood comes out with my spit. My throat is sore afterwards which takes two days to recover. I have to take my Epilepsy pills for life.I'm afraid to keep taking the 500ml tablets in the evening, as I keep having this reaction.Should I take 5 of the 200mg pills instead to make up the 1000mg required in the evening which are easier to swallow or do something else?I'm going to speak to my pharmacist and GP tomorrow morning as well about it.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and concerning. You're right to be worried, and you're absolutely doing the right thing by planning to speak to your pharmacist and GP tomorrow. Here's a breakdown of why this is happening, what you *shouldn't* do, and what you should discuss with your healthcare professionals, along with points to consider given your medical history.  I will also add a **disclaimer** at the end.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nSeveral factors likely contribute to this:\n\n* **Dysphagia (Difficulty Swallowing):** You're experiencing dysphagia.  The feeling of the pill getting stuck, coughing, and throat irritation are all classic symptoms.  This can be made worse by several things.\n* **Medication Formulation:**  Enteric-coated pills are designed *not* to dissolve in the stomach. They're coated to protect the medication, but this coating can sometimes make them more difficult to swallow smoothly.  You are correct that immediately reacting with water may affect the coating, but it seems that the issue isn't *just* the coating \u2013 it's the physical passage of the pill itself.\n* **Underlying Conditions:** Your history is significant.\n    * **Asthma:**  Asthma can sometimes cause increased mucus production and throat sensitivity, contributing to coughing and potentially making swallowing difficult.\n    * **Scoliosis:** Depending on the severity and curvature, scoliosis can rarely affect the esophagus (the tube that carries food and medication to your stomach), potentially causing narrowing or difficulty with swallowing.\n    * **Thyroid:** Thyroid issues can sometimes contribute to muscle weakness, which *could* affect swallowing muscles (although this is less common).\n    * **Bladder condition:** While seemingly unrelated, frequent medications and general health concerns can sometimes contribute to overall fatigue and potentially impact muscle function.\n* **Epilepsy Medication Side Effects:**  While less common, some anti-epileptic drugs can sometimes cause esophageal or throat discomfort, although usually not this severe.\n* **Timing:** The fact it happens primarily with the evening dose suggests it might be related to a change in posture (lying down sooner after taking it), increased mucus production overnight, or simply fatigue later in the day.\n\n\n\n**What You Absolutely Should *Not* Do (Without Medical Advice)**\n\n* **Do NOT change your dosage or medication regimen on your own.** This is critical, especially with epilepsy medication.  Altering your medication without your doctor's supervision can lead to seizures.  Your suggestion of switching to 5 x 200mg is something to *discuss* with your doctor, not implement independently.\n* **Do NOT force the issue with excessive amounts of water.** You\u2019ve already tried this, and it's clearly not helping.  It\u2019s making the coughing worse and causing throat irritation.\n* **Do NOT continue repeatedly traumatizing your throat.**  The bleeding is a sign that you're causing actual damage.\n\n\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Pharmacist and GP (Prioritized)**\n\n1. **Report the Symptoms in Detail:** Describe *exactly* what you've outlined here.  The coughing, the feeling of the pill lodging, the amount of phlegm, the soreness, and the bleeding are all important details.\n2. **Discuss Alternative Formulations:**  This is the most important conversation.\n    * **Liquid Formulation:**  Ask if Epilim (valproic acid) is available in a liquid form. This would bypass the swallowing issue entirely. This is likely the best first approach.\n    * **Different Tablet Size/Shape:** Are smaller-sized 500mg tablets available? Sometimes a slightly different shape or coating can make a difference.\n    * **Scoring:**  Can the 500mg tablets be safely split? *Do not attempt to split them yourself without specific guidance from your pharmacist.*  Some enteric-coated tablets *cannot* be split because it compromises the coating.\n3. **Dosage Adjustment (with Doctor ONLY):**  \"I'm wondering if it\u2019s possible to switch to 5 x 200mg tablets in the evening instead of the two 500mg, as I find them easier to swallow.  Is that a safe and effective option?\"  Your doctor needs to assess if this maintains adequate seizure control.\n4. **Swallowing Evaluation:** Ask your GP about a referral to a speech-language pathologist (SLP).  They specialize in swallowing disorders and can:\n    * Assess your swallowing mechanics.\n    * Teach you techniques to improve swallowing.\n    * Recommend specific food/liquid consistencies to aid swallowing.\n5. **Investigate Underlying Causes:**  Given your medical history:\n    * **Scoliosis Check:**  Ask if your scoliosis needs re-evaluation to rule out any esophageal involvement.\n    * **Asthma Control:**  Ensure your asthma is optimally controlled, as excess mucus can worsen swallowing.\n    * **Thyroid Levels:** Confirm your thyroid levels are stable.\n6. **Throat Examination:** Have your GP examine your throat to assess the extent of the irritation and rule out any other potential causes.  They may suggest a throat lozenge or medication to soothe the irritation.\n7. **Potential Drug Interactions:** While unlikely, it's worth asking if there's any interaction between your medications that could be contributing to increased mucus production or throat sensitivity.\n\n\n\n**Additional Tips (to discuss with your doctor/pharmacist)**\n\n* **Posture:** Try taking the evening dose while sitting fully upright, and remain upright for at least 30 minutes afterward. Avoid lying down immediately.\n* **With Meals:** You're already taking the morning dose with food, which is good.  Ensure your evening meal is not too dry; a slightly moist consistency might help.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  Your situation requires a thorough evaluation and personalized recommendations from your doctor and pharmacist.  Do not delay seeking professional medical attention.\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope you get this sorted out quickly. It sounds very uncomfortable, and it's vital to find a solution that allows you to take your medication safely and effectively.  Let me know if you have any other questions *after* you've spoken with your healthcare team \u2013 I can help you formulate further questions, if needed."

        "question": "23F, 5'8, 134 lbs, medications: trokendi xr switching over to topiramate, nonsmoker, epileptic, no location, and no photo.Hello, my medication trokendi xr is currently on backorder, and my neurologist sent a new prescription in for some generic topiramate. The only question I did not get to ask him was if I have to continue only taking 1 a day since trokendi is an extended release or if I have to take 2 a day. Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very important question, and you're right to ask! Switching from an extended-release medication like Trokendi XR to immediate-release topiramate requires careful consideration of the dosage schedule.  It is **absolutely crucial** to get this right to maintain seizure control and minimize potential side effects.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why this is important and what you need to do, followed by a strong disclaimer:**\n\n**Why the difference matters:**\n\n* **Trokendi XR (extended-release):** This medication releases the topiramate slowly over 24 hours, providing a consistent level in your bloodstream with one daily dose.\n* **Generic Topiramate (immediate-release):** This medication releases all of the topiramate at once.  Because of this, it's typically taken *twice* a day (every 12 hours) to mimic the steady-state concentration achieved with the extended-release version.\n\n**Likely, you will need to take the generic topiramate twice daily.** A common conversion is that 25mg of Trokendi XR is roughly equivalent to 50mg of immediate-release Topiramate per day, *split into two doses.* However **do not assume this is the correct conversion for you.**  Dosage conversions are highly individualized and depend on your specific diagnosis, seizure type, metabolism, and other factors.\n\n**What you *must* do (and quickly):**\n\n1. **Contact your neurologist's office *immediately*.** This is not something you should guess at.  Call them as soon as possible and explain the situation. Ask specifically:\n    * \"I'm switching from Trokendi XR to generic topiramate due to the backorder. What is the correct dosage schedule for me?  Specifically, should I take one or two pills per day, and what is the dosage of each pill?\" \n    * Mention your current Trokendi XR dosage (e.g., 25mg, 50mg, etc.). This is essential.\n    * Ask if there's anything else you should be aware of when switching.\n2. **Do *not* change your dosage until you have talked to your neurologist or their staff.**  Abruptly changing your dosage or taking the wrong amount could lead to breakthrough seizures or increased side effects.\n3. **If you can't reach your neurologist immediately:** Contact the pharmacy that filled the prescription. The pharmacist *may* be able to clarify, but **always confirm with your neurologist as soon as you possibly can.** Pharmacists can offer guidance, but the prescribing physician\u2019s instructions take precedence.\n\n\n\n**Important Information about Topiramate (regardless of formulation):**\n\n* **Side Effects:** Be aware of potential side effects like tingling in your hands and feet, cognitive difficulties (trouble concentrating, memory problems), weight loss, nausea, and fatigue.  These are common, and often diminish over time, but report anything concerning to your doctor.\n* **Hydration:**  Topiramate can sometimes contribute to kidney stones. Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n* **Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors:** If you're taking other medications that affect kidney function or blood acidity, let your doctor know.  Topiramate also has an effect on these.\n* **Birth Control:** Topiramate can make some birth control methods less effective. If you are of childbearing potential, discuss this with your doctor.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Before I start of with everything I am diagnosed with BPD, epilepsy, anxiety, aura headaches, pcos, and vertigo. It started with me just getting vertigo in 2019 and it went away with medication but came back within a week and i got chest pains and went to see a cardiologist and everything was okay. I was then sent to a neurologist and they finally diagnosed me with epilepsy but I don't have seizures. for awhile though i was having episodes of \"falling into the ground\" feelings and if i was in the car it would feel like i was falling back. I would just get odd feelings like that. i was told i basically have micro seizures. there's times where i get dizzy and don't feel good or just don't feel right and im guessing it could just be depersonalization but I'm honestly not sure. l've been now struggling with a migraine for over a month now and i had a mri done that came out normal and im having another one and a mra done tomorrow to see if something looks off. I've been struggling with migraines for awhile but never like this. I'm honestly just hoping maybe someone has had a similar experience or a answer? idk I've been in so much painMedications: metaformin Aimoveg, only one shot so far venlafaxine bupropion Mag oxide ToprimateHeight; 5'7 Weight: 180 I only smoke sometimes , I never drink alcohol",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that sounds incredibly complex and frustrating. You're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable why you're seeking answers and feeling overwhelmed. It's good you're being proactive with your medical care and getting further testing done. Let's break down what you've shared, explore potential connections, and discuss things that might be happening. **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response, as I am NOT a medical professional.**\n\n**Let's recap the key pieces, then I'll offer thoughts and potential areas to discuss with your doctors:**\n\n* **Multiple Diagnoses:** BPD, Epilepsy (without classic seizures), Anxiety, Aura Headaches, PCOS, Vertigo. This is a lot to manage, and these conditions *can* interact and exacerbate each other.\n* **Evolving Symptoms:** Started with vertigo, then chest pain (ruled out cardiac), then \"falling\" sensations (suspected micro-seizures), ongoing dizziness, and now a very persistent migraine.\n* **\"Falling\" Sensations/Possible Depersonalization:** These are subjective and difficult to diagnose. The description of \"falling into the ground\" or in the car is interesting and points towards possible neurological involvement.\n* **Persistent Migraine:** A migraine lasting over a month is called *status migrainosus*, which needs thorough investigation. A normal MRI is good, but the MRA (MR Angiogram) is important to look at blood vessels.\n* **Medications:** A complex regimen potentially addressing multiple issues.\n* **Lifestyle:** Occasional smoking, no alcohol.\n\n**Potential Connections and Thoughts (Things to Discuss with Your Doctors):**\n\n1. **Epilepsy & \"Micro-Seizures\" and the \"Falling\" Sensations:**  You've been told about \"micro-seizures,\" which suggests subtle electrical disturbances in the brain that don't result in typical convulsions. These can manifest in a huge variety of ways \u2013 including the sensation of falling, dizziness, disorientation, and even altered emotional states.  It\u2019s crucial to clarify with your neurologist *exactly* what kind of epilepsy you have, what these episodes are thought to be, and how they're impacting your symptoms.  Are they happening more frequently now with the migraine? Does the migraine seem to *trigger* them?\n\n2. **Migraine & Epilepsy Connection:** There\u2019s a well-established connection between migraine and epilepsy. People with epilepsy are more likely to experience migraines, and vice versa.  Sometimes, migraines *can* even appear seizure-like (migraine with aura, for example).  Your ongoing migraine could be interacting with your epilepsy in a complex way.  Status migrainosus (month-long migraine) isn't typical and warrants thorough investigation.\n\n3. **Vestibular Issues & Migraine:** Vertigo is a symptom of inner ear problems (vestibular system), but migraine can also *cause* vertigo and dizziness, even without a headache. Given your history of vertigo, it's possible the migraine is triggering vestibular symptoms again.  A vestibular therapist could be helpful.\n\n4. **PCOS & Migraine/Neurological Symptoms:** There is emerging research linking PCOS to an increased risk of migraine and other neurological issues. Hormonal fluctuations associated with PCOS are thought to play a role.\n\n5. **BPD and Somatization/Depersonalization:** Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can involve intense emotional experiences and difficulties with self-perception.  It CAN contribute to heightened sensitivity to bodily sensations and, in some cases, experiences that resemble depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself).  However, it's *very* important not to attribute *everything* to BPD. It's vital to rule out physical causes first.  The feelings you describe could be neurological, psychological, or a combination. Therapy focused on emotional regulation and distress tolerance (common in BPD treatment) may help manage these feelings, but it doesn\u2019t negate the need to explore the physical causes.\n\n6. **Medication Interactions:** You're on a lot of medication. While each one is likely prescribed for a specific reason, it's worth reviewing with your prescribing doctors (or a pharmacist) to ensure there are no interactions contributing to your symptoms.  For example, some medications can worsen migraines.\n\n7. **Aura Headaches:** These relate to migraines, with visual or other sensory disturbances before the headache itself. It is important to keep track of these.\n\n\n\n**What The MRA Can Show:**\n\nThe MRA is crucial because it examines the blood vessels in your brain. This will help rule out:\n\n* **Aneurysms:** Bulges in blood vessels.\n* **Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs):** Abnormal connections between arteries and veins.\n* **Vasospasm:** Narrowing of blood vessels\n* **Other Vascular Issues:** That could be contributing to headaches or neurological symptoms.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n* **Detailed Symptom Journal:**  This is *critical*. Track:\n    * **Headache details:** Location, intensity (scale of 1-10), type of pain (throbbing, stabbing, pressure), associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, visual disturbances).\n    * **\"Falling\" sensations:** When they occur, what triggers them, how long they last, what specifically do they feel like.\n    * **Dizziness:** Type of dizziness (spinning, lightheadedness, imbalance), duration, triggers.\n    * **Emotional state:** Note your mood and anxiety levels.\n    * **Medication timing:** When you take your medications and if you notice any correlation with symptom changes.\n    * **Sleep:**  How much sleep are you getting? Sleep disturbances can worsen migraines, epilepsy, and mood disorders.\n    * **Stress levels:** Track significant stressors.\n* **Communicate with Your Doctors:** Be thorough and honest.  Don't downplay your symptoms.  Bring your symptom journal to appointments.\n* **Consider a Second Opinion (Neurologist):** If you're not confident in your current neurologist's assessment, seeking a second opinion can be valuable.\n* **Explore a Vestibular Therapist:** If dizziness and balance issues are prominent, a vestibular therapist can provide exercises to improve your balance and reduce dizziness.\n* **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Given your anxiety and BPD, practices like mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and meditation might help manage stress and reduce the intensity of symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "So i had an epilepsy seizure when i was like 4-5 months old. I took medication daily for 7 years, and i had no more seizures. Im 17 years old now. Can my epilepsy come back? If it can what can cause it?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good question and a common concern for people who had childhood epilepsy that went into remission. Here's a breakdown of the possibilities, what can cause a return (recurrence), and what you should do.  I'll give a thorough answer, but **please read the disclaimer at the end as I am not a medical professional.**\n\n**Can Epilepsy Come Back After Being in Remission?**\n\nYes, it absolutely *can* come back. However, it's not a certainty. The chances of recurrence depend on a lot of factors, and it's highly individual. Here's a general idea of the probabilities, but these are just averages and your personal case might be different:\n\n*   **Childhood Onset Epilepsy & Remission:** When epilepsy resolves in childhood (particularly after a prolonged seizure-free period like yours), the likelihood of recurrence is generally *lower* than for epilepsy that starts in adulthood.\n*   **Length of Remission:**  The longer you've been seizure-free, the *lower* the risk.  You've been seizure-free for over 12 years, which is a very positive sign.  The risk decreases significantly with each passing year.\n*   **Type of Epilepsy:** The specific type of epilepsy you had as a baby matters. Some epilepsy syndromes are more likely to recur than others.  (Unfortunately, you likely don't have specific details on this from that long ago.)\n*   **Underlying Cause:** If the epilepsy had a clear cause (like a fever-induced seizure, a minor brain malformation, or a genetic factor), that can influence the risk of return. If it was \"idiopathic\" (no clear cause found), the pattern of recurrence can be harder to predict.\n\n**Generally speaking, estimates suggest that about 10-30% of children who achieve remission from epilepsy will experience a recurrence at some point.**  However, many of these recurrences happen within the first few years after stopping medication.  Your length of remission significantly lowers your risk compared to someone stopping medication more recently.\n\n\n\n**What Can Cause a Return of Epilepsy (Recurrence)?**\n\nMany things *can* potentially trigger a seizure or a return of epileptic activity. Here's a breakdown of potential triggers, categorized:\n\n**1. Lifestyle Factors (Often Significant, Especially in Adolescence/Young Adulthood):**\n\n*   **Sleep Deprivation:**  This is a *huge* one, especially for teenagers.  Changing sleep schedules, pulling all-nighters, insufficient sleep \u2013 all increase seizure risk.  Your brain needs consistent, restorative sleep.\n*   **Stress:**  High levels of stress can lower the seizure threshold.  This includes academic stress, social stress, emotional stress, and major life changes.\n*   **Alcohol & Drug Use:** Alcohol (even moderate amounts) and recreational drugs (including marijuana, and especially stimulants) can disrupt brain activity and trigger seizures. This is particularly important during adolescence when the brain is still developing.\n*   **Skipping Medication (If you were ever briefly back on it):**  If you went back on medication for any reason and then stopped it inconsistently, this could trigger a seizure. (Since you\u2019ve been off for years, this is less likely, but worth mentioning).\n*   **Dehydration:**  Significant dehydration can sometimes contribute.\n*   **Poor Diet:**  While not a direct trigger for most, a very poor diet lacking essential nutrients could play a role in overall brain health.\n\n**2. Medical Factors:**\n\n*   **Illness with Fever:**  High fevers (especially in childhood, but potentially at any age) can sometimes trigger seizures, even in people with well-controlled epilepsy.\n*   **Head Injury:**  Any concussion or significant head trauma is a risk factor.\n*   **Infections:**  Brain infections (meningitis, encephalitis) are a serious concern. Even systemic infections with high fever can be a factor.\n*   **Metabolic Imbalances:**  Problems with blood sugar, sodium, calcium, or other electrolytes can sometimes trigger seizures.\n*   **Hormonal Changes:**  For females, hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or menopause *can* sometimes affect seizure control.\n*   **New Medical Conditions:**  Developing a new neurological condition can sometimes increase the risk.\n*   **Medications:** Certain medications can lower the seizure threshold (though this is less common). (Always tell doctors you have a history of epilepsy before starting new medications.)\n\n**3. Other Factors:**\n\n*   **Photosensitivity:**  Flashing lights or patterns (rare, but possible).\n*   **Genetic Predisposition:**  Even if your initial epilepsy didn't have a clear genetic cause, there might be a family history of epilepsy that increases your overall risk.\n\n\n\n**What Should You Do?**\n\n1.  **Talk to a Doctor (Neurologist):** This is the *most important* step.  Even though you've been seizure-free for a long time, it's essential to have a conversation with a neurologist. They can:\n    *   Review your medical history in detail.\n    *   Assess your individual risk based on the type of epilepsy you had, your age, and other factors.\n    *   Discuss potential triggers and how to avoid them.\n    *   Potentially recommend an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check your brain's electrical activity (though this may not be necessary if you're completely asymptomatic).\n2.  **Prioritize a Healthy Lifestyle:**  This is something you should do *regardless* of your risk.\n    *   **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 8-10 hours of quality sleep per night.\n    *   **Manage Stress:**  Develop healthy coping mechanisms for stress (exercise, meditation, mindfulness, hobbies, talking to friends/family).\n    *   **Avoid Alcohol and Drugs:**  This is crucial.\n    *   **Stay Hydrated:**  Drink plenty of water.\n    *   **Eat a Balanced Diet:**  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n3. **Be Aware of Seizure First Aid:**  Even if the risk is low, it\u2019s good to know what to do if you or someone else experiences a seizure.  (There are resources online for seizure first aid from organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation - see below).\n4. **Inform People You Trust:** Let close friends, family members, and roommates know about your epilepsy history and what to do if you were to have a seizure.\n\n**Don't Panic, But Be Proactive:**\n\nYou've had a long remission, which is a very positive sign.  However, being informed and proactive is the best way to protect your health and well-being.  The vast majority of people with childhood epilepsy in remission live full, normal lives.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n*   **CDC Epilepsy:** [https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html)\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably very worrying for your sister, and you're a good sibling to be trying to help gather information. This situation is complex, and it's good the doctor is at least acknowledging it's \"interesting\" rather than dismissing it. Here's a breakdown of potential causes, the ice cream connection, and what further investigation might look like.  I will add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.\n\n**Understanding What Happened \u2013 It Doesn't Sound *Typical* Seizure**\n\nWhile the convulsing legs *can* be part of a seizure, the whole picture \u2013 the stillness, the \"falling asleep\" sensation, the quick recovery and asking \"what was that\" \u2013 doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a typical seizure profile.  Classic seizures often involve a loss of awareness *during* the event, not necessarily a clear moment of regaining consciousness immediately afterward. The post-ictal phase (after a seizure) is usually marked by confusion and drowsiness, not a clear \"what just happened?\" question. This is a key detail.\n\n**Possible Explanations (Beyond a Standard Seizure)**\n\nHere's a look at possibilities, broken down with explanations and how they tie to the symptoms:\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope (Common Fainting):** This is the most likely explanation, *especially* given the triggers.  It happens when your body overreacts to certain triggers, causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to fainting. \n    * **Triggers:**  Emotional stress (a collision, even a playful one), pain (the \"headache\" could be a precursor to this), and even things like straining during a bowel movement or prolonged standing can trigger it.  The sudden cold from ice cream *could* contribute by affecting nerves that regulate blood pressure.\n    * **Symptoms:**  Often involves a feeling of warmth, nausea, dizziness, a pale complexion, and then loss of consciousness.  Sometimes there\u2019s a brief period of muscle twitching or jerking as blood flow returns.\n    * **Why it fits:**  The falling, the brief loss of consciousness, and the quick recovery all align. The previous episodes are a strong indicator.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up or changing position quickly.  While usually happens when *getting up*, a change in position while seated (or even relaxing too deeply) could potentially contribute, especially in a child.\n* **Migraine (with Atypical Presentation):** Some migraines, especially in children, can present with unusual symptoms like loss of consciousness or transient neurological symptoms. The headache is a clue, but not all migraines have a strong headache.\n* **Paroxysmal Dystonia:** This is a less common possibility but it's characterized by brief, involuntary muscle contractions or spasms.  It could explain the leg movements. It's often genetic, but can also be sporadic.\n* **Reflex Anoxic Seizures (also Risk Factor Related Seizures):** These happen in response to a trigger like pain, fear, or excitement. They\u2019re more common in young children. The reaction is an immediate slowing or stopping of the heart, causing a brief loss of consciousness.\n* **Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood:**  This causes episodes of dizziness, imbalance, and sometimes vomiting, and *can* sometimes cause falls.\n* **Cardiac Arrhythmia (Rare):** A temporary irregular heartbeat could, in rare cases, cause a loss of consciousness.  This is less likely given the EEG was normal, but shouldn't be completely ruled out.\n\n\n\n**The Ice Cream Connection: What's Going On?**\n\nThis is the perplexing part. Here's how ice cream/sugar/dairy *could* be involved:\n\n* **Brain Freeze (Sphenopalatine Ganglioneuralgia):**  While normally causing head pain, a very intense brain freeze *could* theoretically trigger a vasovagal response in a sensitive individual.  The sudden stimulus to the nerves in the head could lead to a drop in blood pressure.\n* **Sugar Rush/Drop:**  The rapid rise and fall in blood sugar after consuming a lot of sugar *can* potentially cause feelings of lightheadedness and weakness, but is very rarely associated with a loss of consciousness like this.\n* **Dairy Sensitivity/Allergy:** A severe dairy allergy *could* cause a drop in blood pressure (anaphylaxis), but this would usually be accompanied by other symptoms like hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.  It sounds like this is unlikely, as the episodes aren't consistently accompanied by these allergic signs.\n* **The Ritual/Association:**  Sometimes, a specific activity (like eating ice cream) becomes associated with a particular physical or emotional state.  This is a more psychological and less well-understood possibility, but could explain why it keeps happening with ice cream.\n\n**Why the EEG Was Normal**\n\nAn EEG measures brain *electrical activity*.  It's excellent at detecting *epileptic* seizures. But it *doesn't* rule out all the other potential causes listed above.  Vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and other conditions don\u2019t necessarily show up on an EEG.\n\n\n\n**What Your Sister Should Do \u2013 Next Steps**\n\n1. **Detailed Diary:**  She needs to keep a very detailed log of *everything* surrounding these episodes. This includes:\n    * What and how much ice cream (or other sugary/dairy items) was consumed.\n    * What was happening *before* the episode (e.g., excited, upset, moving, resting, etc.).\n    * Any preceding symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, feeling warm).\n    * The exact sequence of events during the episode.\n    * How long the episode lasted.\n    * How your niece felt afterward.\n2. **Follow-Up with Pediatrician (Crucial):**  \"Interesting\" isn't a diagnosis! Your sister needs to discuss these episodes *in detail* with the pediatrician and ask for further investigation. \n3. **Consider a Tilt Table Test:** This test is used to assess how a person\u2019s heart rate and blood pressure respond when they change position.  It\u2019s helpful in diagnosing vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension.\n4. **Cardiac Evaluation:** The pediatrician *may* recommend an EKG (electrocardiogram) to check for any underlying heart rhythm abnormalities.\n5. **Neurologist Referral (Possibly):** If the pediatrician is concerned, or if the episodes continue, a referral to a pediatric neurologist is a good idea. They can consider other possible causes and perform more specialized testing.\n6. **Hydration & Diet:** Ensure your niece is well-hydrated and has a balanced diet, avoiding excessive sugar intake.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It\u2019s a stressful situation, but with diligent investigation, you can hopefully get to the bottom of what's happening and ensure your niece is safe and well."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this sounds like a really difficult combination of symptoms, and it's good you're paying attention to them.  It's *very* important you get this checked by a doctor as soon as possible.  I'll break down the issues, why they might be connected, and then *strongly* emphasize the need for medical evaluation.  I will also add a disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.\n\n**Let's look at the symptoms individually, and potential connections:**\n\n* **Swollen Lymph Node (Left Side of Neck):** This is a key symptom that needs investigation.  Possible causes include:\n    * **Infection:**  Viral (like a common cold, flu, or mononucleosis) or bacterial infections are common causes.\n    * **Ear Infection:** Since you have ear symptoms, this is a strong possibility. An ear infection can cause a swollen lymph node on the same side of the neck.\n    * **Other Infections:**  Less common, but things like strep throat or even dental infections could be involved.\n    * **Less Common, More Serious:**  While less likely, swollen lymph nodes can sometimes indicate more serious issues, which is why a doctor needs to rule these out.\n* **Hearing Loss & Blocked Ears:**  This combined with the lymph node suggests an ear issue is very plausible.  Possibilities include:\n    * **Ear Infection (Otitis Media or Otitis Externa):** Inflammation and fluid build-up in the middle or outer ear.\n    * **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:**  The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the throat - if it's blocked, it can cause fullness, muffled hearing, and pain.\n    * **Earwax Build-up:**  Simple, but possible.\n    * **Less Common:**  More serious causes of hearing loss need to be ruled out by a specialist.\n* **Headache:**  Headaches are very non-specific, but can be related to:\n    * **Infection/Inflammation:**  The ear issue or a systemic infection could cause a headache.\n    * **Tension:**  Stress and lack of sleep can contribute to tension headaches.\n    * **Sinus Issues:** Sometimes ear and sinus problems are connected.\n    * **Medication Side Effects:** (See below)\n* **Loss of Appetite & Difficulty Sleeping:** These often go hand-in-hand and can be related to:\n    * **Depression:**  A common symptom of depression is changes in appetite and sleep.\n    * **Pain/Discomfort:**  The headache and ear discomfort could be disrupting your sleep and appetite.\n    * **Anxiety:**  Feeling unwell can lead to anxiety, which worsens sleep and appetite.\n    * **Medication Side Effects:** (See below)\n\n**How your medications might be playing a role:**\n\n* **Lamotrigine:**  Commonly used for epilepsy and mood stabilization. Side effects can include headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and *sometimes* sleep disturbances.  Rarely, it can affect the immune system, potentially making you more susceptible to infections.\n* **Clozapam (Clonazepam):** A benzodiazepine used for anxiety and sometimes seizures.  Side effects include drowsiness, fatigue, and *decreased* appetite.  It can make you feel generally unwell and contribute to sleep problems. *Important:* Suddenly stopping clonazepam can be dangerous; you need medical supervision to adjust or discontinue it.\n\n\n\n**The Autism & Epilepsy Connection**\n\nIt's important to mention that autism and epilepsy frequently co-occur.  This doesn't necessarily *cause* your current symptoms, but it's important information for your doctor to know, as it can influence how they approach diagnosis and treatment.  Also, stress and changes in routine \u2013 often challenging for individuals with autism \u2013 can exacerbate both epilepsy and depression.\n\n**Why You Need to See a Doctor *Immediately***\n\n* **Ruling out serious causes:**  The swollen lymph node and hearing loss need to be investigated to rule out anything serious.\n* **Medication Interactions and Side Effects:** Your doctor needs to assess whether your symptoms are related to your medications, a combination of medications, or something else entirely.  They may need to adjust your dosages or consider alternative treatments.\n* **Complex Picture:**  You have multiple symptoms and pre-existing conditions (autism, epilepsy, depression).  A doctor needs to consider all of these factors.\n* **Severity:** Loss of appetite and sleep are significant symptoms that can worsen your overall health.\n\n\n\n**What a doctor might do:**\n\n* **Physical Exam:**  Check your ears, throat, lymph nodes, and neurological function.\n* **Blood Tests:** To look for signs of infection, inflammation, or other underlying conditions. (Complete Blood Count (CBC) would be a good start.)\n* **Hearing Test (Audiogram):** To assess the nature and extent of your hearing loss.\n* **Ear Examination:** May use an otoscope to visualise the ear canal and eardrum.\n* **Imaging (Possibly):** Depending on the exam findings, the doctor may order a CT scan or MRI of your head or neck to get a better look at the structures in that area. (Less likely as a first step, but possible.)\n* **Review Medications:** A thorough review of your medications for potential side effects and interactions.\n\n\n\n**What to tell your doctor:**\n\n* **All your symptoms:**  Be specific about when they started, how they've changed, and what makes them better or worse.\n* **Your medical history:**  Including your autism, epilepsy, depression, and all medications you're taking (including dosages).\n* **Any recent illnesses or exposures:**  Have you been sick recently? Been around anyone who was sick? Any recent travel?\n* **Your concerns:**  Don't hesitate to express your worries.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex history and you've been through the wringer trying to figure this out! You're very smart to be an advocate for yourself and question diagnoses, and to consider potential underlying mechanisms. Let's break down the possibilities, given everything you've described.  I'll offer thoughts on your hypotheses, things often overlooked, and potential further investigation.  **Important disclaimer at the end \u2013 I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* continue working with your physician.**\n\n**Recap of Key Points:**\n\n* **Age of Onset:** Early 40s, coinciding with weight training (specifically pull-ups).\n* **Trigger:** Specifically linked to exercise, particularly pull-ups and heavy lifting.\n* **Symptoms:** Lightheadedness, near-syncope/actual loss of consciousness.\n* **Initial Diagnosis:** Epilepsy (neurologist), refuted by Epilepsy Foundation Director.\n* **Extensive Testing:** Cardiac workup inconclusive.\n* **Current Status:** Episodes have ceased with modification of exercise, consistent PPI use for GERD/hiatal hernia.\n* **Your Theories:** Vagus nerve involvement, PPI-related nutrient deficiencies.\n\n\n\n**Let\u2019s Analyze Your Theories \u2013 & Add Some Considerations:**\n\n**1. Vagus Nerve & Hiatal Hernia Connection (Highly plausible)**\n\nYou're absolutely right to consider this.  The vagus nerve has many functions, including controlling heart rate and blood pressure. It runs close to the esophagus and can be irritated by a hiatal hernia, especially during increased abdominal pressure related to exertion. Here's how it could work:\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the most likely mechanism.  The vagus nerve is *overstimulated* (perhaps by the pressure during the pull-up, combined with the hiatal hernia\u2019s influence), causing a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to lightheadedness and fainting.  Pull-ups, with the increased intra-abdominal pressure, are a classic trigger.\n* **Esophageal Discomfort/Spasm:**  The hiatal hernia might cause discomfort (even subtle) during exertion, which, in turn, could trigger a vagal response.\n* **Not \"Epilepsy\":** This makes *so* much sense as to why the Epilepsy Foundation Director discounted that diagnosis.  True epileptic seizures are electrical malfunctions in the brain, and your situation sounds much more physiological.\n\n**2. PPI-Related Nutrient Deficiencies (Also plausible, but less directly explanatory)**\n\nLong-term PPI use *can* reduce the absorption of certain nutrients, most notably:\n\n* **Magnesium:**  A common deficiency with PPIs.  Low magnesium can contribute to arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and general weakness \u2013 all of which *could* make someone more susceptible to lightheadedness during exertion.\n* **Vitamin B12:**  Also potentially affected, which could lead to fatigue and neurological symptoms.\n* **Iron:** Less common, but possible.  Iron deficiency anemia could contribute to feeling faint.\n* **Calcium:** Reduced absorption can affect muscle function.\n\nThese deficiencies *could* lower your overall resilience and make you more prone to experiencing symptoms when stressed by exercise. *However,* it's less likely to be the primary cause if the episodes are so specifically linked to pull-ups.  It's more likely a contributing factor.\n\n**3. Other Possibilities/Things to Consider:**\n\n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):**  This is often overlooked. POTS involves a problem with blood returning from the legs to the heart, leading to a rapid increase in heart rate (tachycardia) upon standing or exertion.  It can cause lightheadedness and fainting.  Even if initial cardiac tests were normal, a \"tilt table test\" is specifically done to diagnose POTS.\n* **Cardiac Arrhythmia (Intermittent):** While you've had cardiac testing, occasional, exercise-induced arrhythmias can be difficult to catch on a standard EKG.  A **Holter monitor** (worn for 24-48 hours) or an **event monitor** (worn for longer, activated when you feel symptoms) might be helpful.\n* **Dehydration:** Even mild dehydration can worsen symptoms, especially during exercise.\n* **Blood Sugar Fluctuations:**  Very subtle imbalances in blood sugar, especially if you exercise on an empty stomach, can contribute to lightheadedness.\n* **Exercise-Induced Hypotension:** A drop in blood pressure *after* exercise, which can sometimes be delayed.  However, this usually happens *after* stopping, not *during* pull-ups.\n* **Thoracic Outlet Syndrome:** (Less likely, but worth considering depending on your arm/shoulder positioning during pull-ups.) Compression of nerves and blood vessels in the space between your collarbone and first rib could cause lightheadedness.\n\n\n\n**What Should You Discuss with Your Doctor?**\n\n1. **Revisit the Vagus Nerve/Hiatal Hernia Angle:**  Specifically ask your doctor about vasovagal syncope as a likely diagnosis.  They may recommend things like:\n    * **Increased hydration:** Before, during, and after exercise.\n    * **Compression socks:** To help with venous return.\n    * **Slowly increasing exertion:** Gradual return to exercise intensity.\n    * **Avoiding holding your breath during lifting:**  The Valsalva maneuver (holding your breath) significantly increases intra-abdominal pressure.\n\n2. **Nutrient Level Testing:** Request blood tests to check:\n    * **Magnesium**\n    * **Vitamin B12**\n    * **Iron (including ferritin)**\n    * **Calcium**\n    * **Vitamin D** (often low with GERD, and important for overall health)\n\n    If deficiencies are found, discuss supplementation. *However,* don\u2019t self-treat without medical guidance.\n\n3. **Consider a Tilt Table Test:**  To rule out POTS.\n\n4. **Extended Cardiac Monitoring (Holter/Event Monitor):** To look for intermittent arrhythmias that might be linked to exercise.\n\n5. **Review All Medications:**  To identify any potential side effects that could contribute.\n\n6. **Discuss a VERY Gradual Reintroduction of Pull-ups:**  *Under medical guidance*, and with careful monitoring of symptoms.  Perhaps start with assisted pull-ups (using a band or machine) and build up very slowly.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I wanted to share my experience with you to maybe get some more information about my situation.For 10 years, I have been experiencing every couple of months sudden deja vu like feeling followed by dissociation. I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that's a really helpful description of what you're experiencing, and it's good you've been tracking it for 10 years. It's also smart to question whether it's *just* anxiety, especially given the seemingly random onset. Here's a breakdown of possibilities, information, and what you might consider doing next.  I'll try to be thorough, but **please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding What You Describe**\n\n* **Deja Vu:** The feeling of having already experienced a present situation. It\u2019s surprisingly common, with estimates suggesting around 60-70% of people experience it at some point.  Brief, infrequent deja vu is generally considered normal.\n* **Dissociation:**  This is a broader term, and what you describe sounds like a mild form. Dissociation is a feeling of detachment from yourself, your thoughts, your surroundings, or your emotions.  It's like a feeling of unreality. Since you don't report loss of identity or memory, it sounds like a milder form, but persistent dissociation *is* something to investigate.\n* **The Combination & Pattern:**  The *sequence* of deja vu *followed by* dissociation, occurring every couple of months for a decade, is what makes this more noteworthy than *just* occasional deja vu. This recurring pattern suggests it\u2019s likely linked to an underlying mechanism.  The 20-minute duration is also a useful detail.\n* **\"Sudden and not related to stress\":** This is the biggest clue that challenges a simple 'anxiety' explanation.  While anxiety can absolutely trigger these feelings, the fact they happen seemingly at random is important.  This doesn't *rule out* anxiety, but it suggests it might not be the *direct* cause, or that the anxiety might be operating at a deeper, less consciously-felt level.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes (Beyond Just General Anxiety)**\n\nLet's break down things that could be at play. I'll categorize these.\n\n**1. Neurological Possibilities (Less Common, but Important to Consider)**\n\n* **Simple Partial Seizures:** This is often the first thing doctors consider with recurring, unusual sensations like this, *especially* when they don't involve a full loss of consciousness.  These seizures don't always present as dramatic convulsions.  They can manifest as altered sensory perception (like deja vu, unusual smells, tastes), emotional shifts, or a feeling of detachment.  The cyclical nature you describe could fit.  **This doesn't mean you're having epilepsy, but it needs to be considered.**\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines don't involve just headache. They can have \"auras,\" which are neurological symptoms *before* the headache starts. Auras can include visual disturbances, sensory changes, or feelings of unreality. While you don't mention headaches, some people experience migraine auras without a significant headache.\n* **Rare Neurological Conditions:** There are rarer conditions affecting temporal lobe function (the part of the brain often associated with deja vu and memory) that could be considered, but these are far less likely.\n\n**2. Psychological / Psychiatric Possibilities**\n\n* **Anxiety (Complex Relationship):** While you may not *feel* stressed when these happen, your anxiety could be operating at a subconscious level. Chronic anxiety changes brain chemistry over time and can make someone more susceptible to these types of experiences.  It could be a kind of 'background noise' making you more vulnerable.\n* **Dissociative Disorders (Mild Spectrum):**  You don't describe symptoms of a full-blown dissociative disorder (like Dissociative Identity Disorder or Dissociative Amnesia).  However, it's possible you're experiencing a milder form of dissociation that's not necessarily tied to trauma (see point 3). This is often called \"subclinical dissociation.\"\n* **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder:**  These can sometimes present with feelings of detachment and unreality. Although you don't report persistent symptoms, the episodes could be brief manifestations.\n\n**3.  Past Experiences (Even if Not Consciously Remembered)**\n\n* **Subtle Trauma:**  Sometimes, earlier experiences (even ones that didn't feel *overtly* traumatic at the time) can lead to subconscious emotional responses and dissociation. It doesn't have to be major trauma; small, repeated stresses in childhood, for example, can have lasting effects.  The brain can \"disconnect\" as a coping mechanism.  This is often below conscious awareness.\n* **Early Attachment Issues:**  Difficulties in early childhood relationships can sometimes contribute to dissociation as a way of coping with emotional distress.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do Next (and Questions to Ask Yourself)**\n\n1. **See a Doctor \u2013 Essential First Step:**  *This is the most important thing.* Explain to a doctor (preferably your primary care physician) *exactly* what you\u2019ve detailed here. Be specific about the sequence of events (deja vu *then* dissociation), the duration, the frequency, and the fact that they seem unrelated to stress.  **Specifically ask about the possibility of neurological causes, like simple partial seizures.**  Your doctor may refer you to a neurologist.\n\n2. **Neurological Evaluation:** If your doctor suspects a neurological issue, you'll likely need:\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  This tests your brain's electrical activity and can help detect seizure activity. *Multiple* EEGs over time are often more informative than just one.\n    * **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** This provides detailed images of your brain and can rule out structural abnormalities.\n\n3. **Mental Health Professional (Psychologist or Psychiatrist):**  Even if neurological causes are ruled out, seeing a therapist is a good idea.\n    * **Thorough Assessment:** A good therapist will conduct a thorough assessment of your anxiety, your history, and the specifics of these episodes.\n    * **Explore Potential Triggers:** They can help you explore if there might be underlying emotional or psychological factors you haven't consciously recognized.  EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) can sometimes be helpful for addressing underlying trauma, even subtle trauma.\n    * **Coping Strategies:** They can teach you coping strategies for managing the dissociation when it happens.\n\n4. **Keep a Detailed Log:**  Continue to meticulously track each episode:\n    * **Date and Time**\n    * **What were you doing *immediately* before the deja vu?** (Be very specific \u2013 even seemingly insignificant details)\n    * **What was the environment like?** (Lighting, sounds, smells, people present)\n    * **What was your emotional state *right* before?** (Even if you didn't *feel* stressed, try to identify any subtle emotions \u2013 boredom, slight unease, anticipation, etc.)\n    * **How did the deja vu *feel* exactly?** (Strong? Faint? Familiar?)\n    * **How did the dissociation feel?** (Detachment from self? From surroundings? Emotional numbing?)\n    * **How long did each phase last?**\n    * **What, if anything, seemed to help it resolve?**\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is *extremely* compelling. The simultaneous cessation of symptoms across three living beings the moment you left the location is a huge red flag. You're right to be suspicious, and ruling out psychosomatic explanations is a smart move. Here's a breakdown of potential causes, what to do, and why it's good you're taking this seriously.  I'll categorize them, from more likely (but still concerning) to less likely but possible.  **Disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical or professional environmental hazard diagnosis. This is information to help you explore possibilities and gather information.**\n\n**I. Environmental Hazards (Most Likely)**\n\nThis is where I\u2019d focus the bulk of your investigation. The fact that *all three* of you stopped being sick when you moved is powerfully indicative of something in the *environment* of that basement suite.\n\n*   **Carbon Monoxide (CO):**  This is the first thing you *must* investigate. Basements are notorious for CO buildup, especially if there are gas appliances (furnace, water heater, stove) nearby, or if a car was ever run in an attached garage. Even a small, chronic leak can cause nausea, headaches, and fatigue.  It doesn't always smell like anything. \n    *   **Action:** Get CO detectors immediately (even if you\u2019ve now moved!). See if you can find records of CO inspections done on the property.  Contact the local fire department to see if they can do a CO check of the old property (they may or may not depending on local regulations).\n*   **Mold:** Mold is a very common basement issue, and certain types produce mycotoxins that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, headaches, and neurological issues.  You\u2019ve had neurological symptoms (epilepsy), which make mold a strong consideration.\n    *   **Action:**  Professional Mold Inspection. Don't attempt to remove mold yourself, as it can release spores.  A professional can identify the type of mold and the extent of the contamination.\n*   **Radon:** A radioactive gas that seeps up from the ground. It's odorless and colorless and can be a concern in basements.  Long-term exposure can cause lung cancer, but shorter-term exposure can also cause nausea and other symptoms.\n    *   **Action:** Radon Testing.  Relatively inexpensive and easy to do. Radon test kits are available at hardware stores or you can hire a professional.\n*   **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):**  These are chemicals emitted from paints, cleaning products, building materials, furniture, and even air fresheners.  Basements can trap VOCs, especially if poorly ventilated. Recent renovations or new furniture in the suite could contribute.\n    *   **Action:**  Difficult to pinpoint without testing.  A professional indoor air quality assessment can check for VOCs.\n*   **Sewage/Sewer Gas:**  If there were plumbing issues or a leak in a sewer line near the basement, sewer gases can seep into the building.  This can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness.  \n    *   **Action:** Look for any evidence of past plumbing problems. A professional plumber can inspect the sewer lines.\n\n**II. Less Common, but Possible**\n\n*   **Metal Contamination:** (Lead, Arsenic, etc.) If the building is old, there's a possibility of lead paint or other metal contamination in the soil surrounding the foundation.\n    *   **Action:** Soil testing.\n*   **Underground Storage Tanks (USTs):**  Were there ever any fuel tanks on the property (even if removed)? Leaks from USTs can contaminate the soil and groundwater.\n*   **Previous Use of the Property:** What was the building used for *before* it was a residence? (e.g., dry cleaner, auto shop, industrial space). Previous uses could have left behind contaminants.\n\n**III. Why the Cat?**\n\nThe cat's involvement is crucial. Animals are often more sensitive to environmental toxins than humans, which explains why he was also affected.  His symptoms could be a very strong indicator of a problem.\n\n\n\n**What You Need To Do (Now)**\n\n1.  **Document Everything:**  Keep a detailed log of your symptoms, when they started, and the duration.  Also document the cat's symptoms.  This will be invaluable if you pursue further investigation.\n2.  **Immediate Testing (Priority):**\n    *   **CO Detectors:** Install in your new home, even as a precaution.\n    *   **Radon Test:**  Order a kit for the old property.\n    *   **Mold Inspection:**  Hire a professional to inspect the old property.\n3.  **Inform the Relevant Parties (as you're planning):**\n    *   **Current Owner:** They have a legal and ethical obligation to address any hazards.\n    *   **Real Estate Agent:** They should be informed of the potential issue.\n    *   **New Tenants:**  Absolutely essential to protect them.\n4.  **Legal Advice:** Consult with a lawyer specializing in environmental law or tenant rights. They can advise you on your legal options and help you navigate the process of holding the property owner accountable.\n5. **Your Health:** Share this history with your neurologist. They may want to re-evaluate your epilepsy treatment.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't downplay your experience.** The simultaneous improvement in your health and your cat's health is significant.\n*   **Be persistent.** You may encounter resistance from the property owner.\n*   **Don't give up on finding an answer.** Protecting your health and the health of others is paramount.\n\n\n\nYou're doing the right thing by questioning what happened. Trust your instincts\u2014you and your family were clearly affected by something in that house.  I really hope you get answers and can prevent others from experiencing the same thing.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **EPA (Environmental Protection Agency):** [https://www.epa.gov/](https://www.epa.gov/)\n*   **CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention):** [https://www.cdc.gov/](https://www.cdc.gov/)\n*   **Local Health Department:** Can provide information on local environmental hazards and testing resources.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. I'm here to help in any way I can."

        "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot, and you're understandably worried. Let's break it down as thoroughly as possible.  I'm going to be direct, and will address your specific concerns.  **Important Disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**First, let's address the \"have I given myself epilepsy?\" question:**  It's *unlikely* you've induced epilepsy from this single incident, but it's **impossible to say for sure without proper medical evaluation.** Your fear is valid, but jumping to that conclusion isn't helpful right now.  While a single trigger *can* sometimes reveal an underlying predisposition to epilepsy (meaning you already had a vulnerability you weren't aware of), the scenario you describe \u2013 a single episode of substance use leading to *sustained, daily* twitching and zaps for two months \u2013 is less typical for a first-time epileptic event. Epileptic seizures are usually more dramatic, and don't typically resolve slowly like this.\n\n**What's going on \u2013 a probable explanation, and why:**\n\nYour interpretation that this is related to a combination of serotonin syndrome and fluoxetine discontinuation syndrome is the *most likely* explanation, but, again, needs doctor confirmation. Here's a more detailed look:\n\n* **Serotonin Syndrome (Mild):** The combination of fluoxetine (an SSRI), kratom (which affects serotonin and opioid systems), and THC *could* have created a situation where serotonin levels became too high. While it doesn\u2019t sound like you had the full-blown, life-threatening presentation of serotonin syndrome (high fever, agitation, etc), a milder form is very possible.  Even mild serotonin syndrome can disrupt neurological function.\n* **Fluoxetine Discontinuation Syndrome:**  Stopping fluoxetine \"cold turkey\" after even a short period of use *will* cause withdrawal symptoms.  The \"brain zaps\" are a hallmark of this.  This syndrome can also cause anxiety, insomnia, and (importantly) muscle twitching.\n* **The Interplay:**  The serotonin syndrome episode, even if mild, likely *sensitized* your nervous system. Then, abruptly stopping the fluoxetine on top of that made things even worse. The two problems magnified each other.\n* **Why it's lingering:** Your nervous system is likely still recovering from this double hit. It\u2019s attempting to re-regulate serotonin and other neurotransmitter levels.  The fact that it's improving is a good sign, but the recovery isn\u2019t linear.  Stress, fatigue, and stimulants like caffeine can exacerbate symptoms.\n\n\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Symptoms:**\n\n* **Myoclonus (Twitching):** This is very common in both fluoxetine discontinuation and can be a symptom of mild serotonin syndrome.  The fact that it happens only when resting is typical. It's suggestive of nervous system hyperexcitability.\n* **Brain Zaps:** Again, strongly indicative of fluoxetine withdrawal.\n* **Focus Issues with Twitching:**  This is understandable. Any sudden physical sensation/movement will interrupt your concentration.\n* **Improvement over Time:** The fact that it's gradually getting better is a *very* good sign. It suggests your nervous system is healing.\n* **Worsening with Coffee:** Caffeine is a stimulant and can absolutely worsen both twitching and anxiety related to withdrawal.\n\n**Your Concerns About \"Seizures\":**\n\nYou are *not* likely experiencing generalized seizures. The description of your symptoms - twitching only when resting, gradual onset and improvement, the presence of brain zaps - doesn\u2019t align with the typical presentation of epilepsy.  These are more characteristic of focal neurological symptoms from withdrawal/dysregulation. *However,* the *possibility* of a subclinical seizure (a seizure without obvious convulsions) cannot be ruled out without testing. That's why a medical evaluation is key.\n\n**Why You Need to See a Doctor (and it\u2019s more urgent than you think):**\n\n* **Rule Out Other Causes:** While the most probable explanation is as described above, a doctor needs to rule out other possible causes of myoclonus (electrolyte imbalances, magnesium deficiency, other neurological conditions \u2013 though these are less likely given the timeline and history).\n* **Confirm the Diagnosis:** A doctor can accurately diagnose fluoxetine discontinuation syndrome and assess the likelihood of a past mild serotonin syndrome episode.\n* **Manage Anxiety:** Your anxiety is clearly high. A doctor can discuss strategies for managing that, and potentially prescribe something to help with symptoms while your brain recovers.\n* **Potential Need for Testing:**  An EEG (electroencephalogram) can measure brain activity and help identify any abnormal patterns, though it\u2019s not always conclusive.  Blood tests can rule out other causes.\n* **Peace of Mind:**  You\u2019re experiencing significant anxiety, and a professional evaluation will provide you with reassurance (or a clear path forward if there is something else going on).\n\n**Regarding Getting an Appointment:**\n\nYou mentioned difficulty getting a GP appointment.  Here are some options:\n\n* **Urgent Care:**  This is a good option, *especially* if your symptoms are worsening or interfering with your daily life. Explain the history thoroughly.\n* **Telemedicine:** Many telemedicine services can provide an initial evaluation and potentially prescribe medication for anxiety/withdrawal symptoms.\n* **University Hospitals/Clinics:** Often have more readily available appointments and may offer sliding scale fees.\n* **Community Health Centers:** Another option for affordable care.\n\n**What you can do *now*:**\n\n* **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol:** These will make things worse.\n* **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can exacerbate symptoms.\n* **Prioritize Sleep:**  Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n* **Manage Stress:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My little sister, age 12, was diagnosed with epilepsy for the last 1 year. She has been taking necessary medications for its cure and prevention. However, she has been ill for the last few days and we ran a few tests waiting to get reports tomorrow. It's 3am now and she has been acting and moving her body weirdly while sleeping for the last hour, we're suspecting she's having nocturnal epilepsy. Moreover, she has been telling us she feels tremor in her stomach for the past 3 days. It would be really nice if anyone could answer the following questions    What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?    What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or preventions?    What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?    What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably a very frightening situation. It's good you're being proactive and seeking information. It's vitally important to remember I am *not* a medical professional and this information is *not* a substitute for professional medical advice. You are doing the right thing waiting for the test reports and following up with her neurologist.  I'll address your questions as thoroughly as possible, but **please prioritize getting guidance from her doctor.**\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** *Because your sister is actively experiencing unusual movements and you suspect nocturnal seizures, and you're awaiting test results, **you should be prepared to call emergency services (your local emergency number) if her symptoms worsen or if this episode is prolonged.** A prolonged seizure is generally considered to be one lasting longer than 5 minutes.*\n\n\n\n**1. What could be the general cause of any epilepsy such as this?**\n\nEpilepsy isn't a single disease, but rather a tendency to have recurrent seizures. The causes are diverse and often, in many cases, the exact cause remains unknown (this is called idiopathic epilepsy). Here's a breakdown of potential causes, categorized:\n\n* **Genetic Factors:**  A family history of epilepsy increases the risk.  Specific genetic mutations can be identified in some cases, but often it's a combination of genes that contribute.\n* **Brain Structure Abnormalities:**  These can be present from birth (developmental abnormalities) or acquired later.  Examples include:\n    * **Hippocampal Sclerosis:**  Scarring in the hippocampus, a brain area crucial for memory, is a common finding in temporal lobe epilepsy (a common type).\n    * **Cortical Dysplasia:** Abnormal organization of the brain's outer layer (cortex).\n    * **Brain Tumors:** Though less common, tumors can disrupt brain activity.\n* **Head Injury:**  A traumatic brain injury (TBI), even a seemingly minor one, can sometimes lead to epilepsy years later.\n* **Stroke:**  Disruption of blood flow to the brain can cause damage that results in seizures.\n* **Infections:**  Brain infections like meningitis or encephalitis can cause epilepsy.\n* **Metabolic Disorders:**  Rarely, certain metabolic imbalances can trigger seizures.\n* **Autoimmune Disorders:** In some cases, the immune system can attack the brain.\n* **Unknown Cause (Idiopathic):**  As mentioned, many cases have no identifiable cause.\n\n**Nocturnal Epilepsy & Stomach Tremors:** The fact that this is happening during sleep *could* suggest a specific type of nocturnal epilepsy, but it\u2019s crucial to determine the exact seizure type with testing (EEG is key!).   The stomach tremors are interesting and could be several things *unrelated* to the epilepsy, but need to be investigated \u2013 possibly related to anxiety, gut motility issues, or even a side effect of medication. Bringing this up specifically with the doctor is important.\n\n\n\n\n**2. What precautions should we take as a family or her as an individual to ensure a speedy cure or prevention?**\n\n* **Adherence to Medication:**  This is *the most important thing*.  Ensure she takes her medication exactly as prescribed, at the same time(s) each day.  Never stop or adjust the medication without her doctor's guidance.\n* **Regular Neurologist Visits:** Ongoing monitoring is crucial.  The neurologist will assess her response to medication, adjust dosages if needed, and review her overall health.\n* **Lifestyle Management (see section 4):** This is preventative.\n* **Family Education:** Everyone in the family needs to be educated about epilepsy, seizure first aid, and what to do in an emergency. (See below).\n* **Identify & Avoid Triggers (if possible):** While many seizures happen spontaneously, some people find that certain things can increase their risk. Common triggers include:\n    * **Sleep Deprivation:** Very important for someone with nocturnal tendencies.\n    * **Stress:**  Manage stress through relaxation techniques, counseling, or enjoyable activities.\n    * **Illness/Fever:**  Illness can lower the seizure threshold. \n    * **Flashing Lights:** Though less common, this can be a trigger for photosensitive epilepsy. (avoid strobe lights, certain video games)\n    * **Alcohol/Drug Use** (obviously not applicable for a 12-year-old, but important for future awareness).\n* **Consider a Medical Alert Bracelet/Necklace:** This can provide crucial information to first responders if she has a seizure while away from family.\n\n**\"Cure\" vs. Control:**  It\u2019s important to understand that epilepsy is often *managed* rather than \u201ccured.\u201d  The goal is to achieve good seizure control with medication and lifestyle adjustments.  \n\n\n\n\n**3. What should we do or ensure when she has this during sleeping?**\n\nThis is the most immediate concern.\n\n* **Stay Calm:** Easier said than done, but your calmness will help everyone.\n* **Protect Her:** *Gently* ease her onto her side (this helps with airway management and prevents choking on saliva).  **Do NOT restrain her.** Let the seizure run its course.\n* **Clear the Area:** Remove any hard or sharp objects nearby to prevent injury.  Put something soft under her head.\n* **Time the Seizure:**  Note the *start time*.  This is crucial if you need to call emergency services.\n* **Observe & Note Details:**  What does the seizure look like? Which parts of the body are involved?  Is she making any sounds?  What happens immediately *before* and *after* the seizure? This information is valuable for her doctor.\n* **Do NOT Put Anything in Her Mouth:** This is an old myth and can cause injury.\n* **Stay with Her Until She\u2019s Fully Recovered:**  After a seizure, she may be confused, sleepy, or agitated.  Reassure her and help her orient herself.\n* **When to Call Emergency Services (911 or your local equivalent):**\n    * **Seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.** (Status Epilepticus \u2013 a medical emergency)\n    * **She has repeated seizures without regaining consciousness in between.**\n    * **She is injured during the seizure.**\n    * **She has difficulty breathing after the seizure.**\n    * **It\u2019s her first seizure.**\n    * **You are unsure what to do.**\n\n\n\n\n**4. What habits should be changed to reduce risks of serious injuries by epilepsy?**\n\n* **Sleep Hygiene:**  Prioritize consistent, adequate sleep.  A regular bedtime routine is helpful.\n* **Safe Activities:**\n    * **Swimming:** She should *only* swim with supervision and preferably not swim alone.  Discuss with the neurologist.\n    * **Biking/Skateboarding/Rollerblading:**  These activities carry a higher risk of head injury.  Helmets are absolutely essential. Consider if these are appropriate based on seizure control.\n    * **Climbing:**  Avoid activities like tree climbing or rock climbing.\n    * **Contact Sports:** Discuss with her physician.  These may need to be modified or avoided.\n* **Home Safety:**\n    * **Soft Flooring:** Rugs or carpet in areas where she spends a lot of time.\n    * **Rounded Furniture:**  Minimize sharp corners.\n    * **Avoid Cooking with Hot Liquids:**  Especially unsupervised.\n    * **Bathroom Safety:** Non-slip mats in the shower/tub.\n* **Emotional Well-being:** Epilepsy can be emotionally challenging. Encourage her to express her feelings and seek support from family, friends, or a therapist.  Address any anxiety or stress.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding the stomach tremors:**  Definitely mention this to the doctor.  It could be unrelated, but it\u2019s important to rule out any connection to her epilepsy or medications.\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou are a very caring sibling.  The fact that you are seeking information and being proactive is wonderful.  Remember, epilepsy is manageable.  Focus on working closely with her medical team, adhering to the treatment plan, and creating a safe and supportive environment for your sister.   \n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:**  [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **CDC Epilepsy Website:** [https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html)\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope your sister feels better soon, and you get clear answers from the test results.  Good luck.  Let me know if you have any other general questions (keeping in mind I am not a substitute for medical advice)."

        "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really thoughtful and well-articulated description of your situation. You're right to be proactive and research, and you're smart to question what's going on. It's frustrating when something is impacting your fitness goals and the explanation feels incomplete. Let's break down your situation, address hemiparesis, potential causes, and what you can do about it.  This is a lot of information, so I'll try to be thorough. **Please read the disclaimer at the end!**\n\n**Understanding Your Situation: The Links to Your History**\n\nYour history of an AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation) removal on the *right* side of your brain, followed by recurrence of seizures, and now this left-sided weakness is very relevant.  The fact that it only manifests with exertion, and isn\u2019t impacting your daily life much, is also an important detail.\n\n* **AVM & Surgery:** AVMs are abnormal tangles of blood vessels. Removing one, *especially* on the right side of the brain, can absolutely lead to weakness on the *left* side of the body. This is because the right side of the brain controls motor function on the left side. Even with careful surgery, damage to the motor cortex or pathways leading to it can occur. It's not always immediately apparent, and sometimes the effects develop or become more pronounced over time (years).\n* **Seizures:** Seizures, particularly if they affect the motor areas of the brain, can contribute to weakness and difficulty with movement.  Seizure activity can temporarily (and sometimes, with repeated events, more permanently) disrupt the brain's ability to control muscles. Clusters of seizures are particularly concerning in this regard.\n* **Delayed Onset:** The fact that this weakness developed *after* the initial recovery from surgery and later with seizure recurrence is a key point.  It suggests that the issue isn\u2019t just the initial surgical impact but potentially evolving changes related to the brain's recovery, or worsening control of the initial damage.\n\n\n\n**Hemiparesis \u2013 Is This Likely?**\n\nYou are very astute to consider hemiparesis.  **Hemiparesis *is* a definite possibility in your situation.** Hemiparesis literally means \"weakness on one side of the body.\"  It\u2019s often caused by damage to the motor pathways in the brain, brainstem or spinal cord.  \n\nHowever, it's not always a *full* hemiparesis (complete weakness).  You're describing a more subtle, exertion-dependent weakness. This is often referred to as *mild* or *incomplete* hemiparesis.\n\n* **Why it fits:** The location of your AVM, the side of weakness, the fact it\u2019s more evident with effort, and your history all align.\n* **Why your neurologist might not have explicitly labeled it:** Sometimes, the term 'hemiparesis' isn\u2019t used if the weakness is mild or doesn\u2019t fit a classic presentation.  Your doctor may have been addressing the neurological *cause* (the initial surgical area) without specifically naming the *symptom* (the weakness) as hemiparesis.  They may also be seeing it as a functional limitation resulting from the brain damage, rather than a standalone diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n**Other Possibilities (Less Likely, But Important to Consider)**\n\nWhile hemiparesis is the most likely explanation, a few other things are worth mentioning to be comprehensive:\n\n* **Subclinical Nerve Issues:**  While your neurologist ruled out scoliosis (which can sometimes pinch nerves), there could be subtle nerve impingements in your shoulder or neck (even without scoliosis) that are being *revealed* by the stress of weightlifting.  This is less likely, given the clear connection to your brain history, but possible.\n* **Proprioception Issues:** Proprioception is your body\u2019s sense of where it is in space. Damage to the brain can affect proprioception, which can lead to clumsiness and difficulty coordinating movements, especially under load. This could explain the trembling and \u201cfalling over\u201d feeling.\n* **Muscle Imbalance:**  The surgery and/or the weakness might have led to compensatory patterns of movement.  Over time, this can create muscle imbalances between your left and right sides, exacerbating the issue.\n\n\n\n\n**What Can You Do About It? A Multi-Pronged Approach**\n\nThe good news is \u2013 you\u2019re young, and the brain has remarkable plasticity.  While complete recovery might not be possible, significant improvement *is* achievable.  Here's what I recommend you pursue:\n\n1. **Revisit Neurology (Specifically Rehab Focus):**  I strongly advise seeking a second opinion from a neurologist who *specializes in neurorehabilitation*.  This is crucial.  Specifically ask for a referral to a physical therapist with expertise in neurological conditions (e.g., stroke rehabilitation, TBI rehabilitation).  Tell them about your weightlifting concerns explicitly.\n\n2. **Physical Therapy \u2013 Key to Improvement:** A skilled neuro-physical therapist can:\n   * **Assess:**  Conduct a detailed assessment of your strength, range of motion, coordination, proprioception, and movement patterns.\n   * **Develop a Targeted Program:** The program should focus on:\n      * **Strengthening:**  Start with very low weights and high repetitions, focusing on *proper form*. Progress extremely slowly.  Isometric exercises (holding a position without movement) may be a good starting point.\n      * **Proprioceptive Training:** Exercises to improve your body awareness and balance.\n      * **Motor Relearning:**  Techniques to \u201cretrain\u201d your brain to control the muscles on your left side more effectively.\n      * **Compensatory Pattern Correction:** Addressing any muscle imbalances that have developed.\n   * **Task-Specific Training:** This involves practicing the *specific* movements you want to improve (like shoulder presses and bicep curls) in a controlled and progressive manner.\n\n3. **Seizure Control:** Ensuring your seizures are well-controlled is paramount.  Uncontrolled seizures can worsen neurological deficits.  Work closely with your neurologist to optimize your medication regimen.  A seizure diary can be helpful to identify triggers or patterns.\n\n4. **Gradual Progression & Listen to Your Body:** *This is incredibly important.*  Don\u2019t push through pain or fatigue.  Start with exercises that are *well within* your capabilities and gradually increase the intensity and duration.  Overtraining will likely exacerbate your symptoms.\n\n5. **Consider Assistive Devices (Initially):**  For exercises like lat pulldowns or shoulder presses, consider using assistance bands or even starting with very light resistance machines to help stabilize your left side.\n\n6. **Neuroplasticity & Mindset:**  The brain is capable of rewiring itself.  Focus on quality of movement, visualization of success, and a positive mindset.  Be patient \u2013 progress may be slow and steady.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I\u2019m a 22 year old female and I have quite a track sheet of medical issues. I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m not sure if they are related and I really don\u2019t know which road to go down.I\u2019ve had ruptured ovarian cysts consistently since I was 12. every time I ovulate. I\u2019ve been on birth control since I was 13 because of that. I have insanely painful periods and I know my hormones are out of wack but I\u2019ve never been diagnosed officially with PCOS or endometriosis but I think I could have either one. not sure.I got diagnosed with epilepsy last February after two grand mal seizures on the same day. coincidentally(?) I had just gotten off birth control to try and heal my body naturally. my seizures seem to align with my menstrual cycle. I\u2019m on Keppra and it\u2019s controlling my tonic clonic seizures but I have breakthrough absence seizures 3x a week. originally my first EEG only showed right temporal lobe seizures but my most recent EEG showed right and left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe seizures.while I was in the epilepsy monitoring unit last week for a 7 day EEG during a pretty intense grand mal seizure my heart rate hit 275 bpm. I\u2019ve always felt little heart flutters but this was intense. I have a Holter monitor now, and I was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. I\u2019m getting an ablation next week. the flutters happen after every seizure but sometimes just on their own without seizure activity.can someone please help me connect the dots, or point me in the direction of someone who can help? I\u2019m really up for any suggestions right now because I want to go back to my normal life. thank you!",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. You are right to feel overwhelmed - that is a *lot* happening, and it's understandable you're looking for connections and a path forward. You're also smart to recognize the potential for things to be linked.  It's really good you're advocating for yourself and seeking answers. Here's a breakdown of how these things *could* be related, potential avenues to explore, and who you should be talking to.  This is *not* medical advice, but intended to give you frameworks for discussion with your doctors.\n\n**The Big Picture: Hormones, Neurology, and Cardiology - A Potential Interplay**\n\nYour story strongly suggests a potential interplay between hormonal fluctuations, neurological issues (epilepsy), and cardiovascular events (SVT).  There's growing research demonstrating these systems are more connected than traditionally thought. Here\u2019s how:\n\n* **Hormones & Seizures:**  Fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone are *very* impactful on neuronal excitability. Many women with epilepsy experience catamenial epilepsy \u2013 seizures clustered around their menstrual cycle. This is likely why your seizures are timed with your cycle.  Coming off birth control would have caused a more dramatic and rapid shift in these hormonal levels, potentially triggering your initial seizures.\n* **Hormones & Ovarian Cysts/Pain:** Your long history of ruptured cysts and painful periods, combined with potential PCOS/endometriosis, screams hormonal imbalance.  These conditions often involve excess androgens (male hormones) and irregular ovulation.\n* **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Dysregulation:** This is a *key* concept. The ANS controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and hormone release.  Frequent seizures, especially those involving the temporal lobe (involved in emotional processing and autonomic control), and hormonal fluctuations can *dysregulate* the ANS. This dysregulation can manifest as heart rate variability issues like SVT, palpitations, and even digestive problems.  The rapid heart rate during your seizure is a strong indicator of ANS involvement.\n* **Inflammation:** Chronic pain (from cysts/periods) and seizures can contribute to systemic inflammation. Inflammation can affect both the brain and the heart.\n\n\n\n**Breaking Down Each Area & Potential Investigations**\n\nLet's look at each of your conditions and suggestions for further investigation.  It sounds like you have some of this going on already, but it's about making sure all areas are being considered *together*.\n\n**1.  Gynecological (Ovarian Cysts, Painful Periods, PCOS/Endometriosis)**\n\n* **Formal Diagnosis:**  You *need* a definitive diagnosis of PCOS, endometriosis, or another underlying cause for your ovarian issues.  This requires:\n    * **Pelvic Exam:**  A thorough exam by a gynecologist.\n    * **Ultrasound:**  To visualize your ovaries and uterus.  A transvaginal ultrasound is often more detailed.\n    * **Hormone Panel:**  FSH, LH, testosterone (total and free), DHEA-S, estrogen, prolactin, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone - thyroid can affect hormones).  Consider testing for AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) which is helpful for PCOS diagnosis.\n    * **Laparoscopy (Possibly):** If other tests are inconclusive, a laparoscopy (surgical exploration) can be the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis.\n* **Consider a Gynecologist Specializing in Endometriosis/PCOS** \u2013 These conditions are often complex and require expertise.\n\n\n\n**2.  Neurology (Epilepsy/Seizures)**\n\n* **Continued EEG Monitoring:**  Follow the neurologist's recommendations, but emphasize the cyclical nature of your seizures.\n* **MRI with Specific Protocols:** A high-resolution MRI of the brain, specifically looking for subtle abnormalities (hippocampal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, etc.), is crucial.  Ask if a 3T MRI (stronger magnet) is available.\n* **Genetic Testing:**  Sometimes epilepsy has a genetic component.\n* **Neurologist specializing in Catamenial Epilepsy:** Seek a neurologist specifically experienced with seizures relating to the menstrual cycle.  This is *important.*\n* **Consider Anti-Epileptic Drug (AED) Side Effects:** Keppra, while effective, can sometimes worsen mood or have other side effects. Discuss this with your neurologist.\n\n**3.  Cardiology (SVT)**\n\n* **Ablation:** Getting the ablation is a good step to address the SVT directly - excellent that's scheduled!\n* **Holter Monitor Analysis:**  The Holter monitor data is crucial to understand *how* often the palpitations/SVT are occurring, and their relationship to seizures.\n* **Autonomic Function Testing:**  *This is critical.* Ask your cardiologist about autonomic function testing (such as a tilt table test or heart rate variability analysis). This will evaluate how well your ANS is working.\n* **Echocardiogram:**  To assess the structure and function of your heart.\n* **Cardiologist experienced with autonomic dysfunction:**  Finding a cardiologist familiar with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) or other forms of dysautonomia.\n\n\n\n**Key Specialists to Assemble: The Dream Team**\n\nThis situation is complex and truly requires a team approach.  Here's who you need on your side:\n\n1.  **A Highly Experienced Neurologist:**  Specializing in epilepsy, *particularly catamenial epilepsy*.\n2.  **A Gynecologist:**  Specializing in endometriosis/PCOS, or at least very knowledgeable about hormonal imbalances.\n3.  **A Cardiologist:**  Experienced in arrhythmias *and* autonomic dysfunction.  Someone who understands the connection between heart rate variability and neurological conditions.\n4. **Potentially an Endocrinologist**: If hormone imbalances are severe or complex, an endocrinologist can help further.\n\n**Important Communication:**\n\n*   **Tell Each Specialist Everything:**  Everyone needs the full picture!  Bring a detailed timeline of your symptoms and all of your medical records.\n*   **Centralized Medical Records:**  If possible, use a patient portal to share records easily between doctors.\n*  **Advocate for yourself**: Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek second opinions, and push for the investigations you believe are needed.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n*   **PCOS Awareness Association:**  [https://www.pcosaa.org/](https://www.pcosaa.org/)\n*   **Endometriosis Foundation of America:** [https://www.endofound.org/](https://www.endofound.org/)\n* **Dysautonomia International**: https://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/\n* **Epilepsy Foundation**:  https://www.epilepsy.com/\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nYou are facing a challenging situation, but you\u2019re doing the right thing by seeking answers.  Don\u2019t be discouraged if it takes time to get a clear diagnosis and effective treatment plan. It's likely there *are* connections between these conditions, and finding doctors who are willing to think holistically and collaborate will be crucial to getting you back to feeling like yourself.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "After standing from a prolonged period of sitting (especially when looking at a screen) I have 'episodes' which include spasms and staring. These occur multiple times a day, and I have had an ambulatory eeg. This has been happening for the last 4 years approximatelyThese came back to show that I don't have epilepsy, however my brain waves slow down and they suspect that I have mild cerebal hypoxia.My question is how bad is mild cerebal hypoxia because when severe, it can be very serious. Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and it's good you're asking questions and trying to understand what's happening. Let's break down your concerns about mild cerebral hypoxia, its implications, and what your next steps should be, keeping in mind I am an AI and this is *not* medical advice \u2013 it's information to help you prepare for conversations with your doctors.\n\n**Understanding Cerebral Hypoxia - From Mild to Severe**\n\nYou're right to be concerned about cerebral hypoxia. It *can* be very serious. The severity depends on *how much* oxygen is being reduced and for *how long*.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Severe Cerebral Hypoxia:** This is a medical emergency. It results in significant and rapid brain damage due to a critical lack of oxygen. This can lead to coma, persistent neurological deficits (like paralysis, speech issues), and even death. This is what immediately comes to mind for most people.\n* **Mild Cerebral Hypoxia:** This is where things get trickier.  It doesn't cause immediate, dramatic symptoms like severe hypoxia.  Instead, it can present with a range of more subtle, and often intermittent, symptoms. Your episodes \u2013 spasms and staring, triggered by postural changes and screen time \u2013 fit this pattern.  The damage, if any, is typically slower and more insidious.  The key question is *why* it's happening and what the *cumulative* effect is over 4 years.\n\n**Why is Mild Cerebral Hypoxia Happening? Potential Causes in Your Case**\n\nGiven your history, here are some potential contributing factors *that your doctors will be investigating*.  I'm listing them to give you a framework for understanding, not to self-diagnose:\n\n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):**  This is a condition where blood doesn't pool effectively when you stand up, leading to reduced blood flow to the brain.  The standing from sitting scenario you describe is extremely common for POTS sufferers.  The spasms and staring could be related to brief periods of reduced cerebral perfusion (blood flow).\n* **Diabetes & Microvascular Disease:** Type 1 diabetes, even well-managed, can lead to microvascular damage (damage to small blood vessels) over time.  This *could* affect blood flow to the brain.  Your December bloodwork being normal is good, but it's a snapshot; long-term effects can still be present.\n* **Cardiovascular Issues:** This is why the cardiology referral is important.  There could be underlying heart conditions (even if subtle) that affect blood flow regulation.  This could be rhythm disturbances, structural issues, or other factors.\n* **Cerebral Blood Flow Regulation:**  Some people have less efficient ways to regulate blood flow to the brain when changing positions or under stress (like focusing intensely on a screen). This is sometimes linked to autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\n* **Venous Outflow Obstruction**: Sometimes, the veins that drain blood from the brain can be compressed. This can lead to a build-up of pressure and reduced oxygen delivery.\n* **Migraine Variants**: Although you didn\u2019t mention headaches, atypical migraines can sometimes present with neurological symptoms like staring spells and even transient weakness.\n\n\n\n**Is Frequent Mild Cerebral Hypoxia Concerning?  Your Situation.**\n\nYes, the *frequency* of your episodes IS a matter of concern, *even if* the EEG didn't show epilepsy.  Here's why:\n\n* **Cumulative Effect:** While each episode might be mild, repeated episodes of even mild hypoxia can potentially lead to long-term subtle brain changes.  This is the biggest worry.  It's about the overall burden.\n* **Underlying Cause:** The fact that it's happening frequently suggests there's an underlying problem that *needs* to be identified and addressed. You don't want to just live with these episodes; you want to know *why* they're happening.\n* **Quality of Life:**  These episodes are impacting your daily life.  That's enough reason to pursue a diagnosis and treatment.\n* **Diabetes Link:** The interplay between your diabetes and potential cerebrovascular issues is concerning and warrants careful investigation.\n\n**What You Can Do While Waiting for Cardiology (and to Discuss with your Doctors)**\n\n1. **Detailed Episode Diary:**  Keep a very detailed log of your episodes. Include:\n   * **Time of day**\n   * **What you were doing *immediately* before (very specific \u2013 e.g., \"coding on computer, looking down at keyboard for 30 minutes\")**\n   * **How long you were sitting for**\n   * **What position you were in**\n   * **What exactly happened during the episode (be specific about the spasms - where, what kind of movement, how long did they last. Describe the staring - eyes fixed?  Unresponsive?)**\n   * **How long the episode lasted**\n   * **What, if anything, makes it better or worse.**\n   * **Any associated symptoms (dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, headache, vision changes, etc.)**\n2. **Hydration and Salt Intake:**  Especially if POTS is a possibility, adequate hydration and salt intake can help increase blood volume. *Talk to your doctor before significantly increasing salt intake*, especially with diabetes.\n3. **Compression Stockings:**  Again, if POTS is suspected, compression stockings can help blood return from the legs.\n4. **Gradual Positional Changes:** Avoid sudden movements when standing up. Rise slowly.\n5. **Break Up Prolonged Sitting:** Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes.  Even a short walk can help.\n6. **Discuss with your GP/Endocrinologist:**  Bring your detailed diary to your appointments.  Specifically ask:\n    * \"What is the most likely cause of these episodes, given my history of Type 1 Diabetes and the EEG results?\"\n    * \"What further tests are needed to rule out potential causes (like POTS, cardiovascular issues, or vascular problems)?\"\n    * \"What can I do *right now* to minimize the frequency and severity of these episodes while I'm waiting for cardiology?\"\n    * \"Is there any risk of long-term brain damage from these episodes, and what steps can we take to prevent that?\"\n7. **Cardiology Questions:** When you *finally* see cardiology, be prepared to discuss the detailed diary and the EEG results.  Specific questions to ask them:\n    * \"Could this be related to a heart condition affecting blood flow to the brain?\"\n    * \"What tests will you be doing to assess my cardiovascular function?\"\n    * \"What treatment options are available if a heart condition is identified?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Do not delay seeking medical attention based on information you find online.\n\n\n\nI understand this is a lot of information.  Advocate for yourself, be persistent, and keep communicating with your healthcare team.  The key is to find the underlying cause and take steps to protect your brain health.  Good luck."

Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues).

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex case with a lot of concerning symptoms and a frustrating history of being dismissed by medical professionals. It's understandable why you're feeling lost and seeking help.  You are *not* crazy, and your symptoms are definitely worth investigating thoroughly. Here's a breakdown of possibilities, what you need to push for, and how to approach things, categorized for clarity.  I will also preface this with a **disclaimer at the end:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* continue seeking medical attention.\n\n**I. Summarizing the Concerning Symptoms:**\n\n* **Neurological:**\n    * Severe headaches\n    * Facial/limb tingling & numbness\n    * Motor tics (sometimes painful)\n    * Convulsions (triggered by various stimuli, including flashing lights & substances, but also occurring sober) - *This is the most concerning symptom.*\n    * Loss of consciousness during convulsions\n    * Memory problems (short & long term)\n    * Weakness in limbs\n    * White matter changes on MRI (requires further investigation)\n    * Strange sensation in head preceding convulsions\n* **Systemic/General:**\n    * Chronic Fatigue (sleeping 12+ hours) - potentially linked to anemia\n    * Anemia (low folate, hematocrit, hemoglobin, Vitamin D, sodium) \u2013 *needs addressing!*\n    * Malnourishment (low folate, Vitamin D, sodium)\n    * High Albumin (could indicate inflammation or dehydration, sometimes seen in chronic illness)\n    * Gastrointestinal issues (nausea, stomach pain)\n    * Frequent UTIs\n* **Family History:** Significant history of mental health, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and polycystic kidney disease.  This dramatically increases the likelihood of a genetic or inherited component to your problems.\n\n\n\n**II. Potential Causes to Explore (What your doctors *should* be considering):**\n\nGiven the breadth of symptoms and the family history, here are some possibilities. These are not diagnoses, but areas to direct investigation:\n\n* **Epilepsy/Seizure Disorder:** Despite the normal EEG, this *cannot* be ruled out.  EEGs can miss seizures (especially non-generalized ones).  The triggers (flashing lights, substances) are highly suggestive.\n    * **Further Testing:**  **Prolonged EEG monitoring (days or weeks) is crucial.**  Ambulatory EEG or video-EEG monitoring (capturing activity during a typical day and when a seizure occurs) is ideal. Also, consider a **fMRI-EEG** which can pinpoint seizure foci more accurately than a standard EEG.\n* **Migraine with Aura (Complex Migraine):**  While you've been diagnosed with migraines, the atypical symptoms (tingling, numbness, convulsions) suggest it might be a more complex migraine variant.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a diagnosis of exclusion and is often made when there is neurological symptoms that aren't explained by structural issues. *However*, it shouldn't be a label slapped on you without exhausting *every* other possible explanation.\n* **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**  Inflammation of the brain, caused by the immune system attacking brain tissue.  Can cause a *very* wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.  It can be difficult to diagnose.\n    * **Further Testing:**  Autoantibody panels (looking for specific antibodies attacking the brain). Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) analysis is crucial.\n* **Genetic Conditions:** Given the family history, consider genetic testing for predispositions to neurological conditions, metabolic disorders, or inherited anemias.  The white matter changes on MRI could be indicative of a genetic leukodystrophy, for example.\n* **Mitochondrial Disease:**  Can cause fatigue, neurological symptoms, and gastrointestinal issues.\n* **Nutritional Deficiencies:** While you have low folate, Vitamin D, and sodium, the *cause* of these deficiencies needs to be investigated. Malabsorption issues (like in celiac disease or other GI problems) could be to blame.\n* **Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome:** Could explain some of the UTI issues.\n* **POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome):**  If fainting was a prominent early symptom, and you experience lightheadedness, this needs to be evaluated.\n* **Connective Tissue Disorders:** Some disorders like Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome can present with a wide array of neurological issues and GI problems.\n\n**III. Addressing Your Concerns & Getting Better Care:**\n\n* **Document EVERYTHING:** Keep a detailed symptom diary.  Note the time, nature of the symptom, potential triggers (food, light, stress, substances), and duration.  This will be invaluable.\n* **Find a Neurologist Who Listens:** This is *critical*.  You need a neurologist who is willing to consider complex cases and doesn't dismiss your symptoms.  Look for one specializing in epilepsy, movement disorders, or neuroimmunology.  Don't be afraid to get a second or third opinion. Go to a teaching hospital if possible.\n* **Be Assertive:**  Clearly and calmly explain your history, emphasizing the debilitating nature of your symptoms and the impact on your life.  Bring your symptom diary.\n* **Specifically Request Testing:**  Don't wait for the doctor to suggest tests.  Based on the possibilities above, *request* the specific tests you feel are necessary (prolonged EEG, autoantibody panel, MRI with contrast, genetic testing, metabolic workup, CSF analysis, GI workup).\n* **Bring a Support Person:**  Having someone with you can help you remember details, advocate for you, and provide emotional support.\n* **Consider a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** A full blood workup to assess organ function and electrolyte levels.

        "question": "Hi all, I don\u2019t know if Im looking in the right place but wanted to get some advice I have these \u201cfits\u201d where for about 10 seconds I can\u2019t control my left side of my body or speak, it usually cause my arm to go up in the air, and my face to scrunch up, I am fully conscious and aware of what is happening during these episodes but I can\u2019t control them, I am able to tell when I am about to have one, they normally happen when I stand up to fast, and jumped unexpectedly, or when I\u2019m very nervous, I have had an EEG and an MRI scan about 4 years ago nothing showed up and no epilepsy was diagnosed either. I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly distressing and frustrating, and it's good you're actively seeking answers. It's *very* reasonable to want a diagnosis and some way to manage these episodes. Here's a breakdown of things to consider, what might be going on, and how to proceed. **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses.**\n\n**Understanding What You're Describing**\n\nWhat you're describing sounds like it *could* be a few different things, and the fact that previous tests were normal complicates things, but doesn't mean there isn't an explanation.  Here's a breakdown of possibilities based on your description:\n\n* **Focal Seizures (Even with a Normal EEG):** While your EEG was normal 4 years ago, that doesn\u2019t *completely* rule out epilepsy.\n    *   **Focal Aware Seizures:** These happen when only one part of the brain is affected, and you remain conscious. They can manifest in different ways \u2013 movement, sensations, emotions, or even just a strange feeling. The raising of your arm and facial scrunching are consistent with this.  Sometimes focal seizures don't show up clearly on a standard EEG, especially if they are infrequent or happening at the time of the test.\n    *   **EEG Limitations:**  EEGs only record brain activity *during* the test. If your episodes aren't happening *during* the EEG, it won't detect them. Also, some seizure types are more difficult to capture on EEG.\n* **Paroxysmal Dyskinesias:** These are sudden, involuntary movements.  There are different types. Some are genetic, others are acquired. They can be triggered by things like sudden movements, stress, or even caffeine.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  This is a condition where there's a problem with how the brain sends and receives signals to the body.  It\u2019s *not* psychological in the sense of \"made up\" \u2013 it's a real neurological problem, but the issue isn't damage to the brain itself, but how it functions. Stress and sudden movements can definitely trigger FND symptoms. (Sometimes previously called \"conversion disorder,\" but FND is the preferred term).\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines can present with unusual neurological symptoms *before* the headache, including weakness or paralysis on one side of the body.\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) - Even Less Likely Given Age & History:** Although less likely given your history and lack of risk factors (which you haven't provided), a TIA (mini-stroke) can sometimes present with temporary weakness. However, the triggering factors (standing up fast, being startled) make this less likely.\n* **Vasovagal Syncope with Unusual Presentation:**  While typically leading to fainting, vasovagal syncope (a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure) can sometimes cause brief neurological symptoms like confusion or weakness *before* a full faint.\n\n\n\n**What to Do Next:  Pushing for Further Investigation**\n\nYou're right to be frustrated and to want more answers. Here\u2019s a plan of action:\n\n1. **Detailed Episode Diary:**  This is *crucial*. For at least 2-4 weeks, meticulously record *every* episode.  Include:\n    *   **Date and Time:**\n    *   **Precise Description:**  What *exactly* happens?  Which muscles are affected?  How long does it last? (you've already described this well, keep that detail).\n    *   **Triggers:**  What were you doing *immediately* before it happened (standing, startled, nervous about something specific)?  What was your emotional state?\n    *   **What happens *after*?:** Are you tired? Confused? Any lingering weakness?\n    *   **Any aura or warning signs**: you mention being able to tell when its coming, what does that feel like?\n2. **Return to Your Doctor (or Seek a Second Opinion):** \n    *   **Bring the Episode Diary:**  This is your most powerful tool.\n    *   **Specifically Request a Neurology Referral:**  You need to see a neurologist, preferably one who specializes in movement disorders or epilepsy, *even though* your previous tests were normal.  Explain the persistence of your symptoms and the impact on your life.\n    *   **Discuss Video EEG:**  Specifically ask about the possibility of a prolonged video EEG. This monitors your brain activity *while* being video-recorded.  This allows the neurologist to see what's happening simultaneously with the brain activity, making it more likely to catch an event. The key thing is to try and *reproduce* a trigger during the video-EEG to try and get an event to happen during the monitoring.\n    *   **Further Imaging:**  Discuss a repeat MRI, potentially with specific protocols for epilepsy or movement disorders.  Technology has advanced in 4 years.\n    * **Consider mentioning FND:** Although diagnosis is complex, bringing it up could open a discussion around a different possibility.\n\n3. **Specialist Considerations:**\n    *   **Neurologist specializing in Epilepsy:** If seizures are suspected.\n    *   **Neurologist specializing in Movement Disorders:** If paroxysmal dyskinesia is a possibility.\n    * **Neuropsychologist:** If FND is suspected, a neuropsychological evaluation can be helpful.\n\n4. **Be Your Own Advocate:** You know your body best. Don't let your concerns be dismissed. If you feel you're not being taken seriously, *seek a second opinion*.\n\n\n\n**Important Things to Remember:**\n\n*   **This is Not Your Fault:**  Whatever is causing this, it's not something you're doing wrong.\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:**  It's easy to fall down internet rabbit holes. Let the doctors do their job.\n*   **Stay Positive (As Much as Possible):**  Finding a diagnosis can take time and persistence.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

For instance \"lf you have X specific kind of epilepsy, or if you aren't taking X medication you can take them\" Does the dose matter? I have read people say that would have seizures when microdosing but not when doing high doses. How does that work? Thank you so much!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex question, and I'm glad you're asking it.  You're rightly being cautious, given your history of chemotherapy-induced epilepsy and current cancer-free status.  I'm going to break down the information as thoroughly as possible, but **please read the VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER at the end.**  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  This is for informational purposes only.\n\n**Understanding the Risks: Psychedelics and Epilepsy**\n\nPsychedelics (like psilocybin \u2013 the active compound in magic mushrooms, LSD, DMT, etc.) *can* lower the seizure threshold, meaning they make it easier for seizures to occur. This is the primary reason for concern for anyone with epilepsy.  The mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to involve effects on neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, glutamate, GABA) which are vital in seizure control.\n\nHowever, the relationship isn't straightforward. It's not a guaranteed seizure trigger for *everyone* with epilepsy.  The risk level depends on many factors, including:\n\n* **Type of Epilepsy:** This is *critical*.\n* **Seizure Control:** How well controlled your seizures currently are.\n* **Medication:** The specific anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) you are taking.\n* **Individual Brain Sensitivity:**  People respond differently.\n* **Dosage:** Absolutely a factor, as you've correctly noted.\n* **Set & Setting:**  (Environment, mindset, support)  This is important for all psychedelic use, but *especially* crucial for those with a health vulnerability.\n* **Substance:** Different psychedelics have different profiles; some may be riskier than others.\n\n\n\n**Specific Considerations for Chemotherapy-Induced Epilepsy**\n\nThis adds another layer of complexity. Chemotherapy can cause lasting changes in the brain.  The type of chemo you received and the specific areas of the brain affected are relevant.\n\n* **Structural Brain Changes:** Some chemo drugs can cause damage to brain tissue, potentially creating focal areas of irritation that could be triggered.\n* **Cognitive Effects:** Chemo can have long-term cognitive effects. Psychedelics can sometimes exacerbate cognitive difficulties.\n* **Long-Term Epilepsy:**  Chemo-induced epilepsy can sometimes be difficult to manage, and your seizure threshold may be lower than someone with idiopathic epilepsy (epilepsy with no clear cause).\n\n\n\n**Variations That *Might* Affect Risk (But Still Require Medical Consultation)**\n\nYou're asking about situations where the risk *might* be lower. This is where it gets very nuanced.  **I'm listing these as possibilities to discuss with your doctor, *not* as a green light to proceed without professional guidance.**\n\n1. **Well-Controlled Epilepsy:**  If your epilepsy is **extremely well-controlled** on medication for a significant period (several years), with *no* breakthrough seizures, some doctors might consider the risk slightly lower.  However, \"well-controlled\" is a strict definition.\n2. **Specific Epilepsy Syndromes:**\n    * **Absence Epilepsy:** Some (very limited) anecdotal evidence suggests that some people with absence epilepsy might tolerate very low doses of certain psychedelics without triggering seizures. *However*, this is highly speculative and *extremely* risky.  It's not recommended to experiment with this.\n    * **Jactating Epilepsy**: This condition is specifically sensitive and would not be recommend.\n    * **Focal Epilepsy (with specific characteristics):** This is where it becomes very complex. If your focal epilepsy arises from a specific, well-defined area of the brain *not* involved in seizure generation, a doctor *might* (again, a big might) consider the risk profile differently.  Good imaging (MRI) is essential.\n3. **Medication Interactions:**  Certain AEDs *might* interact with psychedelics in ways that could influence the risk (either increasing or decreasing it). This is something a physician specializing in both neurology and psychopharmacology would need to evaluate.  **Do NOT stop or change your AEDs without your doctor's explicit instructions.**\n4. **Microdosing vs. Larger Doses (The Paradoxical Effect):** This is the interesting point you raised. The reported phenomenon of seizures at microdoses but not higher doses is not fully understood and isn't universally observed.  Here are some theories:\n    * **Subtle Neurochemical Shifts:** Microdoses may cause subtle shifts in neurotransmitter levels that, paradoxically, *disrupt* the delicate balance maintained by AEDs.  They may hit a \"sweet spot\" of instability.\n    * **AED Mechanism:** Some AEDs work by stabilizing neuronal membranes. A very low dose of a psychedelic might be enough to momentarily disrupt that stabilization without triggering a full-blown seizure. A higher dose might have a more global and saturating effect that doesn't destabilize the membranes as much (this is a simplification).\n    * **Individual Variability:** The brain's response to psychedelics is highly individual.\n    *  **Placebo effect:** Some reported microdosing side effects could be caused by the placebo effect.\n\n\n\n**Dosage Matters Immensely**\n\n* **Higher doses = Generally higher risk:** This is the safest assumption.  The more psychedelic substance, the greater the potential to lower the seizure threshold.\n* **Microdosing:**  As discussed above, the risk isn't necessarily linearly related to dose. Microdosing can be unpredictable.  It's especially dangerous to assume that because a very small dose doesn't cause a noticeable effect, it's \"safe.\"\n* **Titration (Never do this on your own!):**  *If* a doctor were to consider any psychedelic use, it would likely involve an extremely slow and carefully monitored titration (gradual increase in dose) in a controlled clinical setting.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n* **Psychological Impact:** Psychedelics can be emotionally and psychologically intense.  This could be destabilizing, especially for someone with a history of cancer and a potentially vulnerable nervous system.\n* **Legality:**  Most psychedelics are illegal in many jurisdictions.  This creates additional risks (quality control, legal consequences).\n* **Research is Limited:** There is very little research on the effects of psychedelics in people with epilepsy, especially chemotherapy-induced epilepsy.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. **Neurologist Consultation (Essential):**  Talk to your neurologist *first* and *be completely honest about your interest in psychedelics*.  A neurologist specializing in epilepsy is ideal.\n2. **Psychiatrist/Psychopharmacologist Consultation (Highly Recommended):**  A psychiatrist with expertise in psychopharmacology can assess potential drug interactions and psychological risks.\n3. **Realistic Expectations:**  The chances of a doctor approving psychedelic use, given your history, are low.  Weigh the potential benefits against the very real and serious risks.\n4. **If Approved (Highly Unlikely):**\n    * **Controlled Setting:** Only consider use in a strictly controlled medical setting with continuous EEG monitoring.\n    * **Start Extremely Low:** If a trial is attempted, it would begin with a dose far below the typical recreational dose.\n    * **Substance Purity:** Ensure the substance is analytically tested for purity and dosage.\n    * **Support:** Have a trusted and experienced trip sitter present who is aware of your medical history.\n\n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. The information provided above is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  The use of psychedelics carries inherent risks, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions like epilepsy.  I strongly advise against using psychedelics without the express guidance and supervision of a medical professional. You are responsible for your own health and safety.\n\n\n\nDo you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to elaborate on any specific point?

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack, and you're understandably stressed. It's good you're recognizing these patterns and seeking information. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, what you should consider, and how to navigate things, keeping your epilepsy and financial concerns in mind.  I will also add a **disclaimer at the end** as I am not a medical professional.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n* **Epilepsy and Cognitive Function:**  You're right to consider the epilepsy.  While not everyone with epilepsy experiences cognitive issues, it *can* affect attention, memory, and executive function (planning, organization, time management \u2013 all things that sound familiar to your struggles). The type of epilepsy, seizure control (which Lamotrigine is helping with, hopefully), and even the medication itself can play a role. Importantly, even *subclinical* (undetectable) seizures can sometimes impact cognitive function.\n* **ADHD Possibility:** Your description *does* sound like it aligns with ADHD symptoms, especially the procrastination, difficulty focusing, getting fixated, and feeling overwhelmed.  The fact that these symptoms only *relatively recently* emerged (after 18) is a bit less typical, but not disqualifying. ADHD can sometimes present later in life, or be 'unmasked' by stress (like starting university).\n* **Lamotrigine & Cognition:** Lamotrigine is generally considered less cognitively impairing than some other anti-epileptic drugs, but it *can* have side effects that affect concentration and thinking for some people. It's something to consider.\n* **Stress & University Pressure:** The pressure of the university offer is *significantly* exacerbating everything. Anxiety thrives on perceived high stakes. The cycle of procrastination, panic, and last-minute work is incredibly draining.\n* **Counselor's Advice:** Your counselor is acting responsibly by suggesting a medical evaluation. She's acknowledging the potential connection to your epilepsy, but wisely acknowledging she can't diagnose.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do, Step-by-Step**\n\n1. **Talk to Your Neurologist (First & Most Important):** This needs to be your *first* step. Schedule an appointment. Tell them *specifically* about these attention and procrastination issues, and that you suspect they might be related to your epilepsy or medication.  \n    *   **Specifically ask:**\n        *   Could my epilepsy, even with medication, be contributing to these cognitive difficulties?\n        *   Could Lamotrigine be playing a role, and is there any room to adjust the dosage (don't change anything yourself!).\n        *   Would they recommend a neuropsychological evaluation (see #3 below)? (More on this next).\n    *   **Preparation:**  Keep a detailed log for a week or two before your appointment. Note:\n        *   When you experience difficulty focusing.\n        *   What you were trying to do.\n        *   What distracted you.\n        *   How you felt emotionally (stressed, frustrated, etc.).\n        *   Any patterns you notice.\n\n2. **Investigate Lower-Cost Evaluation Options:**  The cost of a full ADHD/neuropsychological evaluation *can* be high.  Here's how to explore affordable options:\n    *   **University Health Services:** Many universities have psychological evaluation services, often at a reduced cost for students. *This is a good starting point because they're familiar with the student experience and often have connections to specialists.*\n    *   **Teaching Hospitals:** Hospitals associated with medical schools often offer evaluations conducted by trainees under the supervision of experienced professionals. This can significantly lower the cost.\n    *   **Sliding Scale Clinics:**  Look for mental health clinics in your area that offer a sliding scale fee structure (fees adjusted based on income).\n    *   **Insurance (if applicable):**  Check your (or your parents\u2019) health insurance coverage for neuropsychological testing. Even partial coverage can help.\n    *  **Online Evaluation:** While less ideal, some online services offer ADHD screenings. These are *not* a substitute for a full evaluation but can provide initial indicators and may be cheaper.\n\n3. **Neuropsychological Evaluation:** If a medical professional (neurologist or psychiatrist) agrees it\u2019s warranted, a neuropsychological evaluation is the gold standard for diagnosing ADHD and differentiating it from other possible causes of your symptoms. It's a comprehensive assessment of your cognitive strengths and weaknesses.  It\u2019s detailed and can pinpoint exactly where the difficulties lie. *It's especially important in your case, because of the epilepsy*.\n\n4. **Address the Immediate Pressure (University):**\n    *   **Contact the University:**  Reach out to the admissions office or a student advisor at the university. Explain (briefly, and professionally) that you're experiencing some challenges affecting your academic performance, and you're actively seeking help. They may be willing to be understanding, especially if you have a documented medical issue (like epilepsy). *Don't reveal everything right away, just focus on the fact that you're taking steps to address it.*\n    *  **Break Down Tasks:**  Instead of thinking about giant assignments, break them into *extremely* small, manageable steps.  (E.g., instead of \"Write essay,\" think \"Brainstorm three topic ideas,\" then \"Write the introductory sentence,\" etc.).\n    *   **Time Blocking:**  Schedule specific blocks of time for dedicated work. Even 25-minute blocks with 5-minute breaks (Pomodoro Technique) can be helpful.\n    *  **Minimize Distractions:** This is hard, but essential. Turn off your phone, find a quiet study space, and use website blockers if necessary.\n    * **Prioritize Sleep:**  Lack of sleep drastically worsens attention and procrastination.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n* **Self-Diagnosis is Risky:** Don't self-diagnose.  It's easy to fall down rabbit holes online.  A professional diagnosis is essential, particularly given your epilepsy.\n* **Comorbidity:**  It's common for ADHD to occur alongside other conditions, including anxiety and depression.  A thorough evaluation can identify any co-occurring issues.\n* **Treatment Options:** If you *are* diagnosed with ADHD, there are many treatment options available:  medication, therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy is often very effective), and lifestyle changes.\n\n**Regarding Cost:**\n\nYou\u2019re right to be concerned. Be upfront about your financial limitations with any healthcare provider. They may have suggestions for lower-cost services or be able to work with you on a payment plan.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  This is *especially* important given your medical history of epilepsy and the potential interactions between medications.\n\n\n\n**To help me tailor my advice further, could you tell me:**\n\n*   What type of epilepsy do you have (if you know)?\n*   How well controlled are your seizures?\n*   Do you have health insurance?\n*   Are you comfortable sharing the name of your university (so I can potentially look up their resources)?\n\n\n\n\nYou're taking the right steps by recognizing the problem and actively seeking solutions.  It's a challenging situation, but you're capable of addressing it.  Good luck \u2013 and please prioritize your health!"

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that's a *lot* to unpack, and honestly, you've been through a truly rough time. It's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge all of this and actively want to improve things, especially with the history of negative medical experiences. You're absolutely right to prioritize your physical health, given everything you're navigating.  It's also smart you're addressing *why* you avoid medical care in therapy \u2013 that's crucial.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how to find a good PCP, what to focus on for getting on track, and some additional thoughts.  This is long, but I'll try to be comprehensive.\n\n**1. Finding a PCP Comfortable with Mental Health**\n\nThis is the biggest hurdle, and your experiences make it understandable why you're hesitant. Here's how to boost your chances of success:\n\n*   **Psychiatrist/Therapist Recommendations:** *This is your BEST starting point.* Ask your current psychiatrist and therapist directly for recommendations. They likely have colleagues they trust and know are sensitive to complex mental health presentations.  Specifically ask them *why* they recommend someone - \"Do they have experience with patients on mood stabilizers?\" or \"Are they generally understanding of the impact mental health has on physical health?\".\n*   **Psychology Today Directory:** This website (psychologytoday.com) allows you to search for doctors and filter by specialties, including \"Family Medicine\" or \"Internal Medicine.\"  More importantly, *many* doctors include a brief bio. Look for language that indicates comfort with mental health (e.g., \"holistic care,\" \"collaborative approach,\" \"experience with complex medical histories,\" mention of treating anxiety/depression in addition to physical conditions).\n*   **Openly Call Practices:**  Don't feel bad about proactively calling practices and asking.  A script might be: \"Hi, I'm looking for a primary care physician. I have a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety, managed with medication, and I'm looking for a doctor who is comfortable working with patients who have mental health conditions.  Would you be able to tell me if any of your doctors have experience with that?\"  Be prepared for some \"no's\" \u2013 don't take it personally. This is a screening process.\n* **Look for Patient-Centered Medical Homes:** These practices emphasize a collaborative relationship between patient and provider.\n*   **Consider Academic Medical Centers:** Doctors affiliated with universities and teaching hospitals are often more open to complexity and staying up-to-date on best practices.\n* **Online Reviews:** While not foolproof, read reviews. Look for comments that mention a doctor\u2019s bedside manner, willingness to listen, and ability to handle complex cases.\n\n**Important Considerations when \"Interviewing\" a PCP:**\n\n*   **First Appointment as an \"Interview\":**  It\u2019s okay to schedule an initial appointment *specifically* to see if it's a good fit.  Say upfront, \"I'm looking for a long-term PCP and want to make sure we're a good match.\"\n*   **Ask Direct Questions:**  Don't be afraid to ask:\n    *   \"How do you approach patients with a history of mental health conditions?\"\n    *   \"How do you coordinate care with specialists (like my psychiatrist and therapist)?\"\n    *   \"What are your thoughts on the interplay between physical and mental health?\"\n    *   \"What is your policy on prescription refills for medications like Lamictal and Fluoxetine?\" (ensure they're comfortable continuing or coordinating refills).\n* **Trust Your Gut:**  If you feel dismissed, rushed, or judged, *move on*.  You deserve a doctor who makes you feel safe and heard.\n\n\n\n**2. Getting On Track \u2013 Medical Checklist**\n\nYou\u2019re already doing the hardest part - recognizing the need for this! Here's a breakdown of what to prioritize for a physical health check-up:\n\n*   **Comprehensive Physical Exam:** This is a basic starting point. Blood pressure, heart rate, lung sounds, etc.\n*   **Bloodwork:**\n    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Checks for overall health, anemia, infection.\n    *   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** Checks kidney and liver function, electrolytes, blood sugar. Very important given meds like Lamictal and Fluoxetine.\n    *   **Lipid Panel:** Cholesterol levels.\n    *   **Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** Thyroid function.  Thyroid issues can mimic or exacerbate mental health symptoms.\n    *   **Vitamin D Level:** You're already supplementing, but important to monitor.\n    *   **A1C:**  Checks average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months, screening for diabetes.\n    *   **CBC with differential:** rules out infection\n*   **Cardiovascular Assessment:**  Given your history and medication, a basic EKG might be a good idea, and discussion of any family history of heart disease.\n*   **Abdominal Epilepsy Management:**  *This is critical.* It needs to be managed by a neurologist and likely monitored regularly.  Your PCP needs to be aware of this diagnosis and how it's being treated.\n*   **Medication Review:**  Bring a *complete* list of *everything* you take, including dosages and frequency.  Discuss potential side effects and interactions.  *Especially* important with Lamictal, Fluoxetine, and Gabapentin.\n*   **Vaccinations:**  Make sure you're up-to-date on routine vaccinations (flu, tetanus, pneumonia, COVID).\n* **Screening appropriate to age/sex:** Colon cancer, prostate cancer, etc.\n\n**3.

Let your PCP know you have a history of trauma and that you may have difficulty with certain aspects of the medical exam (e.g., physical touch).  A good doctor will be respectful of your boundaries.\n*   **Suicidal Ideation:**  Be honest with your PCP.  They need to know you're high-risk. This doesn't mean they'll abandon you, but it allows them to be more vigilant and connect you with resources if needed. They should be asking you about this routinely anyway.\n*   **Substance Use:** Be honest about your tobacco and marijuana use.  This will impact their recommendations and potential drug interactions.\n* **Explain your prior bad experiences:** Explain your difficulties and concerns up front so they are aware.\n\n**4.

Finding the right PCP may take time and effort. Don't give up. You deserve compassionate, competent care.  The fact that you are actively working on this demonstrates incredible strength and commitment to your well-being.  You're doing this for yourself, your wife, and your parents \u2013 that\u2019s a powerful motivator.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My bf is a 33M, 220 lbs, history of epilepsy, high cholesterol, has high blood pressure on occasion, ADD, allergy to augmentin, and kiwi. He takes lamotrigine, phenobarbital, Lamictal. He vapes, never drinks, and smokes marijuana on occasion. He hasn't had a seizure in three years fortunately. He went to the Dr yesterday and his Dr told him his med levels are at a level 2 when they should be at around a 7. Dr showed him that the levels dropped to dangerous levels in three years despite an increase in meds in those years. Any insight in what this could be? He's waiting on more blood tests.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a concerning situation, and it's good he's getting further investigation with more blood tests. A decreasing medication level despite *increasing* dosage is a significant red flag. Here's a breakdown of possible insights, categorized for clarity, along with explanations tailored to your boyfriend's history.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Problem: Subtherapeutic Drug Levels**\n\nHis anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) \u2013 lamotrigine and phenobarbital (Lamictal is a brand name for lamotrigine) \u2013 need to be within a specific therapeutic range in the blood to effectively control seizures. A level of 2 when aiming for a 7 indicates a substantial drop, meaning the medication isn't being absorbed, processed, or maintained in his system as expected.  The fact this happened *despite* dosage increases makes it even more worrisome.  While he's been seizure-free for 3 years, that doesn't negate the importance of maintaining therapeutic levels; it can be a precarious balance.\n\n\n\n**Potential Causes (What could be happening?)**\n\nThis is where it gets complex. Here's a breakdown of possibilities, categorized by likelihood and influence, with specific consideration for his medical profile:\n\n**1. Medication Interference - *High Probability***\n\n*   **Drug Interactions:** This is a PRIMARY concern given his vaping and occasional marijuana use. Both nicotine (vaping) and cannabinoids (marijuana) can have significant effects on liver enzymes (specifically cytochrome P450 enzymes) that metabolize AEDs like phenobarbital and lamotrigine.\n    *   **Nicotine:** Nicotine *induces* certain enzymes, meaning it can speed up how the body breaks down these medications, lowering blood levels. This is a very plausible explanation for decreasing levels despite increased dosage. Even inconsistent vaping can impact this.\n    *   **Marijuana (Cannabinoids):**  Cannabinoids are more complex.  They can *inhibit* some enzymes and *induce* others. The net effect is unpredictable and can vary depending on the strain, frequency of use, and his individual metabolism. However, they absolutely *can* impact AED levels.\n*   **Other Medications/Supplements:** Is he taking *anything* else, even over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?  These can interact too.\n\n**2. Absorption Issues - *Moderate Probability***\n\n*   **Gastrointestinal Issues:** Problems with absorption in the stomach or intestines can prevent the medication from getting into the bloodstream. This could be due to:\n    *   **Gut Health:**  Changes to gut flora (from diet, stress, etc.).\n    *   **Malabsorption:**  Less likely without other digestive symptoms, but possible.\n*   **Adherence:**  Although it's sensitive to ask, it's worth considering if he's consistently taking his medication as prescribed.  This isn't a judgment, but unintentional missed doses can happen.\n\n**3. Metabolism Changes - *Moderate Probability***\n\n*   **Liver Function:**  Both phenobarbital and lamotrigine are processed by the liver.  Changes in liver function (even subtle ones) can affect how quickly these drugs are cleared from the body. Since he has high cholesterol and occasional high blood pressure, it's important to evaluate liver health. *This will likely be part of the further blood tests.*\n*   **Enzyme Induction/Changes:**  Beyond vaping/marijuana, other factors can induce liver enzymes, leading to faster metabolism.  Even age (though 33 is relatively young) can have a small effect.\n\n**4. Physiological Changes - *Lower Probability, but needs consideration***\n\n*   **Weight Changes:** He hasn't mentioned weight changes, but significant weight loss or gain can potentially alter drug distribution and metabolism.\n*   **Hydration Status:** Dehydration can sometimes affect drug levels.\n*   **Kidney Function:**  While less directly involved with these specific AEDs, kidney issues can indirectly impact medication levels.\n\n**5.  Less Common, But Possible**\n\n*   **Genetic Factors:**  Variations in genes that code for drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect how someone processes medication.  (Pharmacogenomics). A test could potentially identify this.\n* **Autoimmune response** \u2013 a rare possibility, but worth considering if other causes are ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n**Why the Drop Over Time is Concerning**\n\nThe fact that the levels dropped *over three years* despite increasing the medication is particularly troubling. This suggests a gradual change in one or more of the factors above.  It's not a sudden event, but a developing issue.\n\n**What the Additional Blood Tests Might Include**\n\nHis doctor is right to order further tests. Expect them to check:\n\n*   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To assess liver health. ALT, AST, bilirubin, and albumin are common tests.\n*   **Kidney Function Tests:**  Creatinine, BUN.\n*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To look for general health issues.\n*   **Electrolytes:** Sodium, potassium, etc., to rule out imbalances\n*   **Drug Levels (Recheck):**  Repeat the lamotrigine and phenobarbital levels to confirm the initial results.\n* **Thyroid Function** \u2013 thyroid issues can sometimes affect drug metabolism.\n* **Vitamin D levels** \u2013 deficiency can sometimes impact neurological health.\n\n\n\n\n**What He Needs to Discuss with His Doctor (Crucial)**\n\n*   **Full Disclosure:**  He *must* be completely honest about his vaping habits (frequency, type of device, e-liquid used) and marijuana use (frequency, method, strain if possible).  Don\u2019t minimize anything. This is essential for accurate diagnosis.\n*   **Medication List:** Provide a complete list of *everything* he takes, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements.\n*   **Diet and Lifestyle:**  Discuss any significant changes in his diet, exercise, or stress levels.\n*   **Symptoms:** Has he noticed any subtle changes in his mood, energy levels, or cognitive function? (These could be related to subtherapeutic drug levels).\n* **Potential Interaction Checker:** Ask the doctor to run a drug interaction check, explicitly including his vaping and marijuana use.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Only a doctor can properly diagnose the cause of the low medication levels and recommend the appropriate course of action.  Do not change his medication regimen without his doctor's guidance.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed explanation is helpful.  It sounds like you're a very supportive partner, and advocating for his health is wise.  Encourage him to be open and honest with his doctor, and to follow up with all recommended tests and appointments."

        "question": "Age: 21 Sex: Female (But I go by He/Him) Height: 5'3 Weight: 106lbsOver the past few months I've been seeing a psychiatrist and she's put me on numerous pills. The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been. And every now and then I'm seeing things like a weird grey cloud with a face in my bedroom or I'll think my hands are turning grey when they aren't.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *lot* going on, and it's incredibly concerning that you're not feeling heard by your psychiatrist. It's good you're reaching out, even if just to write it all down. Here's a breakdown of what I'm hearing, why it's concerning, and what you should do.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Here's a summary of your situation:**\n\n* **Medication Cocktail:** You're on a complex regimen: Wellbutrin, Venlafaxine (being weaned off), Hydroxyzine, Ondansetron, *and* now Oxcarbazepine. This is a significant number of medications, and interactions are possible.\n* **Severe Reaction to Cannabis:** Your experience with cannabis sounds like a very intense panic reaction, potentially bordering on a temporary psychosis.  The physical symptoms (shaking, muscle rigidity, forced breathing) and the hallucinations (air bubble, impending doom) are highly alarming.\n* **Worsening Suicidality:**  This is the *most* urgent concern. Your suicidal thoughts are *increased* since the cannabis experience and despite medication adjustments.\n* **New Physical Symptoms:**  You're experiencing widespread muscle/joint pain, fatigue, and a sensation of being bruised \u2013 all new since the cannabis experience. This is not typical post-panic attack and needs investigation.\n* **Visual Disturbances:**  The grey cloud/face and the perception of your hands changing color are visual disturbances - potentially hallucinations or illusions - that are very worrisome.\n* **Lack of Support from Psychiatrist:** You feel your psychiatrist isn't taking your concerns seriously, which is detrimental to your care.\n\n\n\n**Let's break down why each component is concerning:**\n\n* **Multiple Medications:** While combination therapy can be effective, the number of drugs you are on significantly increases the risk of side effects and drug interactions. Polypharmacy should be approached cautiously.\n* **Cannabis Interaction:** Even a \u2018small\u2019 amount of cannabis can have unpredictable effects when combined with psychiatric medications. The drugs you're on can *significantly* alter the way cannabis affects your brain.  It's good you haven't used it since, but the aftermath is clearly impacting you.\n* **Increased Suicidality:**  *This is the critical red flag.*  Any increase in suicidal thoughts, *especially* after a distressing event and medication changes, needs immediate attention.\n* **Physical Symptoms:** The generalized pain and fatigue are *not* typical anxiety symptoms. They could be a side effect of the medications, a response to the trauma of the cannabis experience, or indicate an underlying medical condition (which requires further investigation).\n* **Visual Disturbances:**  These, combined with the history of hallucinations during the cannabis experience, raise concerns about the potential for a psychotic disorder or medication-induced psychosis or hallucinations. Although this is not a diagnosis, it is absolutely important to get this checked out\n* **Psychiatrist Responsiveness:**  A good psychiatrist will thoroughly investigate new or worsening symptoms, *especially* suicidality and unusual physical complaints. Feeling dismissed is unacceptable.\n\n\n\n**Here are the steps you MUST take:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE SAFETY:** If you are actively feeling suicidal, **go to the nearest emergency room** or **call a crisis hotline.**  Do not wait for an appointment.  Here are some resources:\n   * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada.  In the UK, call 111.\n   * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741\n   * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)\n\n2. **Seek a Second Opinion (Very Important):**  You *need* to see a different psychiatrist.  Explain your entire history \u2013 the cannabis reaction, the worsening suicidality, the new physical symptoms, the visual disturbances, and your dissatisfaction with your current psychiatrist's response.  A fresh perspective is crucial.\n    * **Don't be afraid to be assertive.** Tell the new psychiatrist *exactly* how you're feeling and what you expect from them.\n\n3. **Medical Check-Up:** See your primary care physician (PCP) *as soon as possible*.  Explain the new pain and fatigue.  They can rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms.  Bring a list of *all* your medications with you.\n\n4. **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed journal of your symptoms, including:\n    * **Dates and times** when you experience symptoms\n    * **Specifics of the symptoms** (e.g., what kind of pain, where, how intense)\n    * **Any potential triggers** (stress, food, activity)\n    * **Your mood and suicidal thoughts**, and their intensity\n    * **Any conversations with your psychiatrist** (date, what you discussed, what their response was)\n\n5. **Medication Review:**  The new psychiatrist will need to carefully review all your medications.  The Oxcarbazepine is an anti-seizure medication, and while sometimes used for mood stabilization, it\u2019s important to understand why it was added and what the expected benefit is, *especially* given your worsening symptoms. You're also coming off Venlafaxine \u2013 that needs careful management.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding Cannabis:**  You've already learned a very valuable lesson.  Given your anxiety and the way your brain reacts to substances, it's best to avoid cannabis altogether. Your experience demonstrated a significant negative interaction with your medication.\n\n**Regarding Alcohol:** While alcohol hasn\u2019t caused an immediate adverse reaction, it's important to be *extremely* cautious when taking multiple psychiatric medications. Alcohol can interact with these drugs and worsen side effects or reduce their effectiveness. It's best to discuss alcohol use with your new psychiatrist.\n\n**Important Reminder:**  You deserve to be taken seriously and to receive effective care.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself.  \n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're very smart to be gathering information *before* your doctor's appointment and acknowledging you're likely overthinking (a very common and often helpful thing to do!). You've described a fascinating and complex collection of symptoms, and you're right to be inquisitive, especially given the family history. Here's a breakdown of thoughts, keeping in mind *I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice*. This is a discussion of possibilities to help you formulate questions for your physician.\n\n**Why Your Concerns Are Valid and Why Exploring Epilepsy is Sensible**\n\n* **Temporal Lobe Focus:** You've hit on something important by noticing the overlap between your experiences and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). TLE is known for very diverse presentations, and frequently manifests in non-convulsive seizures. Many people with TLE *don't* have dramatic, falling-down seizures. They have these more subtle, subjective experiences.\n* **Aura-Like Symptoms:** The fleeting tastes/smells and bursts of euphoria absolutely fit within the spectrum of simple partial (focal aware) seizures that can originate in the temporal lobe.  The enjoyment aspect isn't unusual; auras aren't always negative.\n* **Sleep Related Symptoms:** This is a *huge* point.  Seizures, and especially TLE, can be significantly exacerbated by sleep deprivation and can manifest *during* sleep or the transition into/out of sleep.  The descriptions of your semi-conscious states, buzzing sensations, and sleep paralysis-like events with head movement are concerning.  The amnesia afterwards is also a red flag.\n* **Family History:** A family history of epilepsy increases your risk. It doesn't *guarantee* you have it, but it heightens the possibility and makes investigation worthwhile.\n\n\n\n**Breaking Down Your Symptoms & Considerations**\n\nLet's look at each of your concerns:\n\n* **Tastes/Smells & Euphoria:**  Classic examples of simple partial seizures. It's good you note their brevity.\n* **Dissociation:**  Dissociation can happen on its own, but frequent, unexplained dissociation can also be a symptom of seizure activity.\n* **\"Semi-Conscious\" Napping Experiences:**  This is the most worrisome part.  This sounds less like a typical dream and more like a complex partial seizure (focal impaired awareness seizure).  The lack of memory, the buzzing, and the post-event exhaustion are key. This is where I'd seriously flag this with your doctor.\n* **Sleep Paralysis-like Episodes with Head Movement:**  This is also very concerning. The head movement and hitting the wall, combined with the amnesia, are red flags for a seizure.  *Even if it only happened once*, it's important to report.  The buzzing sensation during these is also concerning.\n\n**What Could It Be *Besides* Epilepsy?**\n\nIt's important to consider other possibilities:\n\n* **Migraine (Complex Migraine):** You've already been labeling some of this as \"migraine aura,\" and migraine can have a wide range of neurological symptoms *beyond* headache.  Complex migraines can include dissociation, sensory disturbances, and even temporary weakness. However, the sleep-related symptoms are less typical of migraine alone.\n* **Sleep Disorders:** Narcolepsy, sleep apnea, or other sleep disturbances could contribute to some of the sleep-related symptoms.\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Events (PNES):** These are events that *look* like seizures, but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They're often triggered by stress or trauma (though not always). A diagnosis requires ruling out epilepsy first.\n* **Anxiety/Stress:** While unlikely to cause all your symptoms, high anxiety can exacerbate dissociation and contribute to sleep disruption.\n\n\n\n\n**What to Tell Your Doctor (and Questions to Ask)**\n\n* **Be Detailed:** Describe each symptom, *exactly* as you've described them to me.  Include how often they happen, what seems to trigger them, and how they make you feel.\n* **Specifically Mention Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:**  \"I was researching my symptoms and learned about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, and I'm concerned there's some overlap. I'd like to discuss this possibility.\"\n* **Highlight the Sleep-Related Events:**  \"The episodes when I nap are particularly concerning. I become semi-conscious, have a buzzing sensation, and don't remember what happens. The incident where I hit my head during sleep is also worrying.\"\n* **Family History:**  \"I have a family history of epilepsy, though I don't know the specifics.\"\n* **Ask About Testing:**  \"What kind of tests would you recommend to investigate these symptoms?\"  (Likely options include an EEG \u2013 electroencephalogram \u2013 to measure brain activity, and potentially an MRI of the brain).\n* **Ask About Driving:** If you are driving, *ask* your doctor about whether these symptoms affect your ability to drive safely.\n* **Ask About a Sleep Study:**  Given the recurring sleep issues, an overnight sleep study might be beneficial.\n\n**Regarding Nicotine:** You're right to point out it seems unaffected. Nicotine is a stimulant and can sometimes increase seizure frequency in those predisposed, but its lack of impact in your case doesn't rule anything out.\n\n\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nYou're doing the right thing by being proactive and seeking medical attention. Your symptoms *do* warrant investigation.  While it could be something other than epilepsy, the possibility is significant enough to take seriously, *especially* the sleep-related events and the family history.   Don't self-diagnose, but go to your appointment prepared with detailed information and a clear list of questions.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds genuinely concerning and understandably frightening. It's good you're recognizing these patterns and taking it seriously. Here's a breakdown of potential causes, what you should do now, and what kind of specialist you should see.  I'll also preface this with the **important disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**Possible Causes (It's *crucial* to get this diagnosed by a professional \u2013 this is just a starting point for understanding):**\n\n* **Photophobia/Light Sensitivity (Beyond the Typical):** You mention a long-standing sensitivity.  While common, what you describe goes beyond normal discomfort. The degree of disorientation and nausea suggests something more pronounced.  This can be a symptom of a variety of underlying conditions.\n* **Visual Migraine (Acephalgic Migraine):**  Migraines don't *always* involve a headache.  \"Acephalgic\" or \"silent\" migraines can manifest as visual disturbances (auras) like flashing lights, distorted vision, and dizziness/nausea.  Reflections and intense, rapidly changing lights are common triggers.  The fact that it resolves with rest supports this.\n* **Vestibular Dysfunction:** Your vestibular system (inner ear) is responsible for balance and spatial orientation.  Strong visual input, particularly confusing or flickering patterns, *can* overload a slightly malfunctioning vestibular system, leading to dizziness and nausea.  Water reflections and complex LED displays are notorious for this.\n* **Pattern Sensitivity Epilepsy (Very Low Probability, But Needs Ruling Out):**  While you have no history of epilepsy, *pattern-sensitive epilepsy* is a specific type where flashing or complex visual patterns can trigger seizures (though seizures aren't always the classic convulsive kind; they can present as altered awareness, dizziness, or staring spells).  This is less likely given your description, but it requires exclusion.  The sudden onset and intensity raise this as a possibility, however remote.\n* **Occipital Lobe Dysfunction:** The occipital lobe is the part of the brain that processes visual information. Problems in this area *could* lead to visual distortions and related symptoms. This is less common, but a neurologist would evaluate for this.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** While not directly related to light, a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position (like sitting to looking up) *could* contribute to dizziness, especially if combined with visual stress. Less probable as the primary driver here, but worth mentioning.\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:**  Though you have no history, an underlying, previously undiagnosed neurological issue could be contributing.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do *Now*:**\n\n1. **Stop Driving at Night/In Triggering Situations:**  This is the most important thing. Your safety, and the safety of others, is paramount.  Avoid driving in the rain at night, through tunnels with intense lighting, or anywhere you've experienced these symptoms.  Find alternative transportation. DO NOT risk it.\n2. **Keep a Detailed Log:**  For the next week or two, meticulously record *every* instance of this happening, even minor ones. Include:\n   * **Date & Time**\n   * **Exact Location** (street, tunnel, etc.)\n   * **Weather Conditions**\n   * **Specifics of the Lights:** (LED, headlights, reflections, flickering, color)\n   * **What you were doing immediately before:** (Driving speed, looking straight ahead, checking mirrors, etc.)\n   * **Symptoms:**  (Describe the dizziness \u2013 spinning, lightheadedness, imbalance?  Nausea? Any visual distortions beyond the general glare?  Headache?  Any feeling of losing consciousness?)\n   * **How long the symptoms lasted**\n   * **What, if anything, made it better** (resting, closing eyes, etc.)\n3. **Primary Care Physician (PCP) Appointment:** Schedule an appointment with your PCP as soon as possible.  Bring your detailed log.  Explain your concerns clearly, emphasizing the impact on your ability to drive.  Your PCP can do an initial assessment, check your blood pressure, and begin the referral process.\n4. **Be Prepared for a Referral:** Your PCP will almost certainly refer you to\u2026\n\n\n\n\n**Which Specialist You Need to See:**\n\n**A Neuro-Ophthalmologist is the ideal first specialist.** They specialize in disorders affecting the visual system *and* the nervous system. They are best equipped to evaluate:\n\n* **Visual field testing**\n* **Eye movements and alignment**\n* **Examination of the optic nerve**\n* **Assessment of how your brain processes visual information**\n\nIf a neuro-ophthalmologist isn\u2019t available or easily accessible, a **Neurologist** is the next best option.  Specifically:\n\n* **Neurologist specializing in Epilepsy/Seizure Disorders (even though you have no history):** To rule out pattern-sensitive epilepsy.\n* **Neurologist with expertise in Migraine and Vestibular Disorders:**  To assess for migraine with aura or vestibular dysfunction.\n\n\n\n\n**What to expect during testing:**\n\n*   **Detailed Medical History:** Be prepared to answer a lot of questions about your symptoms, family history, medications, and lifestyle.\n*   **Neurological Exam:** This will assess your reflexes, coordination, strength, and sensory function.\n*   **Eye Exam:** A thorough eye exam to check your vision, eye movements, and the health of your eyes.\n*   **Possible Tests:**\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  To measure brain activity and rule out seizures.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** To look for any structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Vestibular Testing:** To assess the function of your inner ear.\n    *   **Visual Field Testing**:  To identify any blind spots or areas of impaired vision.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don\u2019t Self-Treat:** Avoid trying to \"power through\" these episodes.  Pull over when you feel symptoms developing.\n*   **Inform Family/Friends:**  Let people know what\u2019s happening so they can offer support and assistance.\n*   **Legal Implications:**  Be aware of the legal ramifications of driving with a medical condition that impairs your ability to operate a vehicle safely.

        "question": "Hello :) 26, male, 5'9, 87kg, Indian, generalised epilepsy for eight years, currently taking lamotrigine; I drink and live in the UK. I've had generalised epilepsy since I was 14, and it hasn't improved. I've had the same neurologist since I was diagnosed, and he told me nothing different to this date. It sucks because the only thing he ever tells me is they don't know the cause. At this age, it's still shit that I'm still not allowed to drive, I have seizures about once a month, and it worries me when I travel abroad or even at work. I would like to see if you guys have any advice, any different opinions or anything else that could help me. Thank you very much :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That *does* suck. It's incredibly frustrating to have a chronic condition with no clear answers, especially when it impacts your life so significantly. You're right to feel this way, and it's good you're actively looking for more information and potential avenues for improvement. Here's a breakdown of advice, potential options, and things to consider, broken down into sections.  This is a lot, so take it in chunks. **Please read the disclaimer at the very end!**\n\n**1. Addressing Your Current Situation & Concerns:**\n\n* **Seizure Frequency:**  1 seizure a month is *not* considered well-controlled epilepsy. While some people have infrequent seizures even on medication, the goal is generally seizure freedom, or at least a significant reduction in frequency and severity.  This needs to be the primary focus.\n* **Driving:** You\u2019re right to be frustrated about driving. UK regulations are strict (DVLA guidelines are your bible here: [https://www.gov.uk/driving-medical-conditions-epilepsy](https://www.gov.uk/driving-medical-conditions-epilepsy)).  The one-year seizure-free period is standard.\n* **Travel & Work:** The anxiety around travel and work is completely understandable. It's a constant burden.  We'll address potential ways to manage that anxiety further down.\n* **Lack of Neurologist Progress:**  Eight years with no new information is a concern. While sometimes the cause *remains* unknown, consistent lack of exploration feels inadequate. \n\n\n\n**2.  Seeking a Second Opinion (Crucial)**\n\nThis is the *most* important thing you should do. You've hit a wall with your current neurologist, and a fresh perspective is vital.\n\n* **Why a second opinion?**  Different neurologists have different areas of expertise, different approaches to diagnosis, and may be more up-to-date on current research.\n* **Finding a new neurologist:**\n    * **Ask for referrals:**  Your GP can refer you.\n    * **Epilepsy Specialist Centres:** The UK has designated Epilepsy Specialist Centres.  These are your best bet for the most experienced care.  Find one near you: [https://nationalepilepsy.org.uk/find-services/epilepsy-specialist-centres](https://nationalepilepsy.org.uk/find-services/epilepsy-specialist-centres)\n    * **Local Hospital Neurology Departments:**  Even if not a dedicated centre, a major hospital's neurology department might have more specialized expertise than a general neurologist.\n* **Prepare for the second opinion:**\n    * **Gather Records:**  Bring *everything* \u2013 seizure diaries (detailed! \u2013 see section 4), medication history, EEG results, MRI reports (if you've had them), any other relevant medical information.\n    * **Write down your questions:**  Don't rely on remembering.  Prepare a list of everything you want to discuss (see section 3 for potential questions).\n\n\n\n\n**3.  Questions to Ask a New Neurologist:**\n\n* **Re-evaluate the original diagnosis:**  Is generalized epilepsy still the correct classification?  Are there subtypes within generalized epilepsy that are more likely given your seizure type and history?\n* **Further Diagnostic Tests:**  Has everything been thoroughly investigated?  Consider asking about:\n    * **High-Resolution MRI:** Standard MRIs can miss subtle abnormalities. A high-resolution MRI can provide more detail.\n    * **Video-EEG Monitoring:**  This is *extremely* valuable.  You're monitored in hospital with continuous EEG recording while being deliberately induced to try and trigger a seizure (often through sleep deprivation or flashing lights \u2013 done safely under medical supervision). This captures the brain activity *during* a seizure, providing crucial information.\n    * **Genetic Testing:**  Epilepsy can sometimes have a genetic component.  Genetic testing is becoming more accessible.\n    * **Metabolic Screening:** While less common for generalized epilepsy, ruling out metabolic causes might be worthwhile.\n* **Treatment Alternatives:**\n    * **Lamotrigine Effectiveness:**  Is the current dosage optimal?  Has blood level monitoring been done to ensure it's in the therapeutic range?\n    * **Adding a Second Medication:**  Often, combining medications is more effective than increasing the dose of a single medication.\n    * **Other Medications:** Are there other medications that might be suitable, considering potential side effects and your lifestyle? (e.g., levetiracetam, brivaracetam, topiramate)\n    * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** This is an option for drug-resistant epilepsy.\n    * **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):** A more advanced option involving implantable devices that detect and respond to abnormal brain activity. (Typically reserved for more complex cases)\n* **Could this be a different type of epilepsy?**  Is there any possibility that focal epilepsy (starting in one specific area of the brain) is being mistaken for generalized?\n\n\n\n**4.  Detailed Seizure Diary & Tracking**\n\nThis is *extremely* important for both your current neurologist and any new neurologist you see.\n\n* **Record everything:**\n    * **Date and Time:** Precise timing.\n    * **Seizure Type:**  (Describe what happened \u2013 stiffening, jerking, loss of awareness, etc. Be as specific as possible.)  If you can, video record a seizure (safely!).\n    * **Triggers:**  What were you doing or feeling *before* the seizure? Stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, alcohol consumption, illness, etc.\n    * **Aura:**  Did you experience any warning signs *before* the seizure (e.g., unusual smells, tastes, feelings)?\n    * **Post-ictal Phase:**  How did you feel *after* the seizure (e.g., confused, tired, headache)?  How long did it last?\n    * **Medication Compliance:**  Were you taking your medication as prescribed?\n* **Apps:** There are useful seizure tracking apps available, like Seizure Tracker (Epilepsy Foundation).\n\n**5.  Lifestyle Considerations**\n\n* **Alcohol:** This is important being in the UK.  Alcohol can lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures, even the day after drinking. Be honest with your neurologist about your drinking habits.  Reducing or eliminating alcohol is strongly advised.\n* **Sleep:**  Prioritize regular sleep.  Sleep deprivation is a major seizure trigger. Aim for 7-9 hours per night.\n* **Stress Management:**  Find healthy ways to manage stress (exercise, meditation, yoga, hobbies).  Stress is a common trigger.\n* **Diet:** While there's no specific \"epilepsy diet\" for generalized epilepsy, a healthy, balanced diet is important.  Some people find the ketogenic diet helpful (but *only* under strict medical supervision).\n* **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can sometimes be a trigger.\n\n**6.  Support Networks**\n\n* **Epilepsy Action:**  Excellent resource for information, support, and advocacy in the UK: [https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/](https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/)\n* **National Epilepsy Society:** Another invaluable resource: [https://nationalepilepsy.org.uk/](https://nationalepilepsy.org.uk/)\n* **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  This response is based on currently available information, but medical knowledge is constantly evolving. Your individual circumstances are unique, and a personalized treatment plan is crucial.\n\n\n\n**To Sum Up:** Your priority should be getting a second opinion from an epilepsy specialist. Prepare thoroughly, track your seizures meticulously, and be open to exploring all potential treatment options.  Don't give up on finding a solution that improves your quality of life.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.  You\u2019re being proactive, and that\u2019s a really good sign.  Please feel free to ask if you have any further questions.  I wish you all the best."

        "question": "22F, 5\u20195, 173lb, whitehi there! weird thing happened last night and i\u2019m nervous and hoping someone might have some input for me. i recently started taking prozac (10mg) in conjunction with lamictal (125mg) (which i\u2019ve been on for about 6 weeks) for MDD. i\u2019ve had a huge decrease in appetite which has led to me forgetting to eat a lot. yesterday i ate very little - almost nothing, without realizing. i was smoking weed with my partner and i started to feel really unwell. i have a low tolerance so i didn\u2019t think much of it. i remember telling him i wanted to lay down, and next thing i knew i woke up to him holding me and saying my name over and over. he asked me a bunch of questions about my surroundings and personal information (address, birthday, etc.) to make sure i was aware and coherent. he said i was sitting there, mentioned i wanted to lay down, and then my body stiffened/seized up and i slid down the chair backwards until i was on the floor and he started trying to wake me up. he said in total, i was out for less than a minute, but he was worried i was having a seizure. while i was out, i was having what felt like a short lucid dream where i was rolling down a mountain, if that\u2019s important. when i came back to my senses, i was sweating a lot, and was nauseous. i laid on the floor for a little bit until i felt okay, and then went to bed. today i feel fine.i figured i just fainted bc i hadn\u2019t eaten and i was smoking, but i know serotonin syndrome can cause seizures so i\u2019m just feeling very anxious and wondering if i\u2019m worrying over nothing. i\u2019ve never fainted or had a seizure so i don\u2019t really know what either one feel like.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably very unsettling! You're right to be thinking through the possibilities, and it's good you're reaching out. Let's break this down, addressing your concerns about serotonin syndrome, fainting, seizures, and the medication interplay, and then what you should do.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is *not* a substitute for medical advice.**\n\n**Here's a detailed look at what might be going on, and the likelihood of each, given the information you've provided:**\n\n**1. Serotonin Syndrome:**\n\n*   **Possible, but less likely as a *first* event, given your dosages.** You are on two medications that *can* contribute to serotonin syndrome (Prozac and Lamictal).  However, your dosages are relatively low. Serotonin Syndrome is more common when starting or increasing doses of serotonergic medications.  The fact that this happened *after* your partner said you were already feeling unwell while smoking (likely contributing to low blood sugar plus the effect of the weed) makes it a slightly less probable primary cause.\n*   **Symptoms:** Serotonin syndrome can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including confusion, agitation, muscle rigidity, sweating, shivering, diarrhea, and in severe cases, seizures.  You did experience sweating and a suggestion of muscle stiffness (your partner describing your body \"stiffening\").\n*   **Why it's not immediately the highest concern:** Serotonin syndrome usually develops more gradually. A sudden, brief loss of consciousness *without* a constellation of other prominent symptoms makes it less likely to be the sole explanation.\n\n**2. Vasovagal Syncope (Fainting):**\n\n*   **Highly Possible.** This is a common cause of fainting, especially in situations involving stress, pain, dehydration, and \u2013 critically \u2013 *low blood sugar*. You mentioned having very little to eat all day, and smoking can sometimes lower blood pressure, and exacerbate low blood sugar. The combination is a strong setup for a vasovagal episode.\n*   **What it looks like:**  Often (but not always), there's a prodrome (warning signs) like feeling hot, sweaty, nauseous, lightheaded, or having blurred vision *before* losing consciousness. You described feeling unwell and wanting to lie down \u2013 that could be the beginning of this.  Sometimes, there's a brief muscle jerk or twitch before fainting, which could be what your partner saw as \"stiffening.\"\n*   **Brief Loss of Consciousness:**  Fainting episodes are often brief, lasting seconds to a minute or two, which aligns with your partner\u2019s account.  The sweating and nausea upon waking are also common.\n* **The \"lucid dream\"**: It's not uncommon to have a brief, dreamlike sensation during a faint as brain activity shifts.\n\n**3. Seizure:**\n\n*   **Less Likely, but Needs Consideration.**  You've never had a seizure before, and the description doesn't *perfectly* fit a typical generalized seizure. A classic seizure would typically involve more vigorous shaking or convulsions rather than just \"stiffening.\"  However, some seizures (absence seizures, for example) can be more subtle.\n*   **Why it's a concern:** Your partner's observation of your body stiffening/seizing and then falling is concerning enough to take seriously.\n*   **The lucid dream element:** This is a little atypical for a seizure, though not impossible.\n\n**4.  Interaction of Weed, Meds, and Low Blood Sugar:**\n\n* **Significant:**  This mixture could have lowered your blood pressure and/or blood sugar, making you more susceptible to fainting. Cannabis can interact with antidepressants in unpredictable ways, and individual responses vary.\n\n\n\n**What you should do *immediately*:**\n\n1.  **Contact Your Doctor (Psychiatrist or Primary Care Physician):** This is the *most* important step.  **Do not wait.** Explain everything that happened in detail, including:\n    *   The medications you're taking, and the dosages.\n    *   The timing of when you started the medications.\n    *   The fact that you hadn't eaten much.\n    *   The cannabis use.\n    *   Your partner's observations.\n    *   Your \"lucid dream\" experience.\n\n    Your doctor can assess the likelihood of serotonin syndrome, rule out other potential causes, and advise you on whether any adjustments to your medication are needed.  They may want to do a physical exam and potentially some blood tests.\n2.  **Avoid Cannabis for Now:**  Until you've spoken to your doctor, it's a good idea to avoid using cannabis, as it can complicate the picture.\n3.  **Prioritize Eating and Hydration:**  Make a conscious effort to eat regular meals and stay well-hydrated.  Even if you don't feel hungry, try to eat something small and nutritious.\n4.  **Keep a Detailed Log:**  For the next few days, keep a log of your symptoms, medication dosages, food intake, and any other relevant factors. This can be helpful for your doctor.\n5.  **Explain to your Partner**: Make sure your partner knows you've spoken to your doctor and to watch for any similar changes in your behavior and to be prepared to support you.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:** It's easy to get caught up in online research, but only a healthcare professional can accurately diagnose your condition.\n*   **Trust Your Gut:** You're correct to be concerned, and it's wise to seek medical advice.\n*   **Be Honest with Your Doctor:**  It\u2019s crucial to be open and honest about *all* substances you are using (including cannabis).\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The information provided here should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps!  I know you're anxious, and getting professional guidance will be the best way to address your concerns and ensure your safety.

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That is a *lot* to unpack, and it sounds incredibly frustrating and frightening. You've been through a really rough time with your epilepsy management, with a lot of miscommunication and seemingly inadequate care. You're understandably distressed, and it's good you reached out. Let's break down what might be happening, and why things have deteriorated, then talk about what steps you can take.  I will preface this by saying I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  This is for informational purposes only, and you *need* to have a thorough discussion with your neurologist.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of potential reasons why things have gone downhill, based on your history:**\n\n* **Misdiagnosis/Under-Recognition of Myoclonic Seizures:** This seems to be the core of the problem. From the start, your myoclonic seizures weren't consistently recognized as seizures.  That's a huge issue because those *are* seizures and require treatment.  They aren\u2019t harmless 'jerks\u2019 \u2013 they indicate ongoing electrical instability in the brain. This has led to broken periods of medication and stopped you getting adequate treatment.\n* **Inappropriate Medication Weaning:** Being taken off medication after experiencing *any* seizures (even just myoclonic ones) is concerning.  \"Seizure-free\" needs to be clearly defined \u2013 if you're still experiencing seizures, even milder forms, that's not seizure-free. Stopping medication prematurely, especially after a period of stability, increases the risk of breakthrough seizures.\n* **Pharmacological Mishaps & Poor Transition Plans:** The biggest issue currently, and what seems to have triggered the current problems, is the disastrous medication switch.  Your neurologist prescribing Lamotrigine at a ridiculously low dose (25mg when you'd been on 100mg+) while simultaneously expecting you to *stop* Keppra, without clear instructions, was a serious error.  This created a significant gap in seizure control. Essentially, you were left without adequate medication coverage.\n* **Medication Interactions/Dosage Imbalance:** The current cocktail of 100mg Lamotrigine + 2g Keppra (1g morning and 1g night) could be either helpful, ineffective, or causing side effects. Finding the right balance is crucial, and it requires careful titration and monitoring. It sounds like you\u2019re relying on Clobazam just to get to sleep because of the seizures. This isn\u2019t a sustainable long term solution.\n* **Sleep Deprivation as a Trigger:** You've highlighted a clear connection between sleep deprivation and increased seizure activity. This is extremely common in epilepsy. Insufficient sleep lowers the seizure threshold, making seizures more likely. This is even *more* important with your history of myoclonic seizures being exacerbated by sleep issues.\n* **Potential Underlying Cause Not Fully Investigated:** While ECGs were clear, it's worth revisiting if the initial investigations were comprehensive. Are there other potential underlying causes for your epilepsy that haven't been explored (genetic factors, structural brain abnormalities, etc.)?\n\n\n\n**Why the Current Situation Feels So Desperate:**\n\nIt\u2019s understandable you felt suicidal.  You were in a position where:\n\n* **You weren't being listened to:** You knew your body, you knew what was happening, but your concerns about myoclonic seizures were dismissed.\n* **You were left with inadequate medication:** The failed switch left you vulnerable.\n* **You were experiencing constant seizures:**  The unbroken myoclonic activity is incredibly draining and terrifying.\n\n\n\n**What You Need to Do *Now* (Crucial Steps):**\n\n1. **Immediate Neurologist Appointment (Different Neurologist if Possible):** This is paramount.  You need a neurologist who *fully* understands your history, *validates* your experience with myoclonic seizures, and is willing to work with you to find a stable medication regimen.  If you\u2019ve lost confidence in your current neurologist, seek a second opinion \u2013 and don't be afraid to shop around until you find someone you trust.\n2. **Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Start *immediately* tracking your seizures. Include:\n   * **Date/Time:**\n   * **Type of Seizure:** (specifically noting if it\u2019s myoclonic, tonic-clonic, etc.)\n   * **Duration:**\n   * **Potential Triggers:** (sleep deprivation, stress, illness, etc.)\n   * **Medications Taken & Time:**\n   * **Severity (1-10 scale)**\n3. **Discuss Medication Titration:**  Work with your neurologist to establish a proper medication plan.  This may involve:\n   * **Reviewing current dosages:**  Is the 100mg Lamotrigine + 2g Keppra the right balance?\n   * **Slow, careful titration:** Adjusting dosages gradually, *under medical supervision*, to find the optimal level of seizure control with minimal side effects.\n   * **Understanding medication interactions:** Ensuring there are no unwanted interactions between your medications.\n4. **Address Sleep:**  Prioritize sleep hygiene. This is *critical* for you.  Good sleep hygiene includes:\n   * **Consistent sleep schedule:** Go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends.\n   * **Relaxing bedtime routine:**  Avoid screens for an hour before bed.  Take a warm bath, read a book, listen to calming music.\n   * **Optimize your sleep environment:** Dark, quiet, and cool.\n5. **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to speak up!  You are the expert on your own body.  If you feel like your concerns aren\u2019t being heard, reiterate them, ask questions, and seek clarification. Bring a friend or family member to appointments if you feel more comfortable.\n6. **Explore Further Investigations:** Ask your neurologist if further investigations are warranted to determine the underlying cause of your epilepsy.\n\n**Regarding the Clobazam:**\n\nClobazam is a benzodiazepine and has potential for dependence. It's not a long-term solution for preventing myoclonic seizures. It's useful for *acute* control, but you need to address the underlying seizure activity with appropriate anti-epileptic drugs.\n\n**Important Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)  (Excellent information, support, and resources)\n* **National Epilepsy Foundation:**  (Search for your local chapter)\n\n\n\n**You are not alone in this.** Many people with epilepsy struggle to find the right treatment plan. It takes time, patience, and a strong working relationship with your healthcare team.  Don\u2019t give up advocating for yourself. This is a complex situation, and you deserve to have your concerns taken seriously and to receive the best possible care.  \n\nI sincerely hope this breakdown is helpful.  Please prioritize seeing a neurologist and taking proactive steps to manage your epilepsy.  Take care, and remember that there is hope for improved seizure control and a better quality of life.\n\n\n\n"

        "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine? I'm a very careful person but even then, I don't want to endanger myself unnecessarily. Thanks in advance!",

How Common is This & What Could Be Happening?**\n\nYou're right that epilepsy is most commonly associated with seizures, but it's *far* from the only cause. A single, unprovoked seizure (that's what it sounds like this was, since you have no known history) is surprisingly more common than most people think.  Here's the breakdown of possibilities, keeping in mind doctors will be trying to narrow these down:\n\n* **First-Time Seizure (Idiopathic):**  Many people have a single seizure with no identifiable cause. These are called idiopathic seizures.  It's frustrating, but sometimes they just happen.  Often, people with this type of seizure *never* have another one.  However, it does warrant investigation to rule out other causes.\n* **Provoked Seizure:** These are seizures triggered by a temporary, reversible factor. Some common triggers include:\n    * **Fever:** Especially in younger individuals.\n    * **Electrolyte Imbalance:**  Sodium, calcium, magnesium, glucose \u2013 any of these being too high or too low can cause seizures. Your blood tests would have looked at this.\n    * **Medication Related:** The Wellbutrin dosage reduction is a smart move. Certain medications, even when taken as prescribed, can lower the seizure threshold (make a seizure more likely).\n    * **Sleep Deprivation:** A significant factor.\n    * **Stress:** High levels of stress can contribute.\n    * **Flashing Lights/Patterns:** (Photosensitivity \u2013 less common, but considered)\n    * **Dehydration:** Being at the beach in the heat could play a role.\n    * **Substance Use/Withdrawal:**  (You didn't mention this, but it's a common consideration in ERs)\n* **Underlying Medical Condition:** While your initial tests were normal, some conditions can present without immediate signs. The MRI is critical to rule some of these out.  These could include:\n    * **Brain Tumor:** (Very important to rule out with the MRI)\n    * **Vascular Malformation:**  An abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain.\n    * **Silent Stroke:** A stroke that doesn't cause obvious symptoms initially.\n    * **Infection:**  Rare, but possible.\n* **Genetic Predisposition:** Sometimes there's a genetic component, even if no one else in your family has a known seizure disorder.\n\nThe fact that your initial workup (blood, urine, EKG, CT) was normal is good news. It doesn't *rule things out*, but it makes some possibilities less likely. The MRI will be crucial for more detailed brain imaging.  Your neurologist is the best person to explain the probabilities in your specific case.\n\n**Regarding the foam:** That's a common occurrence in tonic-clonic seizures. It's saliva mixed with air.\n\n\n\n**2. Returning to Hobbies \u2013 Dancing & Sewing**\n\nThis is a very reasonable question, and it's wise to be cautious.  Here's a thoughtful approach:\n\n* **Wait for Neurologist's Clearance:**  This is *the most important* thing. Do *not* resume these activities until your neurologist has reviewed your MRI results and given you specific guidance.\n* **Consider the Risk:**\n    * **Dancing:**  The risk here is falling. If you were to have another seizure *while* dancing, the consequences could be significant.  Also, vigorous physical exertion can, in some cases, potentially trigger a seizure (though this is less common).\n    * **Sewing Machine:**  The risk here is a rapid, jerky movement of your hand potentially causing injury from the needle if you were to have a seizure.\n* **Gradual Return (With Neurologist's Approval):** When you do get the okay, it's best to ease back in:\n    * **Start Slow:** Don't immediately jump into a high-intensity dance class or a complex sewing project. Begin with gentler activities.\n    * **Safe Environment:**  If dancing, choose a class with a soft floor and plenty of space. When sewing, make sure you\u2019re sitting comfortably and well-supported.\n    * **Buddy System:** Initially, have someone with you, especially when dancing.  Your partner being an EMT is fantastic for peace of mind.  Even with sewing, let someone know you're working on a project.\n    * **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel any unusual sensations (dizziness, lightheadedness, a \"funny\" feeling) *stop immediately*.\n\n**Important Precautions You're Already Taking - Keep Them Up!**\n\n* **Wellbutrin Adjustment:** Excellent that you're following this.\n* **Staying with Family/Partner:**  Having support is crucial, especially in the immediate aftermath.\n* **No Driving:**  Absolutely the right decision.  Most states have regulations about driving after a seizure.\n* **Limited Screen Time:** While the link between screen time and seizures isn't fully understood, reducing potentially stimulating factors is prudent.\n\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nYou're doing all the right things \u2013 seeking medical attention, following advice, being cautious, and asking good questions.  This is a scary situation, but the fact that your initial tests were normal is encouraging. Stay in close communication with your neurologist, prioritize your health, and listen to your body. \n\nI truly hope you get some answers soon and that this remains a one-time event.  \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  Again, I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hello, I am 24 and I was diagnosed with epilepsy around 2 years ago, and prior to this I thought epilepsy was 1) you were born with it, and 2) it was caused due to flashing lights. My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had. I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, it's completely understandable why you had those initial misconceptions about epilepsy. They're *very* common! It's great you're seeking more information, and it sounds like you're being proactive about understanding your condition.  Let's break down what you're describing, and address the \"out of nowhere\" aspect.  I'll give you a lot of information here, but please remember **I am not a medical professional.** This is for informational purposes only and absolutely *does not* substitute for the advice of your neurologist.  You need to discuss all of this with your doctor.\n\n**First: Debunking the Myths**\n\nYou\u2019re right to question your original understanding.\n\n* **Not always present at birth:** While some types of epilepsy *are* genetic and present from a young age (childhood-onset epilepsies), a *very* significant number of people develop epilepsy as adults.  This is what you seem to be experiencing.  These are often called \"acquired\" or \"late-onset\" epilepsies.  The cause can sometimes be found, but often it isn\u2019t readily apparent.\n* **Flashing lights (Photosensitive Epilepsy):**  This is only one specific type of epilepsy, and it affects a relatively small percentage of people with epilepsy (around 3%). You are clearly showing you're not photosensitive, which is good to know.\n\n\n\n**Understanding \"Seizures Coming Out of Nowhere\" - The Reality of Cryptogenic Epilepsy**\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing \u2013 seizures appearing without obvious triggers \u2013 is actually quite common. This is often referred to as **cryptogenic epilepsy**. \"Cryptogenic\" means \"of unknown cause.\" Here\u2019s a deeper dive:\n\n* **It doesn't mean there *is no* cause:**  It means the cause isn't *currently* identifiable with the tools and tests available.  Neurologists continue to learn more about epilepsy, and sometimes with advanced testing (like detailed MRI, long-term video EEG monitoring), a subtle cause can be found even years later.\n* **Potential Underlying Causes (Even if Unidentifiable Now):**  Even if it feels random, there's brain activity driving these seizures. Some possibilities (that your doctor will likely be exploring/have explored) include:\n    * **Subtle Brain Abnormalities:**  There could be a very small structural abnormality in the brain (a tiny area of malformation, a scar from a minor infection you didn't even remember, etc.) that disrupts brain activity. These may not show up on standard imaging.\n    * **Genetic Predisposition:** You might have a genetic vulnerability that wasn\u2019t expressed earlier in life.  Sometimes genes are \"triggered\" by some unknown environmental factor.\n    * **Previous, Unrecognized Head Injury:** Even a seemingly minor head injury from childhood could contribute, even if there was no loss of consciousness.\n    * **Autoimmune Factors:**  In some cases, the immune system can mistakenly attack the brain, leading to seizures.\n    * **Inflammation:** Subtle inflammation in the brain can cause abnormal electrical activity.\n    * **Ion Channelopathies:** Problems with the tiny channels in brain cells that control electrical signals.\n* **Spontaneous Neural Network Changes:**  The brain is incredibly complex. Sometimes, spontaneous changes in the way neural networks communicate can lead to a seizure, even in a healthy brain.  In people with a predisposition to epilepsy, this is more likely to occur.\n\n**Types of Seizures and Why \"No Trigger\" Can Still Make Sense**\n\nThe *type* of seizure you have matters a lot. Different seizure types have different characteristics:\n\n* **Focal Seizures:** These start in one area of the brain. They can be with or without impaired awareness.  You might experience strange sensations, emotions, or movements.  Sometimes these can spread to become a generalized seizure.\n* **Generalized Seizures:**  These involve the entire brain from the start.  Types include:\n    * **Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal):**  What many people picture when they think of a seizure \u2013 loss of consciousness, stiffening, jerking.\n    * **Absence Seizures (Petit Mal):**  Brief lapses in awareness, often appearing as staring.\n    * **Myoclonic Seizures:**  Sudden, brief jerks of muscles.\n\nThe \"out of nowhere\" feeling is more common with **focal seizures that don't immediately generalize**.  You might just have a momentary odd sensation and not even realize it's a seizure.  Generalized seizures, while seeming random, are often linked to more widespread disruption in brain activity.\n\n**What you should discuss with your neurologist:**\n\n* **Detailed Seizure Description:**  The more detail you can provide about *exactly* what happens during a seizure (even the subtle ones), the better.  What do you feel? What do you see?  What happens to your body?\n* **EEG Results:**  An EEG (electroencephalogram) measures brain electrical activity.  Discuss the results of your EEGs with your doctor.  Even a \"normal\" EEG doesn't always rule out epilepsy, especially if seizures are infrequent. You may need prolonged or ambulatory EEG monitoring.\n* **MRI Results:** An MRI scan provides detailed images of the brain. Review the findings with your neurologist.\n* **Medication Review:** Are your current medications controlling your seizures effectively? Are you experiencing side effects?  Don\u2019t adjust medications on your own.\n* **Further Testing:** Ask about the possibility of further investigations, such as:\n    * **High-resolution MRI:**  More detailed imaging\n    * **Long-term Video EEG Monitoring:**  This involves wearing an EEG for several days or weeks while being video recorded.  It can help capture a seizure and pinpoint its origin.\n    * **Neurological Examination:** Regular check-ups and assessments.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out metabolic or autoimmune causes.\n* **Seizure Action Plan:**  You should have a clear plan in place for what to do if you have a seizure, both for yourself and for people who might be with you.\n\n\n\n**Living with \"Unexplained\" Epilepsy**\n\nIt can be frustrating not to have a clear answer about *why* this is happening. Here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Focus on Management:**  The most important thing is to manage your epilepsy effectively with medication (if prescribed) and lifestyle adjustments.\n* **Identify Potential Patterns (Even if Subtle):**  Keep a seizure diary.  Note the date, time, any possible stressors, your sleep patterns, your diet, and anything else that might be relevant.  Even if you don\u2019t see a clear trigger, patterns can emerge over time.\n* **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle:**  Get enough sleep, manage stress, eat a balanced diet, and avoid excessive alcohol consumption.\n* **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to ask questions and express your concerns to your neurologist.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Society (UK):** [https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/)\n* **Epilepsy Action (UK):** [https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/](https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/)\n* **National Epilepsy Foundation (US - but useful information):** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n\n\n\n**To reiterate:** Please, *please* discuss all of this with your neurologist.  They are the best resource for understanding your specific case and developing a tailored treatment plan.  Don't self-diagnose or make changes to your medication without their guidance.\n\n\n\nI hope this information is helpful.  Living with epilepsy can be challenging, but with proper management and support, you can live a full and active life.  Good luck!"

        "question": "I am not a doctor, but I know my body and I am no fool. I also try to avoid going to the doctor unless necessary, so I try to make sure I have to go before I do. My doctors tend to mark me up to either being a hypochondriac or having drug seeking behaviour.For example: I have very severe epilepsy, and the Keppra I am on is no longer working; I am having multiple seizures in a row every month along with, almost constant myoclonic jerks in my legs. I asked my doctor to please change me from the Keppra about 6 months ago, when it first started showing signs of no longer working. Last month I had 9 focal-to-generalized seizures without becoming aware between them.In short, pharmaceutical companies tell me to ask my doctor about certain meds, but when I do, they blow me off.Bonus Question: What do you recommend for these seizures? They are almost always triggered by hormones, stress level, and being asleep.Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're in a really frustrating situation, and I absolutely hear your frustration. You are advocating for yourself, *knowing* your body, and that's incredibly important. It's also awful that you're facing dismissal and negatively framed labels from your doctors when you're genuinely experiencing a worsening of a serious condition. Let's break this down, address your concerns, and then I'll tackle the bonus question with a *very important disclaimer* at the end.\n\n**Understanding the Challenges You're Facing**\n\n* **The \"Hypochondriac/Drug-Seeking\" Label:** This is a huge problem.  Once a doctor starts thinking this way, it biases *everything* they hear from you. It's incredibly difficult to overcome.  It sounds like you are very proactive about your health, but when a doctor starts to see all concern as being overblown, it can be difficult for them to listen.\n* **Medication Ineffectiveness & Doctor Hesitancy:** Keppra (levetiracetam) is a good drug for many, but it *definitely* can lose effectiveness over time.  The fact that you've experienced a clear increase in seizure frequency AND are experiencing breakthrough seizures (multiple in a row) is a significant indicator it's not controlling your epilepsy anymore.  The hesitation to switch, especially after 6 months of reporting this, is concerning.\n* **Pharmaceutical Influence:** You're right to be aware of pharmaceutical marketing.  It's not about the medications being inherently bad, but about the potential for biased information, and your doctor\u2019s own biases. It\u2019s also important that doctors stay up to date on all of the medicines that are available for treatment.\n* **Hormonal/Stress/Sleep Triggers:**  These are *very* common seizure triggers, especially with certain types of epilepsy. It's good you've identified these. This information is crucial for potential treatment adjustments.\n\n\n\n**What You Can Do (Advocacy Strategies)**\n\n1. **Detailed Seizure Log:** This is your most powerful tool.  Don't just say \"I had 9 seizures last month.\"  Document *everything*:\n    * **Date & Time:** Precise time of each seizure.\n    * **Type of Seizure:** (Focal to generalized - you already know this, that's good).  If possible, detail *how* it started (what was the first symptom you noticed?).\n    * **Duration:** How long did the seizure last?\n    * **Post-Ictal State:** How long were you confused, tired, or experiencing other effects *after* the seizure?\n    * **Triggers:**  What were you doing? What was your stress level?  Where were you in your menstrual cycle (if applicable)?  How had your sleep been in the days leading up to the seizure?\n    * **Medication Adherence:**  Confirm you've been taking your Keppra as prescribed.\n    * **Any Changes:** Any new medications, supplements, lifestyle changes, illnesses, etc.\n\n2. **\"I'm Not Here to Argue, I'm Here to Collaborate\" Approach:** In your next appointment, try this:\n   *  \"I understand you have concerns about my reporting, and I appreciate you wanting to be careful. However, I am genuinely experiencing a significant worsening of my epilepsy despite being compliant with my medication.  I\u2019ve been keeping a detailed seizure log (hand it over), and I'm asking for a thoughtful discussion about possible adjustments to my treatment plan.\"\n   * Specifically state: \"I am not asking for a specific medication, I am asking for evaluation to find one that will work for me.\"\n\n3. **Second Opinion:**  If your current doctor continues to dismiss your concerns, *absolutely* seek a second opinion.  A neurologist specializing in epilepsy (an epileptologist) is ideal.  Look for someone at a comprehensive epilepsy center (often affiliated with major hospitals).  These centers have more specialized expertise and resources.\n\n4. **Bring a Support Person:**  Having a friend or family member with you can be helpful. They can provide a witness to your concerns and help advocate for you.\n\n5. **Frame it as Quality of Life:**  Instead of just focusing on seizure numbers, talk about how this is impacting your life.  \"These seizures are affecting my ability to work/drive/maintain relationships/feel safe.\"\n\n6. **Written Summary:** After the appointment, send a brief email summarizing your concerns and the agreed-upon plan (or lack thereof). This creates a written record.\n\n\n\n**Bonus Question: Recommendations for Seizures Triggered by Hormones, Stress, & Sleep**\n\nOkay, this is where things get tricky because I am *not* a medical professional and cannot give medical advice.  However, here's information that your doctor *should* be considering, and ideas to discuss:\n\n* **Hormonal Seizures (Catamenial Epilepsy):**\n    * **Hormone Level Monitoring:**  Tracking hormone levels throughout your cycle can help pinpoint exactly when seizures are more likely.\n    * **Adjusting Medication:** Some medications may need to be adjusted (dosage) around your cycle.\n    * **Hormonal Birth Control:** The impact of birth control on seizures is complex.  Some types can worsen seizures, others may help. This needs careful discussion with your neurologist.\n* **Stress-Related Seizures:**\n    * **Stress Management Techniques:**  This is crucial.  Things like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, and therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy/CBT is often helpful) can all make a difference.\n    * **Biofeedback:**  A technique that helps you gain control over physiological responses to stress.\n* **Sleep-Related Seizures:**\n    * **Sleep Hygiene:**  Strict sleep schedule, dark/quiet/cool bedroom, avoid caffeine/alcohol before bed.\n    * **Sleep Study:**  To rule out other sleep disorders (like sleep apnea) that may be contributing.\n    * **Medication Timing:**  Your doctor may consider adjusting the timing of your medication to provide better coverage during sleep.\n\n* **Medication Options to *Discuss* With Your Doctor:**  (These are just examples, your doctor will evaluate what\u2019s appropriate)\n    * **Lamotrigine:** Often good for hormonal influences.\n    * **Brivaracetam (Briviact):**  Sometimes well-tolerated and a good alternative to Keppra.\n    * **Topiramate (Topamax):** Can have side effects, but effective for some.\n    * **Clonazepam (Klonopin):**  (Benzodiazepine) - Often used for rescue medication or short-term control, but has potential for dependence. Not usually a first-line long-term treatment.\n    * **Perampanel (Fycompa):** May be an option for focal seizures.\n\n\n\n\n**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\n**I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.**  The information above is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to discuss any changes to your medication or treatment plan with a qualified healthcare professional.  *Do not* self-treat or make any changes to your medications without your doctor's guidance. You need a proper neurological evaluation to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.  \n\n\n\n**Your health is important, and you deserve to be heard and taken seriously.** Keep advocating for yourself, and don't give up until you find a healthcare provider who partners with you in managing your epilepsy. You are not alone in this. There are resources available to help you navigate the healthcare system and find the support you need.\n\n\n\nHere are some helpful organizations:\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n*   **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS):** [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/)\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope this helps, and I wish you the very best in getting the care you deserve."

        "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a *very* difficult and frightening situation. You are right to be scared, and you're doing a lot already, but it's escalating rapidly. Here's a breakdown of advice, addressing the medical, emotional, and family dynamics, along with a strong emphasis on your safety and well-being.  I will also include a *disclaimer* at the end, as I'm an AI and can't provide medical advice.\n\n**1. Medical Emergency - Prioritize His Health (and potentially yours):**\n\n* **Four grand mals in a day is a medical emergency.**  The fact that he had one a couple of weeks ago after relative control is a huge red flag.  His brain is clearly destabilizing.  *Regardless* of his license concerns, his life is more important.  Repeated seizures can cause brain damage, aspiration pneumonia, and even death.\n* **Call 911 (or your local emergency number).**  I understand the fear of losing his license. *However*, explain the situation to the dispatcher *clearly*.  Tell them he has a history of seizures, has had a temporal lobe resection, and is now experiencing a cluster of seizures.  They may be able to transport him without automatically involving a driving suspension evaluation (it varies by location).  Alternatively, could he be transported by a non-emergency medical transport, if available?\n* **If they threaten license suspension, ask specifically about options.**  Many jurisdictions have procedures for reporting seizures without automatic license loss, *especially* with a documented medical condition.  Advocate for this.\n* **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed log of the seizures: time, duration, what happened *before* (any stressors, missed meds, changes in routine), and what happened *after*. This is crucial information for doctors.\n* **Regarding his refusal of meds:** This is common in post-ictal states (the period after a seizure) and can be due to confusion or cognitive impairment.  It's frustrating, but you can\u2019t force medication on him. Your priority right now isn't arguing about meds, it's *getting him to the hospital*.\n\n\n\n**2. Addressing the Family Dynamics (This is tricky):**\n\n* **Their reasoning is extremely concerning.** The grandmother's dismissal (\"this happens sometimes\") and urging you *not* to seek medical help are deeply problematic.  It sounds like they are prioritizing avoiding the inconvenience of dealing with the license implications over his well-being.  This is not okay.\n* **You are new to the situation.** They have a long history and may be operating from a place of fear and learned helplessness. However, that doesn't excuse potentially harmful advice.\n* **Gently push back (if safe).**  You can say something like, \"I understand this has happened before, but four seizures in one day feels different and really worrying. I need to do what I feel is best to ensure his safety.\"  Expect resistance.  Don't get into a prolonged argument right now.\n* **Once the immediate crisis is addressed, consider a family meeting** (with him, if he\u2019s able and willing, and the grandmother).  You can express your concerns and ask for more transparency about his medical history, medications, and seizure triggers.  However, based on the current situation, this might be best facilitated by a medical professional (see #4).\n* **Be prepared to be the 'bad guy'.** They might resent you for calling an ambulance. You need to be okay with that, knowing you acted out of care and concern.\n\n\n\n**3. Taking Care of *You*:**\n\n* **This is incredibly stressful.**  Witnessing seizures is traumatic.  You are in a highly vulnerable position.\n* **Self-Care is essential.**  Even in the middle of this, try to take a few deep breaths.  Eat something. Lean on a friend or family member *for support*. You need someone to talk to.\n* **Recognize your limits.** You are not a medical professional.  You are not responsible for managing his condition alone.  You are doing your best, but you can\u2019t fix this on your own.\n* **Your emotional well-being matters.** If his behavior toward you continues to be abusive or dismissive, you need to prioritize your own safety and mental health.  Living with someone with uncontrolled seizures *and* who is verbally aggressive is unsustainable.\n\n\n\n\n**4. Long-Term Steps (Once the immediate crisis is stabilized):**\n\n* **Neurologist Appointment ASAP.** He needs a thorough re-evaluation by his neurologist.  The medication may need to be adjusted, or further investigations (like an EEG) may be necessary.\n* **Consider a Social Worker/Case Manager.**  A social worker specializing in epilepsy can help navigate the medical system, access resources, and potentially facilitate communication with the family. They can also address the license concerns and advocate for his needs.\n* **Power of Attorney/Healthcare Proxy:**  This is a sensitive topic, but it\u2019s important.  If he is willing, discuss establishing a healthcare proxy, giving you (or someone else he trusts) the authority to make medical decisions on his behalf if he is unable to.\n* **Support Groups:**  Look for support groups for partners/family members of people with epilepsy. Sharing experiences and learning from others can be incredibly helpful.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Sudden increases in seizure frequency often indicate a problem with medication adherence, a new medical issue, or a change in brain activity.**  It *needs* to be investigated.\n* **You are not overreacting.** Your fear is valid.  You are doing the right thing by seeking help, even if his family disagrees.\n* **Do not put yourself in danger.** If he becomes agitated or aggressive during or after a seizure, prioritize your safety.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  **Please call 911 or your local emergency number if you believe your partner is in immediate danger.**\n\n\n\nYou are in a tough spot, and I commend you for reaching out.  You are clearly a caring person.  Trust your instincts, prioritize his health and your own safety, and don't hesitate to seek help from professionals.  I sincerely hope things improve for both of you."

        "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, let's break down the relationship between anxiety, stress, and epilepsy/seizures, especially considering your age and gender. It's good you're asking this question. Here's a comprehensive overview, but **please read the important disclaimer at the end regarding seeking professional medical advice.**\n\n**Can Anxiety/Stress *Trigger* Seizures? (Yes, but it's complex)**\n\n* **Not a Direct Cause, Usually:** Generally, anxiety and stress *don't* cause epilepsy itself. Epilepsy is usually due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain often stemming from a structural or genetic predisposition.  However, they can significantly *lower the seizure threshold*, meaning they make it easier for a seizure to start *in someone who is already prone to seizures or has an underlying susceptibility*.\n* **Triggering Factor:**  For someone *with* epilepsy, anxiety and stress are very common seizure triggers.  Think of it like this: the brain is already somewhat unstable, and stress pushes it over the edge.  The mechanisms involve things like:\n    * **Neurotransmitter Imbalances:** Stress affects neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) like GABA (which calms the brain) and glutamate (which excites the brain). Stress can disrupt this balance, potentially leading to increased excitability.\n    * **Hormonal Changes:**  Stress hormones like cortisol can also impact brain activity and increase seizure risk.\n    * **Sleep Disruption:** Anxiety often leads to poor sleep, and sleep deprivation is a well-known seizure trigger.\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** This is where things get trickier.  PNES *look* like epileptic seizures, but they aren't caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Instead, they are caused by psychological distress \u2013 often anxiety, trauma, or other emotional issues.  The body's response to overwhelming psychological stress manifests as physical symptoms resembling a seizure.  PNES are *involuntary* \u2013 the person isn't faking it. They are a genuine neurological condition, but with a different origin than epilepsy.  These are more common in women and girls, but *do* occur in males.\n\n**Can Anxiety/Stress Lead to Epilepsy *in Someone with No Previous History*? (Less Common, but Possible \u2013 Several Scenarios)**\n\nThis is the core of your question, and it's more nuanced. It's less likely than the triggering scenario above, but here's where it can happen:\n\n1. **Underlying, Undiagnosed Predisposition:** You might have a subtle, underlying brain vulnerability that you were unaware of. This could be a very mild structural abnormality, a genetic predisposition that hasn't manifested, or a subtle difference in brain chemistry.  In this case, a period of intense stress *could* be the event that finally pushes the brain into having a seizure.  It's not that the stress *caused* the epilepsy, but it *unmasked* it.  This is something doctors would try to determine through testing.\n2. **Acute Stress and Febrile Seizures (less likely at 17, but worth mentioning):** Although more common in young children, very high fever combined with extreme stress *could* potentially trigger a first-time seizure. (This is usually a one-off event and doesn't lead to epilepsy).\n3. **Severe Trauma/Psychological Shock:** In *extremely* rare cases, a profoundly traumatic event can, in theory, contribute to the development of epilepsy, but it's a complex and not well-understood relationship.  This wouldn't be a simple \"stress leads to epilepsy\" situation, but rather a severe neurological impact from the trauma.\n4. **Post-Traumatic Epilepsy:** If you've experienced a head injury (even if it seemed mild at the time), coupled with significant stress,  there's a slightly increased risk of developing post-traumatic epilepsy.  This is different from stress *causing* epilepsy, it's the injury causing it, with stress potentially being a contributing factor to earlier onset.\n5. **First Episode Psychosis/Other Psychiatric Conditions:** Sometimes, a first psychotic episode or a very severe mood disorder can present with symptoms that *look* like seizures.  This is crucial to differentiate from epilepsy.\n\n\n\n**Your Age (17) is Important**\n\n* **Developing Brain:** The teenage years are a period of significant brain development.  This makes the brain potentially more vulnerable to disruption from stress.\n* **Hormonal Changes:** Puberty brings hormonal shifts that can also influence brain activity.\n* **Increased Stress:**  Teenagers face a lot of academic, social, and personal pressure, making them susceptible to high levels of stress and anxiety.\n\n**What to do if you are concerned:**\n\n* **See a Doctor IMMEDIATELY:** If you've experienced a seizure, or are having symptoms that *might* be seizures (e.g., staring spells, loss of awareness, jerking movements, confusion), it's vital to be evaluated by a medical professional.  Don't try to self-diagnose.\n* **Be Honest About Anxiety and Stress:** Tell your doctor about any anxiety, stress, or trauma you're experiencing.  This information is crucial for accurate diagnosis.\n* **Diagnostic Tests:** A doctor will likely order tests, such as:\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** Measures brain electrical activity.  This is the primary test for diagnosing epilepsy.\n    * **MRI or CT Scan of the Brain:** Looks for structural abnormalities.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out other potential causes.\n* **Mental Health Support:** Regardless of whether or not a physical cause for seizures is found, addressing your anxiety and stress is essential.  Consider talking to a therapist or counselor.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

If so, can you describe what happened?\n*   Do you have a history of anxiety or other mental health conditions?\n*   Have you recently experienced any significant stressors or trauma?\n*   Have you ever had a head injury?\n\n\n\n\n"

        "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

Pylori Test\u2014Negative I know this is a lot of info, but I am open to hearing any ideas. She's in constant pain, it never goes away, just goes from at least a 4 up to 9-10 on the pain scale. No fevers, no vomiting, no nausea.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this *is* a lot of information, and it's understandable why you're deeply concerned.  Given the complexity of your daughter's medical history, the persistent and worsening abdominal pain, weight loss, and now dizziness/lightheadedness leading to a fall, this needs urgent and thorough investigation.  Here's a breakdown of potential considerations, organized to help you advocate for her care.  I will also emphasize *what you need to communicate to her medical team.*  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response.**\n\n**I. Prioritization: Ruling Out Urgent Issues**\n\nThis is the first step.  While blood work has been normal, it doesn't rule out everything.  The dizziness and fall are significant.\n\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:**  Her medications (Clonidine, Keppra, potentially Lamictal) can all contribute to low blood pressure, especially when standing.  This could explain the dizziness. *Needs to be formally checked with orthostatic blood pressure measurements (lying, sitting, standing).* This is especially important given her temperature regulation issues and potential for autonomic dysfunction.\n* **Cardiac:** Although less likely given her history, a quick cardiac evaluation (ECG) is prudent to rule out any subtle heart rhythm issues contributing to dizziness.\n* **Internal Bleeding:**  While no vomiting or nausea, slow, chronic blood loss can sometimes present with fatigue, lightheadedness, and abdominal discomfort. This would be less likely with normal CBC, but it's worth considering if the pain is persistent.\n* **Bowel Obstruction (Partial):** Given her colon issues and medication regimen, *a partial bowel obstruction is a serious concern.*  Even if not complete, it can cause pain, distention, and reduced appetite.  The Linzess and Bisacodyl are stimulating agents, and prolonged use can potentially contribute to imbalance.\n* **Dehydration:**  If she's not eating or drinking well, even mild dehydration can exacerbate dizziness and contribute to malaise.\n\n\n\n**II. Focused Investigation \u2013 Addressing the Abdominal Pain & Associated Symptoms**\n\nThis is where the more complex diagnostic work needs to be done.  Here's a tiered approach:\n\n* **1. Detailed Gastrointestinal Evaluation (Beyond What's Been Done):**\n    * **Repeat Abdominal Imaging:**  A repeat CT Scan (with and without contrast) or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis is warranted to *specifically* assess the colon, bladder, and surrounding structures.  Look for:\n        *  Strictures (narrowing) in the colon.\n        *  Significant distention.\n        *  Evidence of inflammation (though inflammation often shows up in blood work, it doesn't always).\n        *  Masses (unlikely, but need to rule out).\n        *  Assess for any abnormalities near the bladder.\n    * **Gastric Emptying Study:** This assesses how quickly food leaves her stomach.  The feeling of a \u201clump in the throat\u201d and early satiety could indicate delayed gastric emptying (Gastroparesis).\n    * **Small Intestinal Follow Through (SIFT) or Capsule Endoscopy:** To evaluate the small intestine, which is harder to visualize.\n    * **Anorectal Manometry:** Assess anal sphincter function. Could help to clarify the reports of internal sphincter dysfunction, though this is often difficult to fully assess.\n* **2. Neurological Considerations (Due to Epilepsy & Neuropathy):**\n    * **Neurology Review:**  A thorough review by her neurologist is essential.  Her epilepsy and neuropathy could be contributing to the abdominal pain in complex ways (visceral pain perception, altered nerve signaling).\n    * **Autonomic Testing:** Given her Raynaud's, temperature regulation issues, and potential for orthostatic hypotension, a formal autonomic function test is critical. This can assess how well her autonomic nervous system is working, which regulates blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, and other essential functions.\n* **3. Psychological Component:**\n    * **Re-evaluate Anxiety:**  While a diagnosis exists, the severity of her pain might be *exacerbated* by anxiety.  A mental health professional experienced in chronic pain is crucial. (Pain can also *cause* anxiety, so it's a bidirectional relationship). *However*, do not dismiss the pain as \"just anxiety.\"  It needs a full medical workup *first*.\n* **4.  Medication Review:** (See section III)\n\n\n\n\n**III.  Medication Concerns & Potential Interactions**\n\nThis requires a very careful review with her doctors, *especially* a pharmacist familiar with her complex regimen.\n\n* **Linzess/Bisacodyl:**   The combination of these medications, along with Lactulose, is a powerful stimulant regimen.  Long-term use can lead to dependence, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially worsen colonic issues.  *Explore alternative approaches to bowel management.*  Is the constipation truly refractory to other methods?\n* **Clonidine:**  Known for causing hypotension, which aligns with the dizziness.  Is this still necessary for insomnia? Can the dose be adjusted or alternative treatments explored?\n* **Keppra/Lamictal:**  Both can have side effects that indirectly impact gastrointestinal function or contribute to dizziness.\n* **Magnesium:** While helpful, too much magnesium can cause diarrhea and potentially exacerbate bowel issues.\n* **Drug Interactions:**  Review all medications for potential interactions that could be contributing to her symptoms.\n\n**IV.  What You Need to Communicate to Her Medical Team**\n\n* **Chronological Detail:** Provide a very detailed timeline of her symptoms, from the very beginning (April) including what makes them better or worse.\n* **Severity:**  Emphasize the constant nature of the pain and its impact on her quality of life.  Use the pain scale consistently.\n* **Impact on Functioning:**  She's losing weight and having difficulty with daily activities.  This is not \"just a tummy ache.\" This is significantly affecting her life. \n* **Dizziness/Fall:**  This is a red flag.  Make sure they address this immediately.\n* **Your Concerns:**  Don't be afraid to voice your concerns about a possible bowel obstruction, dehydration, cardiac issues, or medication side effects.\n* **Ask Specific Questions:**  \"What tests are you ordering to rule out a bowel obstruction?\"  \"What is the plan to address the dizziness?\"  \"Can we review her medications to see if we can reduce stimulation?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The complexity of your daughter's medical history requires a comprehensive evaluation by her medical team.  **If her symptoms worsen, or she experiences new symptoms (fever, vomiting, severe abdominal distention, inability to pass gas or stool), seek immediate medical attention.**  You are her advocate, and you need to push for thorough investigation and a plan to address her suffering.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I wish you and your daughter all the best."

        "question": "Not sure if this is allowed- (20F/medical MJ patient/white) I've been trying to get this figured out for YEARS now, no one takes me seriously. Does anyone know about temporal lobe epilepsy? For years I've had severe deja vu (I can literally tell what's going to happen before it does) that is accompanied by severe nausea and head tingling/pressure. The pressure is in the occipital lobe and temples, and it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It'll go on multiple times a day for a week, then disappear for months. I keep logs of what happens during, before and after and how long they last JUST in case. It's not that bad but it really makes me feel like pure shit and like I'm going to die when it happens",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're absolutely right to seek information and advocate for yourself, and it's *very* good you're keeping detailed logs. This is exactly the kind of documentation that can be helpful. And yes, asking about medical conditions here is generally okay, *as long as it's for information and not seeking diagnosis or treatment* (I'll reiterate that disclaimer at the end!). I'm an AI and cannot give medical advice, but I can provide information.  Your description definitely raises flags for possible temporal lobe issues. Here's a breakdown addressing your concerns, and things to consider.  I'll try to be thorough.\n\n**What you're describing sounds *very* consistent with simple partial seizures originating in the temporal lobe. It is absolutely reasonable to investigate this possibility, and you deserve to be taken seriously.**\n\nHere's why, broken down by what you mentioned:\n\n* **Severe Deja Vu (with precognitive feeling):** This is a *classic* aura associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.  The feeling of \"knowing\" what's going to happen is a very common complaint.  It's not actually precognition, but a malfunction in how the brain processes memory and perception. The temporal lobe plays a huge role in both.\n* **Nausea:** Nausea is a very common *associated symptom* (or aura symptom) with temporal lobe seizures. It's not everyone, but it's frequently reported.\n* **Head Tingling/Pressure:**  The location you describe (occipital lobe and temples) is concerning and can certainly be part of a seizure aura.  The pressure sensation is also frequently described. The fact that it's localized is helpful information.\n* **Short Duration (Under 10 minutes):**  While *generalized* seizures can last longer, simple partial seizures (like auras) often *do* last just a few seconds to minutes.  Your timeline is very typical.\n* **Episodic/Clustering:**  The pattern of happening for a week, then disappearing for months is also common.  Seizure patterns can be variable, influenced by factors like stress, sleep, hormones (as a 20F, this is important!), and even weather.\n* **Feeling of Impending Doom/Like You're Going To Die:** This is a very terrifying, and unfortunately common, feeling during auras. It's part of the dysregulation of the limbic system, which the temporal lobe is strongly connected to.\n\n\n\n**Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: A Deeper Dive**\n\nThe temporal lobe is involved in:\n\n*   **Memory:**  This is where deja vu stems from.\n*   **Emotion:**  This explains the anxiety/fear/doom feeling.\n*   **Sensory Processing:**  (smell, taste, sound, vision \u2013 sometimes distortions occur).\n*   **Language:** (less likely to be the source of *your* symptoms, but part of the lobe)\n\n**What causes temporal lobe seizures?**\n\nThere are many possibilities:\n\n*   **Hippocampal Sclerosis:** This is one of the most common causes. It involves scarring in the hippocampus (part of the temporal lobe).\n*   **Brain Injury:**  Even a mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) can sometimes lead to epilepsy years later.\n*   **Infection:**  Encephalitis or meningitis.\n*   **Stroke:**  Even small, seemingly insignificant strokes.\n*   **Genetic Predisposition:**  Sometimes epilepsy runs in families.\n*   **Tumors:** (Less common, but needs to be ruled out)\n* **Developmental Abnormalities:** Problems with brain formation during development.\n* **Idiopathic:**  Sometimes, the cause is unknown.\n\n**Why might doctors be dismissing you (and what to do about it)?**\n\n*   **\"Classic\" Seizure Presentation:**  People often think of epilepsy as dramatic, convulsive seizures. Simple partial seizures (auras) can be much more subtle and easily dismissed.\n*   **Episodic Nature:**  The waxing and waning nature of your symptoms can make it hard to catch something on testing.\n*   **Gender Bias:** Unfortunately, women's health concerns are often taken less seriously.\n*   **Medical Marijuana Use:**  This *can* unfortunately create a bias with some providers, even though it's legally protected in many places.  Some doctors may wrongly attribute your symptoms *to* the marijuana. (You don't need to disclose this if you're not comfortable, but be aware it *could* be a factor.)\n\n\n\n\n**What do you NEED to do? (Action Steps)**\n\n1.  **Neurologist \u2013 and a *good* one:**  This is the *most* important step. You need a neurologist, specifically one with expertise in epilepsy.  Don't be afraid to get a second (or even third) opinion if you're not satisfied. Ask friends, online epilepsy support groups (see resources below), or your primary care doctor for recommendations.\n2.  **Detailed Logs:**  You're already doing this \u2013 *excellent!*  Include:\n    *   **Date & Time:**\n    *   **Precise Description of Symptoms:** (Deja vu? Nausea? Tingling? Where in your head is the pressure?)\n    *   **Duration:** (How long did each symptom last?)\n    *   **Triggers:** (Stressful event? Lack of sleep?  Specific foods?)\n    *   **What You Were Doing:** (e.g., \"Driving,\" \"Reading,\" \"Talking to a friend\")\n    *   **Post-Ictal Symptoms:** (How did you feel *after* the episode?  Confused? Tired? Headache?) This is important!\n3.  **Push for an EEG:**  An electroencephalogram (EEG) is the standard test for epilepsy.  It records brainwave activity. *However,* a single normal EEG doesn't rule out epilepsy.  You may need:\n    *   **Routine EEG:**  A standard test.\n    *   **Prolonged EEG:**  A longer EEG, sometimes done overnight or for 24-72 hours to increase the chances of capturing an event.\n    *  **Video EEG:** The gold standard. This records your brain activity *and* your behavior during an event. This is crucial for capturing what actually happens during your episodes.\n4. **MRI:** An MRI of the brain is often done to look for structural abnormalities (like hippocampal sclerosis or tumors).\n5. **Be Assertive:**  You know your body.  If you feel like something is wrong, keep advocating for yourself.  Bring your logs, explain your symptoms clearly and calmly, and don't let anyone dismiss your concerns.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)  (Excellent resource for information and support.)\n* **NAE (North American Epilepsy Congress):**[https://www.epilepsy.com/nae](https://www.epilepsy.com/nae)\n*   **American Epilepsy Society:** [https://www.aesnet.org/](https://www.aesnet.org/)\n*   **Facebook Epilepsy Support Groups:**  Search for \"Epilepsy Support Group\" on Facebook.  You can connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI Chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous. Diagnosing epilepsy requires a thorough medical evaluation by a neurologist.\n\n\n\nYou are doing the right thing by seeking information.  Don't give up on finding answers and getting the care you deserve.  I truly hope you find a doctor who will listen and help you get to the bottom of this.

        "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this *is* a complex picture and it\u2019s understandable why you\u2019re feeling lost with differing opinions. You\u2019re right to reach out for broader perspectives. Here's a breakdown of analysis, potential avenues to explore, and things to discuss with your doctors.  I will preface this with the **disclaimer that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and you should discuss all concerns with your medical team.**\n\n**Let's break down the symptoms and consider possibilities, categorizing them for clarity:**\n\n**1. Neurological Symptoms (Seizures/Chorea/TD/Unexplained Movements):**\n\n* **The Disagreement:** The fact that your doctors are using different terms (chorea, focal aware seizures, tardive dyskinesia) is important.  They're all *movement disorders*, but have slightly different origins and implications.\n    * **Chorea:**  Often described as jerky, involuntary movements that appear random.  It can be associated with various conditions including autoimmune issues, genetic factors, or medication side effects.\n    * **Focal Aware Seizure:**  Seizure activity originating in a specific part of the brain, where you remain conscious, but experience altered sensations, emotions, or movements.\n    * **Tardive Dyskinesia (TD):**  Usually associated with long-term dopamine-blocking medication (like some antipsychotics, and *sometimes* SSRIs/SNRIs though less common). Your past experience with metaclopramide-induced TD is helpful context, but this *can* present differently.\n* **Important Considerations:**\n    * **Edible Use:** You\u2019ve already pinpointed a crucial correlation. Definitely stop or dramatically reduce edible use immediately, even small doses.  Cannabinoids can affect seizure thresholds and can exacerbate underlying neurological conditions. They can also interact with antidepressants.\n    * **Wellbutrin & Cymbalta:** While you\u2019ve been on them for awhile without issue, it's worth discussing with your psychiatrist whether these could *contribute* to movement issues, especially in the context of your history and other symptoms.  Antidepressants are not entirely without neurological side effects, although rare.\n    * **Video EEG:** If your standard EEG was normal, a *video EEG* is crucial. This records brain activity *during* a movement episode. This can differentiate between a true seizure and other movement disorders. This is something to strongly advocate for.\n    * **MRI of the Brain with and without contrast:**  A CT scan is good for ruling out immediate structural issues, but an MRI provides far more detail and can reveal subtle abnormalities. \n    * **Neurologist Specialist:**  If you haven\u2019t already, see a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. This is *essential*.\n\n**2. Systemic Symptoms (Fatigue, Joint Pain, Mouth Sores, Dry Lips, Low-Grade Fevers):**\n\n* **Lupus Consideration:** Your rheumatologist's suspicion of lupus is reasonable given the combination of symptoms.  Lupus can present very differently in different individuals, and neurological symptoms *are* possible.\n* **Autoimmune Possibilities:**  Beyond Lupus, these symptoms could suggest other autoimmune diseases:\n    * **Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome:**  Often causes dry eyes, dry mouth (explaining your lips), joint pain, and fatigue.\n    * **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Though your rheumatoid factor was normal, early rheumatoid arthritis can be RF-negative. \n    * **Vasculitis:**  Inflammation of blood vessels, which can cause a wide range of symptoms depending on which vessels are affected.\n* **Infections:**  While less likely given normal blood tests so far, certain chronic or low-grade infections can cause systemic symptoms.\n* **Vitamin Deficiencies:** B12, D, and Iron deficiencies can cause fatigue, neurological symptoms and even mouth sores.\n\n**3. Other Symptoms (Hair Loss):**\n\n* **Stress & Depression:**  Hair loss *can* be a symptom of chronic stress and depression, but with the other symptoms present, it shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as solely that. \n* **Autoimmune Related:** Autoimmune diseases can also cause hair loss.\n* **Thyroid Issues:**  Thyroid disorders can cause hair loss and fatigue. If you haven't had a recent thyroid panel, it would be worthwhile.\n\n\n\n**Tests to Push For (Based on Your History & Symptoms):**\n\n* **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody):**  A standard test for autoimmune diseases.\n* **dsDNA (Double-Stranded DNA Antibody):** More specific for Lupus.\n* **C3 & C4:** Complement proteins; often low in active Lupus.\n* **Smith Antibody:** Another test specific to Lupus.\n* **RNP Antibody:** Relevant for Mixed Connective Tissue Disease.\n* **Sj\u00f6gren's Antibodies (SSA/Ro and SSB/La):**  To investigate Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome.\n* **CCP Antibody:**  More sensitive for Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n* **ESR & CRP:** Inflammatory markers (though not always definitive).\n* **Vitamin D, B12, Ferritin, Iron Panel:**  To check for deficiencies.\n* **Thyroid Panel (TSH, Free T4, Free T3):**  To assess thyroid function.\n* **Video EEG:**  As mentioned above, absolutely essential for characterizing the movement episodes.\n* **MRI of the Brain with and without Contrast:** More detailed imaging.\n* **Consider Lyme Disease/Tick-Borne Illness Testing:** Depending on your location and potential exposure.\n\n**Important Things to Communicate to Your Doctors:**\n\n* **Detailed Symptom Timeline:**  Keep a very detailed log of when symptoms started, what makes them better or worse, and any potential triggers (like edibles).\n* **Specifics of Movements:**  Describe the movements as precisely as possible. Are they jerking, twisting, writhing, rhythmic? Which parts of the body are affected?\n* **Impact on Function:**  How are these symptoms affecting your daily life, work, sleep, and mental health?\n* **Edible Use:** Be completely honest about your edible use, even if you\u2019re hesitant.\n* **Prior TD Episode:**  Reinforce the detail that the prior TD was localized to the face and feels *different* from these current episodes.\n* **Your Concerns:**  Don\u2019t hesitate to voice your anxieties and frustrations. Having a collaborative relationship with your doctors is important.\n\n\n\n**To help me potentially refine this further (but remember, I'm not a doctor), could you tell me:**\n\n* **How frequent is your menstrual cycle?** (Helps understand the timing of the low-grade fevers)\n* **What is the specific strain/type of edibles you've used?** (HHC and THC are different, and even within THC there are varying strains)\n* **What other medications (if any) are you taking?**\n* **Are there any family members with autoimmune conditions or neurological issues?**\n\n\n\nYou are being a proactive patient by seeking answers and gathering information. Don't give up!  It may take time and persistence to reach a diagnosis, but it's worth it to get the right treatment and improve your quality of life.  \n\n\n\n"

        "question": "I\u2019m 25 with seizures, been seizure free for about 5 years, I\u2019m on 200mg twice a day medication is lamotrigne, I\u2019m a heavy smoker I\u2019m a female I weigh 139lbs I\u2019m 5\u20196. Can I take shrooms?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really important question, and I'm glad you're asking it.  It's good you're thinking through the potential risks. Here's a detailed breakdown of why combining psilocybin mushrooms (\"shrooms\") with your medical history and current situation is *highly risky* and generally **not recommended**, along with a lot of explanation.  I will cover the interactions, your specific factors, and what you should do instead.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end.**\n\n**The Core Issue: Interactions and Increased Risk**\n\nThe biggest concern is the potential for interaction between psilocybin and lamotrigine (Lamictal), combined with your seizure history and smoking. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Psilocybin and Seizure Threshold:** Psilocybin can lower the seizure threshold. This means it makes it *easier* for a seizure to start.  Even though you've been seizure-free for 5 years, you still have an underlying predisposition to seizures.  Reintroducing something that lowers that threshold is a significant risk.\n* **Lamotrigine & Drug Interactions:** Lamotrigine's metabolism (how your body breaks it down) *can* be affected by other drugs, though the interactions with psilocybin aren't fully studied.  The concern is that psilocybin could potentially alter the levels of lamotrigine in your blood, making it less effective or, rarely, increasing it to potentially toxic levels.  This unpredictability is dangerous.\n* **Serotonin Syndrome (Potential, though less likely):** While less common with psilocybin alone than with combinations like psilocybin + SSRIs/MAOIs, there's a theoretical risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if there's any effect on lamotrigine metabolism. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by too much serotonin in the brain. Symptoms can include agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, muscle rigidity, and seizures.\n* **Smoking:** Smoking (nicotine) has complex effects on seizure threshold.  It can *sometimes* lower it, and it also introduces additional stress on the cardiovascular system, which could be problematic during a psychedelic experience.\n* **Psychological Effects and Anxiety:**  Psilocybin can cause intense emotional and psychological experiences.  If you are prone to anxiety or panic (which can sometimes be exacerbated by smoking), this could potentially trigger a seizure in someone with a seizure disorder, even if indirectly.\n* **Unpredictability:** Psychedelic experiences are inherently unpredictable.  There's no way to know how *you* will react, and the risk is amplified by your medical background.\n\n\n\n**Your Specific Factors \u2013 Why You're at Higher Risk**\n\n* **Seizure History:**  Even 5 years seizure-free, your history significantly increases the risk.  The underlying cause of your seizures hasn't necessarily disappeared.\n* **Lamotrigine Dosage:** 200mg twice a day is a relatively common dose, but it means you *need* that medication to stay stable.  Anything that interferes with its effectiveness is a concern.\n* **Age & Weight:** Your age (25) and weight (139lbs, 5'6\") are generally not *primary* risk factors, but they do influence how drugs are metabolized.\n* **Smoking (Heavy):** This adds another layer of complexity and potential risk, as mentioned above.\n\n\n\n**Why Even \"Small\" Amounts Are Risky**\n\nPeople sometimes think a small dose (\"microdose\") would be okay. That's *still* potentially dangerous in your case. Even low doses of psilocybin can:\n\n*   Slightly lower seizure threshold.\n*   Have unpredictable effects on lamotrigine levels.\n*   Cause anxiety or psychological distress that could be a trigger.\n\n\n\n**What *Should* You Do?**\n\n1. **Absolutely Talk to Your Neurologist:** This is the *most important* step.  Do *not* use psilocybin without a frank and open discussion with the doctor who manages your seizures.  They know your specific condition, your medication, and your overall health best.  They can give you personalized advice.  Be honest about your smoking as well.  They will likely strongly advise *against* it.\n2. **Consider Alternatives (With Professional Guidance):** If you're interested in the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics, explore *legal* and *medically supervised* options.  There's growing research into psilocybin-assisted therapy for conditions like depression and anxiety, but these are done in controlled clinical settings with careful patient selection and medical monitoring.  *These are not the same as recreational use.*\n3. **Focus on Seizure Management:** Continue taking your lamotrigine as prescribed and follow up with your neurologist regularly.  Prioritize your health and stability.\n4. **Address Smoking:**  If you're open to it, consider quitting smoking. It has numerous health benefits, including potentially reducing stress on your nervous system.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Self-treating can be very harmful.

        "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy\u2014frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* complex and concerning presentation. You're right to be pushing for answers, and it's frustrating that testing has been largely unremarkable so far. Let's break down the issues (epilepsy and osteoporosis/fractures) and explore potential, less-common, and potentially overlooked avenues.  I'm going to give a lot of information, it's meant to be a comprehensive thought process, *not* a self-diagnosis guide. **This is not a substitute for medical advice, and you *must* continue working closely with your medical team.**  I\u2019ll also categorize thoughts by likelihood/how strongly I think they should be considered given your history.\n\n**First: The Interplay - Epilepsy & Osteoporosis?**\n\nThis is the crucial connection. It's not often the first thing considered, but increasingly, there's recognition of a strong link between neurological conditions, especially epilepsy, and bone health.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n* **Seizure-Related Falls:** Even focal aware seizures can cause subtle disruptions in balance and coordination, potentially leading to falls, even ones you don't fully remember. Frequent, even subtle, impacts *could* contribute to fractures, though you\u2019ve specified these happen *in sleep*. This still makes me think about it though.\n* **Neurological Effects on Bone Metabolism:** The brain and the endocrine system (which regulates bone health) are intimately connected.  The chronic firing of neurons in epilepsy, especially focal onset, can potentially disrupt hormonal regulation.  Specifically, it might affect:\n    * **Cortisol:** Chronic stress from seizures can elevate cortisol, which negatively impacts bone formation.\n    * **Vitamin D Metabolism:**  The brain plays a role in Vitamin D activation.  Seizures could conceivably interfere with this.\n    * **Gonadal Hormones (Testosterone/Estrogen):**  While you're male and presumably have normal testosterone, seizure activity *can* influence hormone production.\n* **Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs):** While you haven't mentioned specific AEDs (and it's good you clarified that Lexapro is your only medication), many AEDs *are* known to interfere with Vitamin D metabolism and bone density. Even if you aren't *currently* taking an AED, prior brief trials that weren't continued could have had a temporary negative impact.\n\n**Second:  Diving Deeper into the \"Normal\" Labs - What Might Be Missed?**\n\nYou say labs are mostly normal, but \"normal\" is a range, and subtle abnormalities can be significant. Here's what to push for, if not already done:\n\n* **Advanced Vitamin D:** Don't just check 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Check:\n    * **1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (Calcitriol):**  This is the active form.  Low levels can indicate a problem with activation.\n    * **Vitamin D Binding Protein (VDBP):**  Deficiencies here can mean vitamin D isn\u2019t being transported effectively.\n* **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) & Calcium Metabolism - Exhaustive:**\n    * **PTH, Ionized Calcium, Albumin-Corrected Calcium:** Multiple measurements, as PTH is pulsatile.\n    * **Magnesium:** Often overlooked, essential for PTH and Vitamin D function.\n    * **Phosphate:** Important in calcium regulation.\n    * **Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23):** A key regulator of phosphate and Vitamin D.  Elevated levels can suggest kidney issues or a problem with phosphate handling.\n* **Bone Turnover Markers:**  These give insight into how quickly bone is being broken down and rebuilt.  Examples:\n    * **Serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX)**: Bone resorption marker.\n    * **Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP)**: Bone formation marker.\n* **Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP) - Repeated:** Subtle changes in kidney or liver function can impact bone health.\n* **Celiac Disease Screening:**  Even without GI symptoms, celiac can cause malabsorption of nutrients vital for bone health (calcium, vitamin D, etc.).  Includes tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA and IgA levels to rule out IgA deficiency.\n* **Inflammatory Markers:** ESR and CRP (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein).  Underlying, low-grade inflammation can affect bone.\n* **Genetic Testing:**  Though you have no family history, *de novo* (new) genetic mutations can occur. Specifically, look for genes related to:\n    * **Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI):** Though usually presenting earlier, milder forms can be missed.\n    * **Rare Bone Disorders:** There are many rare genetic conditions that can cause low bone density and fractures.\n* **Bone Marrow Biopsy (less likely, but consider if other tests are negative):** This is invasive and usually reserved for suspected bone marrow disorders, but could help rule out things like multiple myeloma (though unlikely at your age).\n\n**Third: Investigating the Seizures Further - Beyond Basic EEG/MRI**\n\n* **Video-EEG Monitoring (Prolonged):**  If not done already, a longer period of monitoring (several days) can capture more subtle seizure activity, even if you don't *feel* a full seizure.  This is crucial.\n* **fMRI During Seizure Activity:** If possible, functional MRI during a seizure can pinpoint the exact brain region involved and potentially show its impact on regulatory areas.\n* **Consider other seizure types:**  Are you *absolutely* sure these are focal aware?  Sometimes, subtle automatisms or behavioral changes can occur without full loss of consciousness.\n\n\n\n**Fourth: Specific Considerations Given Your Profile**\n\n* **Lexapro:** While generally not directly linked to osteoporosis, SSRIs can *slightly* increase fracture risk in some individuals.  It's unlikely to be the primary culprit, but it\u2019s worth noting.\n* **Low Body Weight:** You're at the lower end of the weight range for your height.  Low weight can contribute to lower bone density. It's important to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake, *especially* while trying to address the bone issue.\n* **Physical Activity (Jogging):** While generally good, high-impact activity *repetitively* can cause stress fractures, though usually localized to the bones impacted. Given your widespread fractures, this is less likely to be the primary driver, but it's a factor.\n* **Spontaneous Fractures in Sleep:** This is *extremely* unusual.  This fact points strongly towards a systemic issue, rather than just localized weakness.\n\n\n\n**Action Steps & Communication with your Doctors:**\n\n1. **Compile a detailed timeline:**  When did the first fracture occur? What was the progression of seizures? When were medications started/stopped?\n2. **Advocate for further testing:**  Specifically request the advanced Vitamin D panel, bone turnover markers, FGF23, and celiac screening.  Discuss genetic testing if other avenues are exhausted.\n3. **Neurology/Endocrinology Collaboration:**  Ensure your neurologist and endocrinologist are actively communicating.  The link between seizures and bone health needs to be addressed.\n4. **Second Opinions:**  Don\u2019t hesitate to seek a second opinion from a specialist in metabolic bone disease (an endocrinologist specializing in bone disorders).\n\n**In summary:** Your case is complex and requires a meticulous, multi-disciplinary approach. The potential connection between your epilepsy and osteoporosis is the most important area to investigate. Don\u2019t accept \u201cnormal\u201d labs as the end of the road \u2013 push for more in-depth investigations, and advocate for collaboration between your specialists. I wish you the best in finding answers and improving your health.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* understandably anxious situation. A first-time seizure in a teenager is always concerning, and combining that with a planned trip to a remote location adds a lot of stress. Let's break down the medical perspective, risks, and things to consider to help you make the best decision.  I will preface this with a **disclaimer at the end** as I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n* **First Seizure:** A single seizure doesn't automatically mean epilepsy. There are many possible causes for a first-time seizure, including:\n    * **Febrile Seizure (less likely at 15):**  Usually happens with high fever, but sometimes can be atypical.\n    * **Idiopathic:**  Meaning the cause is unknown, and it may never happen again.\n    * **Provoked Seizures:**  Triggered by things like sleep deprivation, stress, dehydration, flashing lights, or, rarely, substance use (though you noted no pre-existing conditions, it's worth keeping in mind).\n    * **Underlying Medical Condition:**  This is what the paediatrician will be investigating - could be structural (like an undetected abnormality), metabolic, genetic, or infectious.\n* **Absence Moments:** These are important to tell the paediatrician. Absent moments *could* be partial (focal) seizures, or something completely separate.  Their connection (or lack thereof) to the tonic-clonic seizure is vital to understand.\n* **Deviated Septum:**  Generally, a deviated septum itself is unlikely to *cause* seizures. However, severe sleep disruption from it *could* theoretically contribute (due to sleep deprivation).\n* **Remote Location:**  30 minutes to the nearest hospital *is* a consideration.  A tonic-clonic seizure requires observation and potentially treatment, and a longer transport time isn\u2019t ideal.\n\n\n\n**Should You Cancel the Trip?  A Risk-Benefit Analysis**\n\nThis is the core of your question, and there's no simple answer. Here's a structured way to think about it:\n\n**Arguments for Cancelling/Postponing:**\n\n* **Uncertainty:** You have *no diagnosis*.  You don't know the cause of the seizure.  This means you don\u2019t know the risk of another one, and you don't know if there's a treatable underlying condition that needs immediate attention.\n* **Potential for Complications:**  A seizure, especially in an unfamiliar environment, can be frightening and lead to injury.  While typically not life-threatening, there are risks.\n* **Accessibility of Care:**  30 minutes to a hospital *feels* like a long time when someone is actively seizing.  Delays in getting medical attention *could* be problematic depending on the cause.\n* **Your Anxiety:** Your anxiety is valid!  Being constantly worried will severely impact your ability to enjoy the trip, and it could even impact your son's well-being.  A stressed parent isn't as able to respond effectively in an emergency.\n\n**Arguments for Going (With Significant Precautions \u2013 see below):**\n\n* **The Chance it's a One-Off:**  Many people have a single seizure and never have another.\n* **The Paediatrician Has Been Contacted:** You've started the diagnostic process, which is excellent.\n* **Potential for Stress Reduction:**  A vacation *could* be beneficial if your son isn't actively at risk provided that you are able to relax.\n\n\n\n\n**If You *Do* Decide to Go (Assuming you haven\u2019t had the paediatrician appointment before then \u2013 if you have, follow their advice!):**\n\nThis requires *very* careful planning and a realistic assessment of your ability to handle a situation.\n\n1. **Talk to Your GP/Family Doctor Now:**  Even *before* the paediatrician appointment, see if your GP can offer any immediate advice or reassurance.  Explain the travel plans.  They might be able to offer some basic guidance.\n2. **Seizure Action Plan (Even Without a Diagnosis):**  Discuss with a medical professional (GP if not the paediatrician) what to do *if* a seizure happens.  This should include:\n    * **Safety First:** How to protect your son from injury during a seizure (clear space, cushion head).\n    * **Timing:**  How long to time the seizure.\n    * **When to Call for Help:** This is crucial. As a general rule, call emergency services (112 in Europe) if:\n        * The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.\n        * He has one seizure immediately after another without regaining consciousness between them.\n        * He is injured during the seizure.\n        * He has difficulty breathing after the seizure stops.\n        * This is his second seizure.\n    * **What to tell emergency services:** Be prepared to describe the seizure accurately (what you saw).\n3. **Travel Insurance:**  Ensure your travel insurance covers medical emergencies *including* seizures and potential hospitalization. Verify coverage for repatriation if necessary.\n4. **Medication (Even Without a Prescription):**  Discuss with your doctor whether it\u2019s reasonable to carry any over-the-counter medications that *might* be helpful for possible triggers (e.g., anti-nausea medication if travel sickness is a concern).  *Do not* attempt to self-treat with anything not recommended by a doctor.\n5. **Environmental Considerations:**\n    * **Sleep:**  Ensure your son is getting enough sleep.  (Address the deviated septum if it\u2019s affecting sleep.)\n    * **Hydration:**  Keep him well-hydrated, especially in warmer climates.\n    * **Stress:**  Minimize stress as much as possible.\n    * **Avoidance of Known Triggers:** If you can identify any potential triggers (e.g., flashing lights, excessive alcohol - obviously not relevant for a 15-year-old), avoid them.\n6. **Inform Others:** Tell anyone you're traveling with about the seizure and the action plan.\n7. **Hospital Information:** Have the address and phone number of the nearest hospital readily available. Learn how to describe your location if you need to call for help.\n\n**My Constructive Opinion:**\n\nGiven the newness of the situation and the lack of a diagnosis, **I would lean towards postponing the trip** if possible.  The peace of mind of being closer to medical care, and having a clearer understanding of what's going on, outweighs the potential benefits of the vacation at this point.  \n\n*However*, if postponing is truly not an option, then **go only with *extremely* careful preparation** as outlined above.  You need to feel confident in your ability to respond in an emergency, and you need to be prepared for the possibility that the trip might be cut short if another seizure occurs.\n\n**Most Importantly:** Trust your gut. You know your son best.\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably causing you anxiety, even if you suspect it's likely benign.  It's good you're being proactive and trying to understand what might be happening while you wait for your doctor's follow-up.  Let's break down the likely next steps, potential causes beyond UTI/kidney stones, and how your medications might *potentially* play a role (though seemingly less likely given the timing of the first test).  I will add a **disclaimer at the end** as this is not medical advice.\n\n**Understanding the Results: 25 RBC/uL**\n\n25 RBC/uL *is* considered microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine).  While a single instance can be a lab error or temporary, *two* instances at the same level, especially several weeks apart, warrant investigation. It *does not* automatically mean something serious, but it requires finding the source.  Your doctor is right to want to investigate further.\n\n**Likely Next Steps (What your doctor will likely do in a few weeks):**\n\n1. **Repeat Urinalysis with Culture:**  Even though the initial tests didn't show signs of infection, they will likely repeat this to absolutely rule out a UTI, especially if you develop any symptoms in the meantime.  A culture specifically looks for bacteria.  Sometimes UTIs are low-grade or atypical.\n2. **Imaging Studies:** This is the most probable next step.  Expect one or more of these:\n    *   **CT Scan (without contrast):** This is often the first-line imaging for hematuria. It's good at detecting kidney stones, tumors, and other structural abnormalities. *The \"without contrast\" part is often used first to minimize kidney risk, especially given your medical history.*\n    *   **Ultrasound of the Kidneys and Bladder:**  This is a non-invasive option, and good for visualizing the kidneys, collecting system, and bladder.  It's less sensitive than a CT scan for small stones but doesn't involve radiation.\n    * **Cystoscopy:**  Less likely as a first step, but possible. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into the bladder to directly visualize the bladder lining. It's useful for looking for bladder tumors or other abnormalities.\n3. **Blood Tests:** They might run additional blood tests to assess kidney function (BUN, creatinine), and potentially look for clotting disorders, although these are less common causes in your age group.\n4. **Detailed Medical History and Physical Exam:** Your doctor will ask detailed questions about your symptoms (even though you currently have none), family history of kidney disease or bleeding disorders, and review your medication list again. A physical exam will also be performed.\n\n**Potential Causes of Hematuria *Beyond* UTI and Kidney Stones (especially in someone your age with no other symptoms):**\n\n*   **Glomerular Hematuria:** This is where blood leaks from the glomeruli (filtering units in the kidneys).  Can be caused by:\n    *   **IgA Nephropathy:** A common cause, especially after an upper respiratory infection. Symptoms aren't always present.\n    *   **Thin Basement Membrane Disease:**  A genetic condition where the filtering membranes are thin and can leak. Often benign and doesn't cause problems.\n    *   **Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS):**  A less common cause, but more serious.\n*   **Exercise-Induced Hematuria:**  Strenuous exercise can sometimes temporarily cause blood in the urine.\n*   **Trauma:** Even minor trauma you might not remember.\n*   **Medications:** (*see section below*)\n*   **Benign Familial Hematuria:**  A rare, inherited condition where people consistently have microscopic blood in their urine without any underlying kidney disease.\n*  **Bladder Irritation:** Interstitial cystitis, or inflammation of the bladder, can cause microscopic hematuria.\n*   **Very Rarely \u2013 Tumors:**  While less likely at your age, bladder or kidney tumors *can* present with hematuria. This is why investigation is important.\n\n\n\n**How Might Your Medications Play a Role?**\n\n*   **Lithium:** Lithium *can* cause kidney problems (nephrotoxicity) over time, but this is usually associated with long-term use and often affects kidney *function* (showing up in your BUN and creatinine levels) before causing blood in the urine. Since the first urinalysis was *before* starting lithium, it's less likely the cause of the initial finding. However, it's vital your kidney function is closely monitored while on lithium, and the hematuria will add to that concern.\n*   **Lamictal (Lamotrigine):**  Rarely, Lamictal has been associated with kidney problems, including hematuria, but this is uncommon.\n*   **Buspirone:**  Buspirone is not typically associated with kidney issues or hematuria.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Can Do While You Wait:**\n\n*   **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water. This helps dilute your urine and may help flush out any small stones.\n*   **Monitor Symptoms:**  Pay close attention to your body.  Note any changes in urine color (even slight), pain in your back or flank, increased frequency or urgency of urination, fever, or any other new symptoms.\n*   **Keep a Symptom Diary:**  Write down any symptoms, even mild ones. Also, record your fluid intake and any strenuous activities you engage in.\n*   **Avoid NSAIDs:**  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like ibuprofen or naproxen) can sometimes worsen kidney problems and might interfere with the investigation.  Talk to your doctor before taking them.\n*   **Don\u2019t Panic:**  As you've rightly said, it's likely benign, *especially* given your age.  The fact that you're seeking answers and being proactive is great.\n\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds *very* concerning, and I'm glad you're thinking about what happened and trying to understand it. While I absolutely *cannot* diagnose you (I'm an AI and not a medical professional!), and it's good you were checked for epilepsy before, what you describe definitely warrants a **prompt medical evaluation.**  Here's a breakdown of why, considering your history, the symptoms, and the potential (but not definite!) connection to epilepsy, along with other possibilities.  I'll also address the hormone medication.  I'll finish with very strong advice on what you need to do.\n\n**Why this is concerning and why you need to see a doctor ASAP:**\n\n* **New-Onset Symptoms:** You're describing a significant and frightening episode with multiple symptoms. Even though you had a negative epilepsy test at 15, epilepsy *can* develop any time in life.  A negative test then doesn't rule it out *forever*.\n* **Trigger:**  Bright, flashing lights are a known trigger for seizures in some types of epilepsy (photosensitive epilepsy). The timing is suggestive.\n* **Symptoms:** The combination of shaking, vomiting, dizziness, coldness, numbness, and changes in heart rate and blood pressure are *not* typical of a simple migraine or dehydration.  They point to something more systemic affecting the nervous system.\n* **Duration:** Five hours is a *long* time for many conditions. Persistent symptoms like this are especially worrying.\n* **Hormonal Considerations:** You mention hormone issues and taking Normocis. Hormone imbalances *can* sometimes lower the seizure threshold  (make seizures more likely) in susceptible individuals, *and* can interact with certain medications.\n* **The \"Shaking\" - Important Detail:** The nature of the shaking is crucial. Was it rhythmic jerking (convulsions)?  Was it more of a trembling?  Were you conscious during the shaking?  Did you lose control of your bladder or bowel? These are all things a doctor will need to know.\n\n\n\n**Could it be epilepsy? (Possible, but needs investigation)**\n\nPhotosensitive epilepsy is a real thing, and the flashing lights could definitely have triggered a seizure, even if you previously tested negative. However, it's crucial to understand epilepsy isn't the *only* possibility. Here's a broader look:\n\n* **Types of Seizures:**  Epileptic seizures manifest differently.  What you experienced *could* be a complex partial seizure (where you're aware but experiencing altered sensations and possibly brief involuntary movements) that progressed, or a generalized seizure. \n* **Not all shaking is a seizure:** Tremors, caused by other neurological or metabolic issues, can also cause shaking.\n* **Atypical seizures:** Some seizure-like events aren't technically epilepsy, but are caused by other conditions like migraines.\n\n\n\n**Other Possibilities (Beyond Epilepsy):**\n\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines have neurological symptoms *before* the headache, including visual disturbances, dizziness, and even weakness. However, vomiting for 5 hours is less typical of a migraine.\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure that can cause fainting, dizziness, nausea, and sometimes shaking.  However, the duration is longer than typical for vasovagal syncope.  It can be triggered by stress, pain, or sometimes visual stimuli.\n* **Inner Ear Problems (Vestibular Issues):**  Problems with the inner ear can cause dizziness, nausea, and imbalance.  But shaking isn't a common symptom.\n* **Metabolic Issues:**  Occasionally, severe imbalances in electrolytes (sodium, potassium, etc.) can cause neurological symptoms.\n* **Neurological Condition (Other than Epilepsy):**  There are other, rarer neurological conditions that could cause similar symptoms.\n* **Adverse Reaction/Interaction:** While less likely, it is important to consider whether the symptoms could have been caused by the Normocis interacting with something else, or being an adverse reaction to something you ate or were exposed to. The timing, however, makes the flashing lights a more prominent suspect.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding Normocis (and Hormonal Issues):**\n\n* **Drug Interactions:** You *must* tell your doctor about the Normocis.  Some medications can interact with anti-hormonal drugs and potentially affect brain activity or seizure thresholds.\n* **Hormonal Fluctuations:** Hormonal imbalances themselves can, in some cases, contribute to neurological symptoms, or lower the seizure threshold.\n\n\n\n\n**What You *Need* To Do \u2013 VERY IMPORTANT:**\n\n1. **SEE A DOCTOR *IMMEDIATELY*.** Do not wait. This isn't something to try to manage on your own.  A general practitioner (GP) is a good first step, but they may refer you to a neurologist.  If you feel symptoms returning *right now*, go to the emergency room.\n2. **Detailed Account:** When you see the doctor, be prepared to provide a very detailed account of what happened, including:\n    * **Exactly what you were exposed to:** Describe the lights \u2013 were they strobing, rapidly changing colors, intensely bright?\n    * **The sequence of events:**  What happened *immediately* after the light exposure? What came first: the shaking, the dizziness, the nausea?\n    * **Describe the shaking:** Rhythmic jerking? Trembling? What parts of your body were affected?\n    * **Your level of consciousness:** Were you aware of what was happening?  Could you speak?  Did you lose control of your bladder or bowels?\n    * **What helped (or didn't help):** The tea and ferments were good for your stomach, but did they affect the other symptoms?\n    * **Your medical history:**  Tell them about your aunt's epilepsy, your hormone problems, and the Normocis.  List *all* medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you take.\n3. **Consider a Video Recording (If Possible):** If you start experiencing similar symptoms again, and it is safe to do so, have someone record a video of the episode. This can be incredibly helpful for diagnosis.\n4. **Follow-Up Testing:** The doctor will likely order tests, which could include:\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To measure electrical activity in your brain.\n    * **Neuroimaging (MRI or CT Scan):** To look for structural abnormalities in the brain.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To check for metabolic imbalances, hormone levels, and other potential causes.\n\n\n\n\n**Do not try to self-diagnose.  This is a medical issue that needs professional attention.**  I hope you feel better soon, and that you get the answers and care you need.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\nOkay, this is a *lot* to unpack, and you're right to be terrified. It sounds like you're facing a really complex and frightening situation.  I'm going to break down your concerns, but **please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and you *absolutely* need to continue working closely with your medical team.**  This response will be lengthy, but it aims to be thorough.\n\n**1. Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures?**\n\nYes, uncontrolled seizures *can* shorten lifespan. The longer seizures go uncontrolled, and especially if they lead to events like aspiration (like you experienced), injury, or status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure or series of seizures without recovery in between), the greater the risk. Frequent seizures also put a strain on the body over time.  However, that doesn't mean a dramatically shortened lifespan is inevitable.  It underscores *how crucial* it is to get these seizures better controlled.  Your history of running outside naked and the recent aspiration demonstrate the significant danger these uncontrolled events pose.\n\n**2. Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery?**\n\nThis is a crucial question, and it *requires* a detailed evaluation by a neurosurgeon specializing in Chiari malformations. Here's what they will consider:\n\n* **Your Chiari 1 Malformation:** The severity of the malformation itself.  How far down is the cerebellar tonsils descending?\n* **Syrinx:** The size and location of your syrinx are very important. Is it growing? Is it causing neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, etc.)?  Sometimes, decompression surgery can help stabilize or even reduce a syrinx, though it isn't guaranteed.\n* **Your Symptoms:**  Specifically, the relationship between your Chiari, the syrinx, and your seizures.  This is the big question.  Chiari malformations *can* sometimes contribute to epilepsy, but it\u2019s not a direct, guaranteed link.\n* **MRI Imaging:**  High-quality MRI scans are essential to assess everything.\n* **Neurological Examination:** A thorough exam by the neurosurgeon.\n\n**Not everyone with a Chiari 1 is a surgical candidate.** Surgery is usually considered when the malformation is causing significant symptoms that are not responding to other treatments.  The neurosurgeon will weigh the potential benefits of surgery against the risks (infection, complications with the spinal cord or meninges, failure of the surgery to alleviate symptoms, even new neurological problems).\n\n**3. Can spinal decompression surgery possibly control the epilepsy?**\n\nThis is the million-dollar question.  *Potentially, yes, but it is not guaranteed.* The connection between Chiari malformations and epilepsy is complex and not fully understood. The theory is that the Chiari malformation can cause compression or distortion of brain structures or pathways involved in seizure control. \n\n* **If the seizures are *directly* caused by the Chiari/syringomyelia and the surgery successfully alleviates the compression/distortion, there's a chance the seizures could decrease in frequency or even stop.**\n* **However, it's equally possible that your epilepsy has a separate cause, and the surgery won't have any effect.** The fact that your seizures have been ongoing for a decade, even *before* significant progression of the syrinx (if that's the case), suggests a separate etiology.\n* **It's also possible that your seizures could *remain unchanged* even after successful decompression.**\n\nThe neurosurgeon will likely discuss the possibility of doing an EEG *before* and *after* surgery to see if there are any changes in your brain activity.  \n\n**4. How much should I worry about SUDEP?**\n\nSUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is a very serious concern with uncontrolled seizures. Having frequent, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, like yours, increases the risk.  You are absolutely right to be aware of this.  \n\nHere's what increases SUDEP risk:\n\n* **Uncontrolled seizures:**  Your biggest risk factor.\n* **Generalized tonic-clonic seizures:** These are more strongly linked to SUDEP than focal seizures.\n* **Cluster seizures:**  Multiple seizures close together further increase risk.\n* **Nighttime seizures:** Seizures that happen while you're sleeping.\n* **Comorbid conditions:** Your Chiari and syrinx, and potentially any other underlying health issues.\n\n**What can you do to reduce your risk?**\n\n* **Aggressive seizure control:** This is the priority.  Keep working with your neurologist to try different medications or explore other treatment options (see below).\n* **Seizure safety plan:** Discuss with your neurologist and loved ones (when your husband is able) a plan for what to do during a seizure.  This includes positioning, protecting your head, and knowing when to call for emergency help.\n* **Avoid seizure triggers:** If you identify any triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol, etc.), do your best to avoid them.\n* **Consider a bed sensor alarm:** These devices can alert a caregiver if you are having a prolonged seizure while sleeping.\n* **Regular check-ups:**  Stay on top of your medical appointments.\n\n**5. What do I do now?**\n\nThis is the most important part. Here's a plan of action:\n\n* **Neurology Re-evaluation:**  You need a very thorough re-evaluation by a neurologist specializing in epilepsy.  Ideally, an epileptologist (a neurologist with specialized training in epilepsy).  Bring all your medical records and a detailed seizure diary. \n    * **Medication Review:** Discuss all your current medications and their effectiveness (or lack thereof).  Explore other medication options.  There are many anti-epileptic drugs available.\n    * **Further Testing:**  Consider further testing, such as:\n        * **Long-term EEG monitoring:** To capture seizures and pinpoint their origin more accurately.\n        * **MRI with epilepsy protocol:** A specialized MRI designed to look for subtle brain abnormalities. \n        * **Neuropsychological testing:** To assess cognitive function.\n* **Neurosurgeon Consultation:** Schedule a consultation with a neurosurgeon experienced in Chiari malformations and syringomyelia.  Bring your MRI scans and neurology reports.  Be prepared to discuss the potential benefits and risks of surgery.\n* **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Get second opinions.  You are the expert on your own body.\n* **Mental Health Support:** You are understandably terrified. Seek out therapy or counseling to help you cope with the stress and anxiety.  This situation is incredibly challenging, and you deserve support.\n* **Husband's Care:**  While your husband is hospitalized, maintain communication as much as possible.  Include him in medical decisions when appropriate.\n* **Emergency Plan:** Prepare a clear, written emergency plan for seizures, including contact information for medical professionals and loved ones. Keep it readily available.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "i\u2019m currently living with my mom 60F who has had epilepsy for the past 30-ish years. i\u2019ve noticed her memory is declining, especially in the past year or so. it\u2019s not to the point where there could be any sort of formal diagnosis given but it\u2019s starting to concern me. i\u2019ve done some research into the correlation between epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s (or dementia in general) and from what i\u2019ve gathered the strongest correlation is between focal epilepsy and alzheimer\u2019s due to the damage to the temporal lobe. my mom has tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) and i\u2019ve been trying to find information on how much her seizures affect the temporal lobe, but i can\u2019t find much and i think that\u2019s partially due to the lack of research. i don\u2019t know who to ask or talk to about this. i don\u2019t want to scare my mom but i\u2019ve scoured google trying to find more information but i can\u2019t seem to find anything. i just have so many questions\u2026is 60 too early to tell? once her memory starts to decline, how long does she have still being lucid? do grand mal seizures damage the temporal lobe in the same way focal seizures do? if that is what\u2019s happening, how do i make her feel loved and comfortable? examples of her memory issues: forgetting what she\u2019s talking about mid sentence (a lot). forgetting the names of people/places/things that she knows well. misplacing/forgetting objects fairly frequently, etc. i don\u2019t except anyone to know all the answers, but any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.EDIT: i understand with age there\u2019s usually going to be some forgetfulness, but this seems excessive to me. i\u2019m obviously not a professional, just a paranoid daughter, but my father is older and his memory is far better. also, more background: 60F, 5\u20192, 120lbs, past history of estrogen binding cancer (has had double mastectomy + hysterectomy); she fractured her neck following a seizure in 2017? i\u2019m not sure which vertebre, but she\u2019s made a full recovery. also she\u2019s had her left? hip replaced and currently suffers with nerve pain. on my maternal side, there\u2019s a lot of history of mental illness (including: BP-1 & 2, schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, major depression, BPD, ASPD, anxiety & panic disorders & some substance abuse - mostly heroin and meth) my mom is only formally diagnosed with clinical depression, and is on medication for both the epilepsy as well as depression. medications include lexapro & lamotrigine (she also briefly was using \"speed\" which she swears wasn\u2019t meth but there\u2019s a good chance it was)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot, and it\u2019s completely understandable why you\u2019re feeling anxious and overwhelmed. You're right to be proactive and try to gather information, and good on you for recognizing that something feels \"off\" beyond typical age-related forgetfulness. Let's break down your concerns and look at how to approach them.  I'll try to address your questions as thoroughly as I can, but please remember **I am not a medical professional.** This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.\n\n**1. Epilepsy, Alzheimer's/Dementia, and the Temporal Lobe:**\n\nYou are spot on about the link. The strongest connection between epilepsy and dementia is indeed with *temporal lobe epilepsy*. The temporal lobe plays a critical role in memory formation. However, the connection isn't simply *having epilepsy* causes dementia. It's more complex.\n\n* **Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal) Seizures and Temporal Lobe Impact:** You're right, there's less research specifically on the impact of generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the temporal lobe compared to focal seizures. However, *any* seizure activity, even generalized, can have subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) effects on brain function over time. Repeated seizures can cause microscopic damage and disrupt neuronal networks. The impact depends on seizure frequency, severity, age of onset, and individual brain resilience.  The neck fracture from 2017 is a significant point, as head trauma can increase the risk of later cognitive decline. \n* **The Damage Isn\u2019t Always Obvious:** The damage isn\u2019t always a clear \u201clesion\u201d on an MRI. It can be more diffuse, affecting the connections between brain cells.\n* **Not Everyone with Epilepsy will Develop Dementia:** It\u2019s crucial to understand that most people with epilepsy do *not* develop dementia. But the increased risk is there, particularly with long-duration epilepsy.\n* **Other Factors:** Your mom's history of cancer, hip replacement, nerve pain, and particularly, the *mental health history* significantly complicate things. These all contribute to overall health and can impact cognitive function.\n\n**2. Is 60 Too Early to Tell?**\n\nSixty is on the younger side for *typical* Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but not unheard of (especially with contributing factors). \"Early-onset\" Alzheimer's is generally defined as before age 65. What's happening with your mom could be a number of things:\n\n* **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):**  This is a stage between normal age-related decline and dementia. Symptoms are noticeable but don\u2019t severely interfere with daily life.\n* **Vascular Cognitive Impairment:**  This is caused by problems with blood flow to the brain, and can be linked to conditions like high blood pressure (keep an eye on her health metrics)\n* **Depression:**  Severe or chronic depression can *mimic* cognitive decline.  This is very important given her history.\n* **Medication Side Effects:**  Both Lexapro and Lamotrigine can have cognitive side effects, though these are usually mild.\n* **Early Stages of Dementia:** It\u2019s possible, although harder to determine without a thorough evaluation.\n\n**3. How Long After Memory Decline Until Loss of Lucidity?**\n\nThis is extremely variable.  There's no set timeline.  It can range from years to months.  Early stages can be frustrating for both the person and family as they realize something is changing but still maintain a good deal of independence. As it progresses, help with daily tasks becomes necessary.\n\n**4. What to Do Now \u2013 Actionable Steps:**\n\nThis is the most important part.\n\n* **Talk to Her Doctor (and Go *With* Her!):**  This is the crucial first step. A general practitioner is a good starting point, but ideally, you want a referral to:\n    * **Neurologist:**  Specializes in brain disorders, including epilepsy and dementia.\n    * **Geriatrician:**  A doctor specializing in the care of older adults. They are very attuned to the complexities of aging and cognitive changes.\n    * **Neuropsychologist:**  Can administer comprehensive cognitive testing to assess memory, attention, language, and other brain functions.  This can help determine the *type* of cognitive impairment, if any.\n* **Be Specific with the Doctor:** Don\u2019t just say \u201cher memory is bad.\u201d  Write down specific examples beforehand: \"She forgot her best friend's name yesterday,\" \"She was making dinner and forgot why she was in the kitchen,\" \"She's repeated the same question three times in an hour.\" These details are invaluable.  Mention the neck fracture and the history of possible drug use.\n* **Medication Review:** Ask the doctor to review all of her medications to rule out any contributing side effects.  Be upfront about the past \u201cspeed\u201d use, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n* **Brain Imaging:**  The doctor may order an MRI of the brain to look for structural changes (like lesions) or signs of vascular damage.\n* **Blood Tests:**  To rule out other causes of cognitive impairment (vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, etc.).\n* **Address Depression:** Ensure her depression is well-managed.  Sometimes, improving mood can improve cognitive function.\n\n**5. Making Her Feel Loved and Comfortable:**\n\nThis is huge.  Regardless of the cause of the changes, your support will be essential.\n\n* **Patience and Understanding:**  The forgetting is not intentional.  Don\u2019t correct her constantly or make her feel silly.\n* **Reassure Her:**  Let her know you're there for her and that you love her.\n* **Simplify Things:**  Reduce clutter in her environment. Help her establish routines.  Use reminders (lists, calendars, alarms).\n* **Focus on What She Can Still Do:** Encourage activities she enjoys and can still participate in successfully.\n* **Meaningful Activities:** Engage her in activities that have emotional significance \u2013 looking at old photos, listening to her favorite music, sharing stories.\n* **Accept Help:**  Don't try to do everything yourself.  Lean on other family members, friends, or consider respite care.\n\n\n\n**Regarding your concerns about being \u201cparanoid\u201d:**  It\u2019s better to be proactive and express your concerns than to ignore them.  You're a loving daughter who is paying attention, and that's a positive thing.  \n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Alzheimer's Association:** [https://www.alz.org/](https://www.alz.org/)\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **National Institute on Aging:** [https://www.nia.nih.gov/](https://www.nia.nih.gov/)\n\n\n\n**Final Thought:** This is a journey, and it\u2019s okay to feel scared and uncertain. Don't hesitate to seek support for yourself as well.  Taking the first step of talking to her doctor is the most important thing you can do right now.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Sleep seizures during the depression but they are gone now.Thanks for any input.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation with a lot going on.  Let's break down the eye shaking (nystagmus) and how it might relate to your various conditions and medications, but *please read the disclaimer at the end as this is not a substitute for medical advice*.\n\n**Understanding the Eye Shaking (Nystagmus)**\n\nYou describe nystagmus \u2013 involuntary, repetitive eye movements \u2013 specifically vertical (up and down) that occurs upon waking from poor or short sleep. There are several potential reasons for this, and in your case, likely multiple contributing factors playing a role:\n\n* **Fatigue & Muscle Strain (Your Hypothesis):** This is a *very* reasonable starting point.  When exhausted, the muscles responsible for controlling eye movement can be weaker and less coordinated.  Trying to keep your eyes open when fatigued definitely puts a strain on these muscles.  This is often *transient* nystagmus, meaning it goes away quickly once you're awake and functioning. This is often how it presents when it's purely related to fatigue.\n* **Migraine:** Migraines *can* be associated with nystagmus.  Even if you don\u2019t currently have a headache, the neurological changes that happen *during* a migraine process can linger and manifest as nystagmus. Migraines can profoundly affect neurological function.  The history of chronic migraines makes this a strong consideration.  The spots on your brain, originally suspected as MS lesions, could potentially be related to migraine vascular changes.\n* **Neurological Issues - Reconsidering MS/Similar:** While the MS diagnosis was inconclusive, the white matter lesions *need* to be considered in the context of your continued symptoms.  Even if it\u2019s *not* classic MS, other demyelinating or inflammatory conditions could be at play. The mixed MS testing is a flag that warrants continuing investigation if the symptoms persist or worsen.\n* **Medication Side Effects:**  Several of your medications *could* potentially contribute to neurological symptoms, including nystagmus, although it's not a common side effect of all of them.\n    * **Epitol (Topiramate):** An anticonvulsant (used for epilepsy and sometimes migraines). Nystagmus *is* a known side effect of topiramate, especially at higher doses. 200mg is on the lower end, but still within the range where it can occur.\n    * **Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine):** A muscle relaxant.  While less common, it *can* cause dizziness and, less often, neurological side effects. \n    * **Mirtazapine:** While primarily an antidepressant, it can have some effects on histamine and other neurotransmitters that could potentially contribute to neurological symptoms in sensitive individuals.  Because you just started it, this is something to monitor closely.\n* **Systemic Scleroderma:**  The condition itself can involve neurological manifestations, though nystagmus isn\u2019t a typical primary symptom.  However, it's worth considering that the autoimmune process could be contributing (even indirectly) to neurological vulnerability.\n* **Sleep:** Poor sleep exacerbates nearly all neurological symptoms.  Even with the Mirtazapine, if your sleep quality isn\u2019t improving, the underlying fatigue will continue to be a major factor. Sleep seizures are *very* serious and even though they're gone now it's important to ensure they stay that way.\n\n\n\n**Putting It Together \u2013 Your Specific Case**\n\nGiven your history, the most likely explanation is a *combination* of factors:\n\n1. **Fatigue/Muscle Strain:**  This is the most immediate trigger given your description of when it happens (waking up tired).\n2. **Migraine:** Your chronic migraines are a significant underlying factor, potentially contributing to the neurological landscape.\n3. **Epitol:** The topiramate is a potential direct cause.\n4. **The \"Grey Area\" of Neurological Findings:** The inconclusive MS testing means there's still some uncertainty about underlying neurological pathology (and the white spots on your brain).\n\n\n\n\n**Recommendations (Things to Discuss with Your Doctors)**\n\n1. **Neurologist Review:** *Crucially*, you need to revisit a neurologist who is familiar with your case.  Specifically:\n    * **Discuss the nystagmus in detail.** Describe when it happens, how long it lasts, and what makes it better or worse.\n    * **Re-evaluate the prior MS testing.**  Is further investigation warranted?  (e.g., repeat MRI, lumbar puncture).\n    * **Medication Review:** Discuss the potential role of topiramate and Flexeril in causing or worsening the nystagmus. Could the dose of topiramate be adjusted (under very careful monitoring, *never* stop it abruptly)? Could Flexeril be minimized or discontinued?\n2. **Sleep Specialist:** Consider a consultation with a sleep specialist. Poor sleep is compounding everything, and they can help optimize your sleep hygiene and potentially identify any underlying sleep disorders.  Monitor the effects of the mirtazapine on your sleep.\n3. **Rheumatologist:**  Continue working with your rheumatologist to manage your scleroderma.  Discuss the possibility of any neurological implications of your condition.\n4. **Migraine Management:**  Ensure your migraine treatment plan is optimized.

        "question": "Bipolar, OCD, TL Epilepsy (I am questioning this, diagnosed with absence seizures but I don\u2019t think this fits) 200mg Topamax 2x daily, 200mg sertraline, 3mg risperidone, 30mg abilify, 1000IU vitamin D, 40mg somac, I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was around 17-18, but my neurologist just doesn\u2019t really listen to me. He diagnosed me with absence seizures but the problem is I\u2019ve never forgotten a seizure or lost consciousness. Now I\u2019m realising that what he\u2019s called my \u2018motor tics\u2019 could be seizures as well. Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I\u2019m off my meds. But the past week I haven\u2019t really been sleeping and I\u2019ve had the flu and I\u2019ve been unable to twitch and it\u2019s like the feeling is building up in the back of my head and its getting really uncomfortable and making it sometimes hard to breathe. Sometimes painful. The feeling is completely involuntary, kind of like a sneeze, and it feels like when you can\u2019t sneeze. What should I do? My neurologist doesn\u2019t listen to me. I have a GP appointment in 2 days, should I talk to her about it?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack, and you're right to be concerned and to advocate for yourself. It sounds incredibly frustrating that you feel your neurologist isn't hearing your concerns about the nature of these events. You're also right to re-evaluate a diagnosis, especially when it doesn't fully *feel* right to you. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, what to expect, and what you should do, geared towards your GP appointment.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding Your Concerns**\n\n* **Questioning the Epilepsy Diagnosis:** The fact you've *never* experienced loss of consciousness or amnesia after these events is a *significant* point. Classic absence seizures *typically* involve a brief lapse in awareness.  The fact that you\u2019re questioning this, paired with the head jerks and sensations, is absolutely valid.\n* **\"Motor Tics\" vs. Seizures:** You're onto something important here. While tics are often suppressible (though effortful), seizures are generally involuntary. Your description of a build-up, the feeling like an electrical pulse, and the grunting suggest a neurological event that might well be a focal seizure, rather than a tic.  Tics are usually more repetitive and less associated with a distinct sensation beforehand.\n* **Medication and Symptoms:** The worsening when off meds is expected, as the meds are suppressing *something*.  However, the current episode \u2013 the building sensation, difficulty breathing, and pain \u2013 sounds *different* and potentially concerning, even with the ongoing background of whatever your neurologist has labeled as seizures or tics. This could also be related to the flu, but needs investigation.\n* **The \"Can't Sneeze\" Analogy:** This is a really insightful way to describe it \u2013 that pre-sneeze, building pressure sensation. That suggests a neurological impulse building that *needs* to discharge, lending more weight to a seizure possibility.\n* **Complex Medication Regimen:**  You're on a fairly complex combination of medications. Interactions and side effects are always a possibility.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do Before Your GP Appointment**\n\n1. **Detailed Symptom Journal:**  This is *crucial*.  Your GP needs concrete information.  Include:\n    * **Date and Time of each episode:** Even approximate times are helpful.\n    * **Description of the Sensation:** Be VERY specific.  \"Electrical pulse at the base of my skull, left side,\" \"building pressure like needing to sneeze,\" pain level (1-10), location of the pain.\n    * **What Happens During the Episode:**  Head jerk direction (forward, back, to the side), grunting, any other movements, any changes in awareness, any feelings *during* the episode (fear, confusion, etc.).\n    * **Triggers (if any):** Stress, lack of sleep, illness (like the flu), specific activities.\n    * **What makes it better or worse:**  Medication (when does it occur in relation to doses?), rest, etc.\n    * **Impact on Daily Life:** Does it interfere with work/school/social activities?\n2. **Medication List:** Bring a *complete and accurate* list of all medications, dosages, and how often you take them.\n3. **Write Down Your Questions:** Don't rely on remembering.  Examples:\n    * \"I question my epilepsy diagnosis because I've never experienced loss of consciousness. Could these events be something else?\"\n    * \"I'm concerned that what I was told were tics might actually be focal seizures. Can we explore that possibility?\"\n    * \"This recent build-up of sensation, difficulty breathing, and pain is new and worrying. It's different from my usual symptoms. What could be causing this?\"\n    * \"Given my medications, could there be any interactions or side effects contributing to these symptoms?\"\n    * \u201cI\u2019m not feeling heard by my neurologist. Is it possible to get a second opinion from another neurologist?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n**What to Expect at Your GP Appointment**\n\n* **Be Assertive (But Respectful):**  You know your body best.  Clearly and calmly explain your concerns.  Don't downplay anything. Do not be afraid to advocate for your need to be heard.\n* **Physical Exam:** Your GP will likely do a general physical exam, and may assess your neurological function (reflexes, coordination, etc.).\n* **Medication Review:** The GP will review your medications looking for potential interactions or side effects.\n* **Discussion of Your Concerns:**  This is where your symptom journal will be invaluable.  Present it clearly.\n* **Possible Next Steps:**\n    * **Referral to a Different Neurologist:** This is the most important thing to ask for, especially since you feel your current neurologist isn't listening.  A fresh perspective is crucial.  Specifically ask for a neurologist with expertise in *epilepsy and seizure disorders*.\n    * **EEG:**  An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain activity.  While a normal EEG doesn\u2019t rule out seizures (especially focal ones), it\u2019s a standard test and will likely be requested. Your GP may initiate this, or refer you back to Neurology with a request for one.  Mention the timing of your symptoms to the neurologist \u2013 it\u2019s best if an EEG can be done *during* or shortly after an episode if possible.\n    * **MRI:**  An MRI of the brain can help rule out structural abnormalities.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out other medical conditions contributing to your symptoms.\n    * **Adjustments to Medication:** *Do not* make any changes to your medications without your doctor\u2019s guidance. However, the GP (in consultation with the neurologist) may consider adjustments based on your symptoms.\n\n\n\n**Specifically Regarding the Current Episode (Building Sensation/Difficulty Breathing)**\n\nThis warrants *immediate* attention. While it may be related to your usual pattern, the addition of breathing difficulty and pain suggests something more urgent. **If the sensation becomes overwhelming or your breathing becomes severely compromised, go to the Emergency Room.**  Tell your GP about this specifically \u2013 it's not just a continuation of your usual symptoms; it's a *change* and a potential *emergency*.\n\n**Resources**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) - Great information about epilepsy and seizure types.\n* **Tourette Association of America:** [https://www.tourette.org/](https://www.tourette.org/) - Useful info on tic disorders (even if you ultimately don't have one, it's good to understand the differences).\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "25 female, overweight, no smoking, on Jardiance, insulin, Copaxone generic. I feel exhausted all day, doesn't matter how much I sleep. I've been asleep for most of the past 3 days. All of my body hurts and even moving my arm is tiring and painful. I find speaking equally exhausting, too, like, I can't even explain. Using my voice is exhausting, too.I have diabetes, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, digestive stuff and as of new, undiagnosed liver problems. Have an electromyography and heart tests coming.I can't stay sitting. I need to lie down all the time.Had an overdose couple days ago, if that matters.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this sounds *extremely* serious and concerning. You are describing a constellation of symptoms \u2013 profound fatigue, widespread pain, inability to function, and a recent overdose attempt \u2013 layered on top of multiple chronic health conditions.  It is **critical** that you are actively seeking medical attention, and I want to emphasize that **this requires immediate and thorough evaluation.**  I'm going to break down why, and what needs to happen.  I will also include a very important crisis resource at the end.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the concerns, categorized, and what needs to be considered:**\n\n**1. The Immediate Aftermath of the Overdose:**\n\n*   **Crucially Important:** Even a \"couple of days ago\" is a very short time after an overdose. The effects, both physical and psychological, can linger and interact with your other conditions.  What did you overdose on?  This *must* be known by your medical team. It impacts how they evaluate everything else.  Overdoses can cause organ damage (including liver damage, which is already a concern), electrolyte imbalances, and neurological effects.\n*   **Psychological Impact:** Overdose attempts are often linked to deep emotional distress.  The fatigue and feeling of being overwhelmed could be significantly impacted by this.  You need mental health support *now*.\n\n**2. The Overlapping Medical Conditions - A Complex Picture**\n\n*   **Diabetes & Jardiance/Insulin:**  Uncontrolled diabetes can cause fatigue and weakness. Jardiance can sometimes cause dehydration, which contributes to fatigue. Insulin needs to be carefully managed. Blood sugar fluctuations can significantly impact energy levels.\n*   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS) & Copaxone:** MS is notorious for causing fatigue.  Copaxone can sometimes have side effects, though fatigue isn't typically the primary one.  However, the overall disease activity of MS can vary, and a flare-up could be contributing.\n*   **Epilepsy:**  Seizures, even subclinical ones (those you don't fully recognize), can cause post-ictal fatigue (exhaustion after a seizure) and muscle soreness. Epilepsy medications can also have side effects, including fatigue.\n*   **Undiagnosed Liver Problems:** This is *highly* significant. Liver problems can cause fatigue, pain (especially in the upper right abdomen), nausea, and many other symptoms. It's vital to get a diagnosis and start treatment. The overdose could have exacerbated liver issues.\n*   **Digestive Issues:** Digestive problems can impair nutrient absorption, leading to fatigue and weakness.\n\n**3. The Specific Symptoms - What They Tell Us**\n\n*   **Profound Fatigue (Unrelated to Sleep):**  This is *not* normal tiredness.  This suggests an underlying medical problem. The fact that sleep doesn't help points away from simple sleep deprivation.\n*   **Widespread Pain:** This is very concerning, along with the fatigue.  It could be related to MS, but it warrants investigation for other causes (like fibromyalgia, autoimmune conditions, or complications from the overdose).\n*   **Exhaustion from Speech:**  This is unusual and points to a significant problem with your energy production or neurological function.  It's not just physical tiredness; it's an overwhelming sense of exhaustion even from minimal exertion.\n*   **Inability to Sit/Need to Lie Down:** This indicates profound weakness and likely pain.\n*   **Electromyography (EMG) & Heart Tests:** These are good steps, but they only assess specific areas (nerves and heart). They may or may not explain the overall picture.\n\n\n\n**What NEEDS to Happen \u2013 and ASAP**\n\n1.  **IMMEDIATE Medical Attention:**  **Go to the Emergency Room (ER) or Urgent Care *today*.** Do not delay.  Tell them about the overdose, your medications, and *all* of your symptoms.  The ER can do a more comprehensive assessment.\n2.  **Full Blood Work:**  A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP \u2013 to check liver and kidney function, electrolytes), thyroid function tests (TFTs), Vitamin D levels, and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) are essential.  They should also check for specific toxins related to the overdose.\n3.  **Liver Function Tests:**  These are *critical* given your suspected liver problems.  This includes bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels.\n4.  **Cardiac Evaluation:** The heart tests are good, but make sure they are thorough (EKG, and potentially an echocardiogram).\n5.  **Neurological Evaluation:**  Your neurologist needs to be involved *immediately*. They need to assess your MS, epilepsy, and the possibility of a flare-up or new neurological issues.\n6. **Mental Health Assessment:** You *need* to speak with a psychiatrist or mental health professional *today*. The overdose attempt indicates significant distress.\n7. **Medication Review:** Have all your doctors review your medication list to check for interactions and side effects contributing to your symptoms.  Given your multiple conditions, this is essential.\n\n\n**Important Considerations for When You Seek Care:**\n\n*   **Be Honest:**  Tell the medical team everything, including the overdose and all your symptoms, even if you are embarrassed or ashamed.  Withholding information can hinder their ability to help you.\n*   **Advocate for Yourself:**  If you feel like your concerns are not being taken seriously, speak up.  Bring a friend or family member with you if possible to help advocate.\n*   **Bring a List:**  Prepare a list of all your medications, allergies, and medical history.\n\n\n\n**CRISIS RESOURCES (Please use these if you are having thoughts of harming yourself):**\n\n*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada. In the UK, you can call 111.  This is available 24/7, free, and confidential.  https://988lifeline.org/\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.\n*   **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)\n*   **Your local emergency services:** Call 911 (or your country's emergency number) if you are in immediate danger.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Age 35, Sex F, Height 5\u20192\u201d, Weight 135Trying to keep this short and sweet, but can provide infinite additional information/context if requested. I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse. So uh\u2026 yeah.Thoughts? Feelings? I briefly caught part of it on video, but have no idea how to post that here.I greatly appreciate any input.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That sounds *terrifying* and incredibly frustrating, especially the dismissive response from the neurologist. You are absolutely right to feel like something isn't adding up and that this feels very different than any typical seizure description. Let's break this down. I'm not a doctor, so this is *not* medical advice, but a discussion of possibilities given your description, and how to advocate for yourself.\n\n**Why Your Concerns are Valid (and why the \"Psychogenic\" label is premature):**\n\n* **The Sequence is Highly Specific:** The progression\u2014eye flutter -> \"out of body\" sensation -> leg spasms -> tingling -> facial twitching/numbness and speech difficulty\u2014is *very* sequential and patterned.  Psychogenic (also called functional neurological symptom disorder or conversion disorder) seizures, while real in terms of the experience, are usually more chaotic and less predictable in their presentation than what you describe. They don\u2019t often follow such a tight, ordered sequence.\n* **Focal Symptoms:** Your symptoms started and shifted right-sided. This suggests something affecting a specific pathway in the brain or nervous system, leaning *away* from a purely psychological origin. Psychogenic events can *present* with focal symptoms, BUT typically investigation will first focus on possible organic causes.\n* **Weakness:**  The inability to lift your legs is concerning.  True weakness (even transient) doesn\u2019t usually align with a psychogenic event.\n* **Neurologist's Reaction:** His dismissive attitude without even witnessing the event and immediately jumping to a psychological explanation is, frankly, poor medical practice. A good neurologist investigates *before* diagnosing. An EEG can be normal even during some seizure activity, especially if it's focal or infrequent.\n* **New Onset and Lymph Node:** The fact that this started *after* discovering the enlarged lymph node is a critical piece of information. It's crucial to investigate if there's a connection, even if the biopsy was negative. Lymph nodes can sometimes be part of systemic conditions.\n\n**What This *Could* Be (Some possibilities \u2013 requires investigation, not self-diagnosis!):**\n\nGiven the context of the lymph node and the specific nature of your symptoms, here's a brainstorm of possible (and by no means definitive) things to discuss with doctors. These are organized roughly from more common/less dramatic to less common/more concerning.\n\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines can present with very unusual neurological symptoms *before* or during the headache phase, including focal weakness, sensory disturbances, and altered perception. The \u201cout of body\u201d feeling could be related to this. However, migraine typically doesn't cause such a strict sequence.\n* **Focal Seizure (Despite the Normal EEG):** EEGs only capture brain activity at a specific point in time. A focal seizure could be happening *between* EEG readings. Interictal EEGs (EEGs done when you are *not* actively having symptoms) can miss things. A longer-term EEG monitoring (ambulatory EEG) might be helpful.  Different types of focal seizures don't always look the same on an EEG.\n* **Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Other Demyelinating Disease:** These conditions involve damage to the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers. This can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, sometimes in a relapsing-remitting pattern. This could explain the sensory/motor issues.\n* **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** This is a rare but serious condition where the immune system attacks the brain. Symptoms can be varied and often mimic other neurological disorders.\n* **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** This is a rare syndrome where the body\u2019s immune system attacks healthy cells because of cancer somewhere in the body (even if the cancer is slow-growing or hidden). Since you have a history of an enlarged lymph node, it needs to be seriously considered. A negative biopsy doesn\u2019t always rule out cancer, and even if it wasn\u2019t cancer in the lymph node, another cancer could be present.\n* **Vascular Issue:** A small stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) could potentially cause these symptoms, especially the weakness. While less likely given the cyclical nature, it's worth considering.\n\n\n\n**What You Need To Do (Advocating for Yourself):**\n   * **Document EVERYTHING:**  Keep a detailed log of each episode - time, duration of each phase (eye flutter, \"out of body,\" etc.), any triggers you notice, what you're doing when it happens, and any changes in your symptoms.\n   * **Attempt Video Again:**  If you can safely record another episode, *do it*. Even a short clip can be incredibly helpful. There are ways to share videos online privately with your doctor (ask them how to send it securely - do *not* post personal medical information publicly).\n   * **Demand Further Investigation:** Do *not* accept the \"psychogenic\" label without a thorough workup.  Specifically ask for:\n      * **MRI of the Brain and Spinal Cord with and without contrast:** This is *essential*. MRI is much more sensitive than CT scans for detecting subtle abnormalities, inflammation, or lesions.\n      * **Long-Term EEG (Ambulatory EEG):** Monitor brain activity over 24-72 hours.\n      * **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** To analyze cerebrospinal fluid for signs of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune activity.\n      * **Repeat Imaging of the Lymph Node (and potentially other areas):** With the new symptoms, and the timing, re-evaluating the lymph node, and potentially with different imaging modalities is warranted.\n      * **Blood Tests:** Comprehensive blood work to check for autoimmune markers, inflammation, vitamin deficiencies, and other potential causes.\n   * **Get a Second Opinion:** This is crucial. Find a neurologist who is open-minded and willing to listen to your concerns.  A neuroimmunologist (specialist in neurological autoimmune disorders) would be a good choice.\n   * **Be Assertive:** You know your body best.  Don't be afraid to push back against dismissive doctors and insist on getting the testing you need. Bring a friend or family member with you for support if that helps.\n   * **Focus on Objective Data:**  Emphasize the specific sequence of events, the weakness you experienced, and the fact that the symptoms started *after* the lymph node was found. Steer the conversation away from emotional states.\n\n\n\n**Regarding the \"Out of Body\" Feeling:**  That's a particularly unsettling symptom and deserves investigation. It could be related to disruptions in brain networks involved in self-awareness and spatial orientation.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou are rightfully concerned. Your experience isn\u2019t typical of a simple psychogenic event, and the neurologist\u2019s response was inadequate. Don't let him invalidate your experience. You are a smart, aware person who described a very specific and concerning pattern.  Advocate for yourself, get the testing you need, and find a doctor who will take your concerns seriously.\n\n\n\n**To help me refine any suggestions, could you tell me:**\n\n*  What specific type of biopsy was done on the lymph node? (Fine needle aspiration, core biopsy, excisional biopsy?)\n*  Any other symptoms not mentioned? (Fatigue, fever, weight loss, headaches, visual changes, etc.)\n*  Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions or a family history of neurological disorders?\n\nI truly hope you get answers and appropriate care soon.  This is a lot to deal with, and I'm sending you strength."

        "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably concerning, and you're doing the right thing by continuing to investigate with a neurologist. It's good you have a neurologist already involved, and you've already had an EEG (though one normal EEG doesn't rule everything out, as we'll discuss). Let's break down the possibilities, and I'll try to give you a framework for thinking about it, and questions to ask your neurologist.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is *not* a substitute for medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n* **Tremors since infancy:**  The fact that tremors have been present since babyhood is significant.  The initial \"growing out of it\" prediction is common, but ongoing tremors warrant continued investigation, especially with new symptoms.\n* **One Seizure, Normal EEG:**  A single seizure is always concerning. Since the 4-hour EEG didn't show epileptiform activity (the specific patterns associated with epilepsy), it makes a *typical* epilepsy diagnosis less likely. However, EEGs can be normal *between* seizures.  Also, there are many types of seizures, and some are less likely to be captured on a standard EEG.\n* **New Symptom: Eye Closing & Head Shaking (\"Sour Face\" Reaction):** This is the most pressing thing right now.  The description is very helpful - it sounds like an involuntary reaction.  This is what we need to focus on understanding.\n\n\n\n**Possible Explanations (and likelihood, with caveats)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of possibilities, from less concerning to more concerning, with notes on how likely they are given what you've told me.  I'll also include what would point *towards* that diagnosis.\n\n**1. Benign/Functional (Less Concerning):**\n\n*   **Habit/Tic:** This is *possible,* especially if there's any anxiety or stress in his life. A tic is an involuntary, repetitive movement or vocalization.  Tics often have a 'premonitory urge' - a feeling before the tic happens that is relieved by doing the tic.  However, they often don\u2019t involve eye closure. *Less likely* as a sole explanation given the tremors and history.\n*   **Normal Infant/Child Reflex or Behavior:** Some children have quirky facial expressions or movements.  If this is isolated and infrequent, it could be a normal variation. *This seems less likely given the tremors and the \"involuntary\" quality you describe.*\n\n**2.  Neurological Possibilities (More Investigation Needed):**\n\n*   **Myoclonus:** This is a sudden, brief, involuntary muscle jerk.  It can involve the face, head, or limbs.  There are many types of myoclonus:\n    *   **Benign Myoclonus:** Some types are very common, especially in childhood, and are not harmful.\n    *   **Symptomatic Myoclonus:** This is caused by an underlying neurological condition.  This is where the history of tremors becomes relevant. *This is a strong possibility and warrants investigation.*\n*   **Dystonia:** This involves sustained muscle contractions, leading to twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Focal dystonia can affect specific muscle groups, like those in the face and neck, and could potentially manifest as head shaking and eye closure. *Possible, but the \u201csour face\u201d quality makes this a little less likely as the primary explanation.*\n*   **Paroxysmal Non-Epileptic Events (PNEEs):** These *look* like seizures, but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are often psychological in origin (like conversion disorder or functional neurological disorder), but can have multiple causes. Important to rule this out.\n*   **Atypical Seizures:** Even though your EEG was normal, there are seizure types (like absence seizures or myoclonic seizures) that can be infrequent, subtle, and difficult to capture on a routine EEG. The \"sour face\" reaction vaguely resembles some facial automatisms that can occur during seizures. *While the EEG was normal, this needs to be considered.*\n* **Movement Disorder:** Given the tremors from infancy, it's important to consider if this is a broader movement disorder that's evolving. Things like Cerebral Palsy, although usually diagnosed earlier, can sometimes present with evolving symptoms. Other rarer genetic movement disorders would also be in this category.\n\n**3. Metabolic/Other (Less Common, but must consider):**\n\n*   **Metabolic Disorder:**  Rarely, metabolic imbalances can cause neurological symptoms.\n*   **Teething:** *Very unlikely* to cause this in an older child (if your son is past the typical teething age \u2013 you didn\u2019t mention his age). Teething can cause mild irritation, but not coordinated movements like this.\n\n\n\n\n**What to Do & Questions for Your Neurologist**\n\n1.  **Video Recording:** *Crucially*, try to video record an episode when it happens. This will be *extremely* helpful for the neurologist.  Capture the entire event \u2013 what precedes it, what the movements look like, and how long it lasts.\n2.  **Detailed Symptom Log:**  Keep a log of:\n    *   **Frequency:** How often are these episodes happening?\n    *   **Timing:**  Are they happening at specific times of day?  After activity?  When he's tired?\n    *   **Triggers:**  Anything that seems to bring them on? (Stress, excitement, illness, etc.)\n    *   **Duration:** How long does each episode last?\n    *   **Associated Symptoms:**  Anything else happening at the same time? (Changes in alertness, breathing, color, etc.)\n3. **Next Steps with Neurologist \u2013 Questions to Ask:**\n    *   \"Could this be a form of myoclonus? What kind of testing would you recommend to investigate that?\" (e.g., more specialized EEG, MRI).\n    *   \"Given his history of tremors, could this be related to a broader movement disorder?\"\n    *    \"Is it possible this is a type of seizure that might not show up on a standard EEG? Should we consider a prolonged EEG (hospital stay) or ambulatory EEG?\"\n    *   \"How do we rule out paroxysmal non-epileptic events?\" (This may involve a video-EEG study, and/or psychiatric evaluation).\n    *   \"What other tests might be helpful, given the combination of tremors and these new episodes?\" (Consider blood tests to rule out metabolic issues, or genetic testing if appropriate.)\n    *  \"Should we consult with a movement disorder specialist?\"\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Panic:**  While these symptoms need investigating, try to remain calm.  Anxiety can make it harder to observe and document the symptoms accurately.\n*   **Trust Your Instincts:** You know your son best.  If you feel like something isn't right, keep pushing for answers.\n*   **Second Opinion:**  If you are not satisfied with the answers you are getting, consider getting a second opinion from another neurologist, preferably one specializing in pediatric movement disorders.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably worrying you, and it's good you have an appointment with an epilepsy specialist. Your doctor is right to defer detailed interpretation to someone who specializes in EEGs and seizure disorders.  I will do my best to break down the report, but **please read the *very important disclaimer* at the end.** This is *not* a diagnosis, and my explanation is for informational purposes only.\n\nLet's go through the report section by section:\n\n**1. Examination Conditions:**\n\n* **19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG:** This simply describes how the EEG was conducted. It means electrodes were placed across your scalp (convexity refers to the curved surface of the brain), and 24 channels of brain activity were recorded.  The numbers in parentheses refer to the specific placement of electrodes.\n* **Bi- and monopolar:**  This relates to how the electrodes were configured to record the signal (technical detail).\n* **At rest, with HV and under flickering light:** The EEG was recorded while you were relaxed (\"at rest\"), during hyperventilation (deep, rapid breathing - \"HV\"), and while looking at a flickering light. These are standard provocations used to try and bring out any abnormal brain activity.\n\n**2. In Peace (At Rest):**\n\n* **\"Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity...\"**: This describes your basic brainwave activity when resting.  \"10 c/s\" refers to 10 cycles per second (Hertz), which falls into the alpha wave range. Alpha waves are normal when you're relaxed with your eyes closed. \"Amplitude-unstable\" means the waves are varying in size. \"Moderately pronounced\" suggests it's a fairly typical alpha activity, but not overly strong.\n* **\"...with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas...\"**: This is where things start to become a little more noteworthy. Intermittent slower waves alongside the typical alpha suggest some disruption of the normal rhythm. Beta waves (faster frequencies) can be normal during thinking and alertness, but their presence alongside the slower activity is worth noting.  The fact this spreads to different areas (centroparietal \u2013 middle-back of your head, and temporal \u2013 sides of your head) suggests it\u2019s not a very localized issue.\n* **\"...and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids.\"**: Normally, when you open your eyes, alpha wave activity *decreases* (alpha blocking). The fact that this reactivity is \"incomplete\" suggests something may be interfering with the normal process.\n* **\"Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity.\"**:  The Central and Temporal areas are normal but the low voltage f3 activity in the frontal lobe may signify some issue.\n* **\"In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes.\"**: This is the most significant finding.\n    * **Dysrhythmias:** Refers to irregular brainwave patterns.  \"Discontinuous\" suggests they aren't happening constantly.\n    * **Regional:** These are happening in specific areas \u2013 left temporal (side of the head), mid-frontotemporal (between the front and side) and front brain area.\n    * **T3-F7, F3-FP1:** These are specific electrode locations where the dysrhythmias are most prominent.\n    * **Rudimentary sharp wave complexes:** This is the most concerning part, and likely why you were referred to a specialist. \"Sharp waves\" are brief, high-amplitude waves.  \"Rudimentary\" means they are not fully formed, but their presence *can* be associated with seizure activity, even if they aren't causing obvious clinical seizures.  They can also occur in other conditions.\n\n**3. Under Flickering Light:**\n\n* **\"No activation signs.\"**:  This is a good thing! Flickering light can sometimes trigger seizures in photosensitive individuals.  The fact that there were no changes doesn\u2019t rule anything out, but it's reassuring.\n\n**4. Under Hyperventilation:**\n\n* **\"Slight activation of the regional changes described.\"**: This means the dysrhythmias and possibly the sharp waves became slightly more noticeable during hyperventilation. This can also be suggestive of seizure activity, but again, doesn't confirm it.\n\n\n\n**What does this *potentially* mean?**\n\nBased on this report, the neurologist likely wants the epilepsy specialist to investigate the possibility of:\n\n*   **Focal Epilepsy:** Seizures starting in a specific area of your brain. The left temporal and frontal regions are flagged by the report.\n*   **Epileptiform Abnormalities:** The \"rudimentary sharp waves\" fit this category. This means there's evidence of brain activity that *could* be a precursor to or associated with seizures.\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:**  It's important to remember that abnormal EEGs aren't *always* epilepsy. Other conditions can cause similar findings.\n\n**Your Symptoms and the EEG:**\n\nYour symptoms \u2013 fatigue, disorientation, difficulty concentrating, trembling, and the \"weird feeling\" \u2013 *could* be related to subtle seizure activity, even if you're not having obvious convulsions.  These symptoms are also very common in many other conditions (anxiety, migraine, etc.). That's why the specialist will need to correlate the EEG findings with your clinical presentation.\n\n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\n*   **I am not a medical professional.** I cannot diagnose or interpret medical tests. This information is for general understanding only, based on my knowledge of medical terminology and EEG reports.\n*   **Google Translate can introduce errors.** While you've done your best to translate, there may be nuances lost in translation. The specialist will have the original report from the neurologist.\n*   **EEG interpretation is complex.** A skilled epilepsy specialist will consider the EEG findings in the context of your medical history, symptoms, neurological examination, and potentially other tests (like MRI).\n*   **Don't self-diagnose.** This information is meant to help you understand the report *so you can ask informed questions of your specialist*.\n\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n1.  **Keep your appointment with the epilepsy specialist.**\n2.  **Write down all your symptoms in detail.** Include when they started, how often they occur, what makes them better or worse, and how they impact your life.\n3.  **Prepare a list of questions for the specialist.**  Don't hesitate to ask them to explain the EEG results in clear language.\n\nI hope this helps, even though it's a lot to take in.  Try to stay calm, and focus on getting a clear understanding from the specialist.  They are best equipped to help you.  Good luck! Let me know if you have any other questions (keeping in mind my limitations as a non-medical professional)."

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that's a *lot* of information, and you're right to be thinking critically about this, especially given your medical knowledge and awareness. You're doing the work of a conscientious patient, and it's good you're bringing these concerns up. Here's a breakdown, addressing your concerns and laying out points to discuss with your psychiatrist.  I'll try to categorize it for clarity.  **Disclaimer at the end \u2013 this is *not* medical advice.**\n\n**1. The Polypharmacy & Interactions: You're Right to Be Concerned**\n\nYou've pinpointed the core issue: a complex medication regimen with several potential interactions. While individual medications might be \"safe enough to double\" in isolation, the *combination* changes things significantly.  You're correct to be focusing on the lowered seizure threshold.  Here's a deeper dive into the specific concerns:\n\n* **Trazodone + Bupropion (Wellbutrin):** This is a concerning combination. Both drugs can lower the seizure threshold. While the absolute risk is still relatively low, layering these risks is dangerous. Bupropion inhibits the metabolism of Trazodone, potentially increasing Trazodone levels and exacerbating side effects, including seizure risk.  This is the *most* significant interaction in your list.\n* **Trazodone + Adderall:** Both can affect blood pressure and heart rate. While not a direct seizure risk, the combined cardiovascular effects could be problematic, especially with your already elevated resting heart rate.  Plus, Adderall can increase anxiety, potentially negating some of the benefits of Trazodone. It also raises blood pressure.\n* **Adderall + Bupropion:** Both are dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.  This can lead to increased stimulation, anxiety, and potential cardiovascular effects.  Again, it's a synergy that increases overall risk.\n* **Klonopin + Everything:**  Benzodiazepines like Klonopin have their own set of interactions, particularly with other CNS depressants (like Trazodone).  While the PRN use is somewhat mitigating, frequent use (even PRN) contributes to overall sedative load and potential cognitive impairment.\n\n**2. Your Psychiatrist's Approach \u2013 Red Flags & Context**\n\nYour description of your psychiatrist is\u2026 unusual. She sounds competent in terms of formal training, but her approach is *highly* permissive, almost to a fault. Saying \"safe to double the dose\" across the board is incredibly irresponsible in the context of multiple interacting medications.  Here's what\u2019s concerning:\n\n* **Dismissing Interactions:** The drug interaction checkers aren't perfect, but they're a useful starting point for discussion.  A good psychiatrist shouldn't dismiss them out of hand.\n* **Lack of Caution:** The \u201cdouble the dose\u201d comment is a massive red flag. It suggests a lack of nuance and careful consideration of your individual risks.  \n* **\"Hippy\" Approach:**  While there's nothing wrong with a holistic approach, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of sound pharmacological principles.\n* **Casual Relationship:**  While the casual dynamic might feel comfortable for *you*, it could be hindering your care.  You, as a knowledgeable future physician, are essentially self-treating with her rubber-stamping your choices.  This isn't a collaborative partnership.\n\n\n\n**3. Addressing Your Symptoms \u2013 A More Targeted Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s break down each symptom and how this med setup is (or isn\u2019t) helping:\n\n* **Insomnia:** The reliance on Klonopin as a \"rescue\" is troubling. It masks the underlying problem and carries the risk of dependence. Trazodone has significant antihistaminic properties and can be helpful, but clearly isn\u2019t enough on its own.  \n* **GAD:** Klonopin is effective, but it\u2019s a band-aid.  It treats the *symptoms* of anxiety, not the root cause.  Long-term benzodiazepine use can have cognitive side effects and the potential for withdrawal.\n* **Depression:** Wellbutrin is a reasonable choice given the insomnia (SSRIs can sometimes worsen it). However, it's possible it's contributing to the anxiety and stimulant effects.\n* **ADHD:** Adderall seems to be working, but it's exacerbating your heart rate issues and potentially your anxiety.\n\n**4. What You Should Discuss with Your Psychiatrist (and Consider if the Conversation Doesn't Go Well)**\n\nYou need to have a frank and direct conversation with your psychiatrist.  Here\u2019s what to say:\n\n* **\"I'm concerned about the multiple drug interactions, particularly the increased risk of seizures with the combination of Trazodone and Bupropion.\"**  Present your research.  Ask for a detailed explanation of *why* she believes these combinations are safe for *you*.  Don't accept \"I've been doing this for years\" as an answer.\n* **\u201cI\u2019m worried about my reliance on Klonopin for sleep. Can we explore alternative strategies for managing my insomnia?\u201d**  Consider:\n    * **Sleep Hygiene:**  (You likely already practice good sleep hygiene, but reiterate it.)\n    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):** This is the gold standard for chronic insomnia *without* medication. It\u2019s incredibly effective.\n    * **Lower Dose Trazodone + Melatonin/Magnesium:** Experiment with lower doses first.\n    * **Alternatives to Benzodiazepines (for sleep):**  Discuss options like low-dose mirtazapine (if depression is a significant factor), or other non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (though these also have their own risks).\n* **\u201cI\u2019d like to re-evaluate the role of Adderall in my regimen.  Are there non-stimulant options for ADHD that we could try?\u201d**\n* **\u201cI'm feeling uncomfortable with the 'double the dose' comment.  I understand you trust my self-awareness, but I need a more cautious and detailed discussion of risks and benefits for each medication.\"**\n* **Ask about a referral to a clinical pharmacist:**  They specialize in medication management and can provide a very thorough review of your regimen.\n\n**5. If the Conversation Doesn't Go Well\u2026**\n\nYou\u2019re in a unique position with your medical knowledge.  If your psychiatrist is dismissive or doesn't take your concerns seriously, you *need* to consider finding a new provider.  It\u2019s perfectly valid to seek a second opinion.  You deserve a psychiatrist who will listen to you, validate your concerns, and work with you to create a safe and effective treatment plan. Explain to a potential new psychiatrist your current medications, your rationale, and your concerns.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a really important question, and it's good you're thinking proactively about this. Here's a breakdown of things to consider, along with a *very strong disclaimer* at the end.  I'll try to cover this thoroughly, but remember this isn't medical advice.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n* **Pediatric Absence Seizures (Ped Mal):**  These seizures, now typically referred to as childhood absence seizures, *can* sometimes have a photosensitive component, meaning flashing lights *could* be a trigger for some individuals. However, it's also very common that they don't.  The fact that you've played many other flashing-light games without incident is significant.\n* **Lamotrigine (Lamictal):** 250mg is a fairly common and often effective dose for absence seizures.  The fact that you've been seizure-free *since starting* the medication is excellent. This indicates the medication is doing its job. However, medication doesn't *always* eliminate all risk; it often lowers it significantly.\n* **Photosensitivity is Individual:** Photosensitivity isn't an all-or-nothing thing. Some people are highly sensitive, others mildly, and many have no reaction at all.  Your history suggests you may be relatively resistant to visually triggered seizures.\n* **Game Warnings:** Game developers put those warnings on as a legal precaution.  They can't possibly know the seizure history or sensitivity of every player.  It's a \"better safe than sorry\" approach.  The *intensity* and *pattern* of the flashing are key.  A rapidly shifting strobe effect is more likely to be problematic than, say, constant flashing.\n* **Weight/BMI:**  Your weight is a factor your doctor will consider for medication dosage, but it doesn't directly relate to photosensitivity.\n* **Age:** While childhood-onset absence seizures can sometimes diminish with age, the risk of photosensitivity doesn\u2019t always disappear.\n\n\n\n**Factors to Consider Before Playing the Game**\n\n1. **What kind of flashing is it?** *Specifically*. The warning itself isn\u2019t enough.\n    *   **Frequency/Speed:**  Fast, regular flickering (5-30 Hz) is the most concerning.  The higher the frequency, the more concerning it is.\n    *   **Contrast:**  High-contrast flashes (e.g. bright white on black) are more likely to be problematic.\n    *   **Pattern:**  Rapidly changing patterns, strobing, or complex visually dynamic effects are more concerning than simple, consistent flashing.\n    *   **Coverage of the Screen:**  Does the flashing cover the entire screen, or is it limited to a small area? Full-screen flashing is more risky.\n\n2. **Your Past Experiences:** You've already had a significant self-experimentation, playing other games. You have a history that suggests you *may* tolerate many flashing effects well.  However, *this does not guarantee safety*.\n\n3. **Your Current Seizure Control:**  Being consistently seizure-free on Lamotrigine is very positive.  It suggests your brain is in a more stable state.  However, breakthrough seizures *can* still happen, even with medication.\n\n4. **Game Settings/Modifications:** \n    *   **Options to Reduce Flashing:** Does the game have settings to reduce the intensity of visual effects, disable flashing lights, or change color schemes?  *Use them!*\n    *   **Mods/Patches:** Are there any community-created modifications that reduce the visual intensity?\n\n5. **Environment:**\n    *   **Well-Lit Room:** Play in a well-lit room. Darkness increases the risk of a visually triggered seizure.\n    *   **Distance from Screen:**  Sit further back from the screen.  The closer you are, the more of your visual field is filled with flashing lights.\n    *   **Screen Size:** A smaller screen may be less problematic than a large one.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations (proceed with *extreme* caution)**\n\n1. **Talk to Your Neurologist (MOST IMPORTANT).**  This is the absolute, number one thing you should do.  Tell them about the game, the warning, and your history. They can give you personalized advice based on your specific condition, medication, and overall health.  *Do not start playing the game without consulting your doctor.*  They might even suggest an EEG while you're exposed to similar visual stimuli to assess your risk.\n\n2. **Start Slowly and Monitor Closely:** If, *and only if* your neurologist gives you the go-ahead (or after careful consideration and understanding the risks), try the game in short bursts. Be *extremely* vigilant for any warning signs:\n    *   Lightheadedness\n    *   Blurred vision\n    *   Eye strain\n    *   Headache\n    *   Unusual sensations (tingling, nausea)\n    *   Any feeling that a seizure is coming on.  (You may have a pre-seizure aura \u2013 know what yours is!).\n\n3. **Stop Immediately:** If you experience *any* of the warning signs, stop playing *immediately*.  Don't try to \"push through\" it.\n\n4. **Consider Recording Your Gameplay:** If you do play, consider recording your gameplay. This could be helpful to show your neurologist if you experience any issues.\n\n5. **Don't Play if Tired or Stressed:** Fatigue and stress can lower your seizure threshold, making you more vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  Playing a game with a photosensitivity warning carries *some* risk, and you need to assess that risk with your doctor.  I cannot and do not guarantee that playing the game will not cause a seizure. **Your health and safety are paramount.**  Ignoring warnings and medical advice can have serious consequences."

While you remain conscious and aware, some seizures *can* manifest as brief periods of impaired awareness (like staring) with subtle motor symptoms (twitching, jerking). These are called *focal aware seizures* (formerly known as simple partial seizures). Your description could fit this, although it requires a doctor to rule it in or out. The fact these episodes are happening in relation to alcohol consumption is particularly noteworthy, as alcohol can lower the seizure threshold.\n* **Non-Epileptic Psychogenic Events (NEPE) / Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  These events *look* like seizures, with similar symptoms, but they don't stem from abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  They are often related to psychological stress, trauma, or mental health conditions.  Your ASD diagnosis is relevant here, as individuals with ASD sometimes experience these types of events, particularly when under stress. The link to sleep deprivation also fits.\n* **Tics:** You already have a diagnosis of motor tics. It's possible your 'twitching' is an exacerbation of these, but the \"blanking out\" component is less typical of a simple tic. Though complex tics can involve a sequence of movements and can *sometimes* be preceded by a feeling of building tension, it's unlikely to cause complete unresponsiveness.\n* **Migraine:** Some types of migraine can cause brief periods of confusion or altered awareness, sometimes with neurological symptoms.\n* **Sleep Deprivation:**  Severe sleep deprivation *can* cause unusual neurological symptoms, including twitching and altered awareness. However, this usually improves with adequate sleep, and the pattern you describe seems more specific.\n* **Effects of Substances:** Alcohol and cannabis can both contribute to neurological changes and potentially trigger or exacerbate underlying conditions.  Specifically, alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures in some individuals (though you describe these occurring *during* or related to drinking, rather than withdrawal).\n\n**2. Why your concerns are valid & Why your family history matters:**\n\n* **Family History:**  As you mentioned, your cousin\u2019s history of seizures, especially triggered by alcohol, significantly increases your risk. Genetics play a role in many epilepsy syndromes.\n* **Triggers:** Alcohol and sleep disruption are common seizure triggers.\n* **The \"Blanking Out\" is Key:** The loss of responsiveness, even if you remain partially aware, is the most concerning aspect. This is not typical of simple tics.\n* **Transient but Recurring:**  The fact that it's come and gone, and is now returning, suggests something underlying is being re-activated by certain conditions.\n\n\n\n**3. Am I Overthinking?**\n\nNo, you are not overthinking.  You are being appropriately concerned and proactive given your symptoms *and* family history. It's excellent that you're noticing these patterns.\n\n\n\n**4. What Needs to Happen Next - Medical Evaluation is Crucial**\n\nYou *must* see a doctor. Here's what you should expect:\n\n* **Detailed Medical History:** The doctor will ask about your full medical history, including your ASD diagnosis, tics, substance use (be honest!), family history (specifically your cousin\u2019s seizures), and detailed descriptions of these episodes - what happens *before*, *during*, and *after*.\n* **Neurological Exam:** This assesses your reflexes, coordination, sensory function, and overall neurological health.\n* **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** *This is the most important test.* An EEG measures the electrical activity in your brain. It can help identify abnormal patterns that suggest epilepsy.  It's often done both while you are awake and asleep.  Sometimes, a \"sleep-deprived EEG\" is done (you're asked to reduce sleep the night before) to make seizures more likely to appear.\n* **Blood Tests:** To rule out other potential causes like metabolic imbalances or infections.\n* **Imaging (MRI):**  An MRI of the brain may be ordered to look for any structural abnormalities.\n* **Consideration of Video-EEG Monitoring:** If the EEG is normal but suspicion remains high, your doctor might recommend spending time in a hospital while hooked up to continuous EEG and video recording. This can capture an event if it happens.\n\n**5.  Important Lifestyle Considerations (While you're awaiting evaluation):**\n\n* **Reduce/Stop Alcohol:**  Given the potential link to your symptoms and your family history, abstaining from alcohol is strongly advised *until* you have a diagnosis.\n* **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for a consistent 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n* **Reduce/Stop Cannabis:**  Like alcohol, cannabis can potentially affect neurological function.\n* **Manage Stress:**  Find healthy ways to manage stress, as stress can exacerbate both neurological and psychological conditions.\n* **Keep a Detailed Diary:** Record every event. Include:\n    * Date and time\n    * What you were doing before\n    * What you felt *before* the event (e.g., stressed, tired, anxious)\n    * A precise description of what happened: What did it feel like? What did you see/hear? What did your body do? How long did it last?\n    * What happened *after* the event.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  Your symptoms warrant a thorough medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment plan.  Do not delay seeking medical attention.\n\n\n\n**To find a doctor:**\n\n* **Your Primary Care Physician:** Start with your regular doctor, who can refer you to a neurologist.\n* **Neurologist:** A specialist in disorders of the nervous system.\n* **Epileptologist:** A neurologist specializing in epilepsy.\n\n\n\nI hope this information is helpful.  Please take these concerns seriously and seek medical attention promptly.  I wish you the best in getting this sorted out."

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot of information, and you're right to be concerned and seeking input. It's *very* good you're being self-aware about the possibility of psychological factors playing a role, but the multiple episodes with varying, yet concerning, symptoms necessitate a thorough medical evaluation.  Let's break down your situation and address your questions.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only.**\n\n**1. Could this be seizures?**\n\nIt's **absolutely possible** you are experiencing some kind of seizure activity, but the atypical presentation makes it complex. Your girlfriend's experience with non-epileptic seizures is helpful context, but her experience doesn't *diagnose* you. Here's why it's leaning towards needing investigation:\n\n*   **Variety of Symptoms:** The episodes aren't classic tonic-clonic (full body jerking) seizures, but seizures *can* manifest in many ways, particularly focal seizures. Your descriptions \u2013 the feeling of heaviness, electric shock, difficulty speaking, staring, altered perceptions (visual flashbacks, mannequin thoughts), and post-ictal confusion/fatigue \u2013 align with possible focal onset seizures.\n*   **Auras:** The nausea, anxiety/anger, chest sensations, droopy eyelids and pre-episode \"weird\" feelings *could* be auras \u2013 warning signs that precede a seizure.\n*   **Triggers:**  Fatty/sugary foods or fatigue *can* potentially be seizure triggers for some individuals, although it\u2019s less common.\n*   **Progression/Frequency:** The fact that the episodes are happening somewhat consistently, even if varying, and that you've noticed a potential increase is concerning.\n*   **Impact on Function:**  Even if brief, the difficulty speaking, altered awareness, and the need to lie down are disruptions in normal function.\n\n**2. Is it Migraine Aura?**\n\nWhile it *could* be migraine with complex aura, your descriptions go beyond typical aura symptoms.  Migraine aura usually involves visual disturbances (flashing lights, zig-zag lines), sensory changes (numbness, tingling), or speech disturbances. The emotional component (sudden anger) and the feeling of being physically \"stuck\" or unable to move are less common with migraine alone.  Also, the visual flashbacks to childhood are unusual for typical migraine aura. Migraine aura also usually precedes a headache, which you mention you get, but not always in connection with these episodes.\n\n**3. Can you be \"faking\" or making it up for attention?**\n\nThis is the anxiety talking, and it's admirable that you're asking this. While it's *possible* there's a psychological component (see point 7 below), the complexity of your symptoms and their physical nature make it highly unlikely you are consciously faking them.  Your concern about attention-seeking is a sign of your own self-awareness, which is not consistent with someone deliberately fabricating symptoms.  However,  anxiety and depression *can* sometimes manifest in unusual somatic (body-focused) symptoms, and it's good to explore that possibility with a professional.\n\n**4. Medications and Marijuana - Potential Interactions**\n\n*   **Bupropion:** While not directly linked to seizures in most people, bupropion *does* lower the seizure threshold. This means it makes it easier for seizures to occur in individuals predisposed to them. This is a *very* important consideration given your recent episodes.\n*   **Buspirone:**  Less likely to directly lower seizure threshold but in combination with other medications can increase risks.\n*   **Hydroxyzine:** Generally doesn\u2019t increase risk for seizures.\n*   **Glycopyrrolate:** Also doesn\u2019t usually increase risk of seizures.\n*   **Marijuana:** This is complex.  There is some evidence that high THC levels *can* lower the seizure threshold in some people.  The regularity of your use (4x/week) could be a factor, especially given your other medications.\n\n**5. Other Important Concerns & Things to Pay Attention To**\n\n*   **Weight Loss & Decreased Exercise Tolerance:** A 20lb weight loss and decline in your physical fitness are significant. This needs investigation to rule out other underlying medical conditions.\n*   **Dizziness:**  Recurring dizziness, even without fainting, should be investigated, as it could be related to the potential seizure activity, low blood pressure, inner ear problems, or other cause.\n*   **Headaches/Silent Migraines:**  The frequency of your headaches needs to be discussed with a doctor.\n*   **Detailed Episode Log:** Start a very detailed log of each episode. Include:\n    *   Date and Time\n    *   What you were doing *immediately* before, during, and after the episode.\n    *   Precise description of sensations (e.g., heaviness, electric shock, thoughts, emotions).\n    *   Duration of each phase of the episode.\n    *   What medications you took in the 24 hours leading up to it.\n    *   What you ate/drank in the hours preceding it.\n    *   Level of stress/anxiety before the episode.\n    *   What your girlfriend observed (if she's present).\n\n**6. What should you do *immediately*?**\n\n**See a Doctor\u2014Specifically a Neurologist\u2014ASAP.**  Do not delay. Explain everything you\u2019ve told me, and emphasize:\n\n*   The potential seizures (describe them as you have to me).\n*   Your medication list (include doses and how long you've been on each).\n*   Your marijuana use.\n*   The weight loss and decreased exercise tolerance.\n*   The dizziness.\n*   The headaches.\n*   Your family history (does anyone have epilepsy or migraines?).\n\nThe neurologist will likely recommend:\n\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To measure brain activity and look for seizure patterns.  A normal EEG doesn't *rule out* seizures (especially focal seizures), so they may recommend a longer-term EEG or video-EEG monitoring.\n*   **MRI of the Brain:** To look for any structural abnormalities.\n*   **Blood Tests:**  To check for metabolic imbalances or other medical conditions that could be contributing.\n\n**7. Addressing the Anxiety/Depression**\n\nContinue therapy if you're in it. Your anxiety is clearly playing a role in your concern, and addressing that is important regardless of the physical cause. The neurological evaluation will help clarify things and reduce your anxiety. Your mental health team can help you navigate the diagnostic process and cope with uncertainty.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed with EA2 after an unexpected hospital stay. Of course I have been researching the condition, and came across 4-AP. I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won\u2019t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn\u2019t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly frustrating. Being diagnosed with EA2 is challenging enough, and then to feel like your concerns aren't being adequately addressed, and face barriers to potential treatment options, is a lot to handle. It's completely understandable that you're actively researching and seeking solutions. Let's break down the situation and explore some avenues for you, given the information you've provided.  I'll aim to be thorough, but remember **I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.** This is for informational purposes only and a discussion point for *your* conversations with qualified medical professionals.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n* **EA2 Diagnosis:**  Episodic Ataxia Type 2 is a complex condition, and the management can be highly individual.  It's good that Diamox (acetazolamide) and prednisone are providing *some* relief, even if it requires a \"titration\" during episodes.\n* **Diamox & Prednisone:** Your current regimen is a fairly common starting point for EA2. Diamox is often the initial treatment, aiming to reduce neuronal excitability. Prednisone's role is to dampen the inflammation that can contribute to attacks, but long-term steroid use has significant side effects.\n* **Prednisone Tapering Difficulty:** This is a major concern.  Your neurologist's push to taper prednisone despite your experience suggests he's weighing the risks of long-term steroid use against the benefits. However, the fact that it\u2019s the *most* effective part of your regimen is critical information. He should be working *with* you on this, not just pushing for it.\n* **4-AP Interest:**  4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) works by a different mechanism than Diamox and Prednisone \u2013 it enhances potassium channel blockade thereby improving nerve impulse conduction. For some EA2 patients, it can reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and potentially allow for lower steroid doses.  The fact you're considering it is logical.\n* **Neurologist's Reluctance:**  This is the biggest hurdle right now.  Neurologists can have varying comfort levels with specific medications, particularly those with a more complex risk/benefit profile.  It\u2019s not necessarily a \u201cbad\u201d thing that he\u2019s cautious, but the lack of *discussion* is problematic.\n* **Movement Disorder Clinic Barrier:**  The insurance issue is a major obstacle.  Access to specialized care is often hampered by these kinds of bureaucratic hurdles.\n\n\n\n**Addressing the Issues & Potential Steps**\n\nLet's tackle this in sections:\n\n**1.  Addressing the Neurologist Communication Breakdown**\n\n* **Directly Ask \"Why\":**  Schedule another appointment specifically to discuss 4-AP.  Don't just ask *if* you can try it, but *why* he's hesitant.  Specifically ask:\n    * \u201cI understand you have concerns about 4AP. Can you explain those to me specifically? What are the risks that weigh most heavily for *my* case?\u201d\n    * \u201cGiven that prednisone is currently the most effective part of my treatment, and I'm concerned about the long-term side effects, how would you propose we address managing my symptoms? I\u2019m interested in exploring all options.\u201d\n    * \u201cI've been researching 4-AP and understand it acts differently than my current medications.  Could we discuss how it might fit into a treatment plan, and what monitoring would be involved?\u201d\n* **Bring Research:**  Take well-sourced information (peer-reviewed articles, reputable EA2 foundations \u2013 see resources below). This demonstrates you've done your homework and aren't just casually requesting a medication.  *Don't present it as \"I've decided I need this,\" but as \"I've been learning about this, and I'd like to explore if it's appropriate for me.\"*\n* **Second Opinion:**  If you continue to feel dismissed, seek a second opinion from another neurologist, even if it requires travel (cost/benefit analysis).  A neurologist specializing in ataxia, specifically EA2, is ideal.\n* **Document EVERYTHING:**  Keep a detailed log of your symptoms, medication response, and conversations with your doctor. This is helpful for tracking your progress and providing a clear picture to other healthcare providers.\n\n**2.  Navigating the Movement Disorder Clinic/Specialist Access**\n\n* **Insurance Appeal:**  You're right to pursue a PA.  Get *everything* in writing from your neurologist supporting the medical necessity of seeing a specialist at that clinic.  The more detailed his justification, the better.\n* **Telehealth Possibilities:**  While the *ideal* is an in-person visit, inquire if the movement disorder clinic offers any telehealth appointments. This might be a temporary workaround while you wait for PA approval.\n* **Alternative Clinics:**  Research other movement disorder clinics, even if they're further away.  Some may have more flexible insurance arrangements.\n* **University Hospitals:**  Often, university-affiliated hospitals have financial assistance programs or can accept a wider range of insurance plans.\n\n\n\n**3.  Understanding 4-AP and its Considerations**\n\n* **Potential Benefits:**  As you know, 4-AP can improve nerve conduction and potentially reduce ataxia symptoms. For some EA2 patients, it can reduce the frequency or severity of attacks, and potentially lessen reliance on steroids.\n* **Potential Side Effects:** These are significant and why a cautious approach is important. Common side effects include paresthesias (tingling/numbness), muscle cramps, dizziness, and, more seriously, a risk of seizures.  Careful monitoring of dose is critical.\n* **Drug Interactions:**  4-AP can interact with other medications. Your neurologist needs a complete medication list.\n* **ECG Monitoring:** Baseline and regular ECGs (electrocardiograms) are essential, as 4-AP can affect heart rhythm.\n* **Start Low, Go Slow:**  If you *do* get a trial, the dosage must be started very low and increased gradually under close medical supervision.\n\n**4. Resources**\n\n* **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS):** [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/)  (Search for Episodic Ataxia)\n* **Ataxia-Telangiectasia Foundation:** [https://www.ataxiatelangiectasia.org/](https://www.ataxiatelangiectasia.org/) (Although focused on A-T, they have excellent information about ataxia in general)\n* **Rare Disease Organizations:** Search for EA2-specific or broader ataxia support groups.  They can provide valuable peer support and information. ([https://rarediseases.org/](https://rarediseases.org/) is a good starting point.)\n* **PubMed:** ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) Use this to search for peer reviewed research. Search terms like \u201cEpisodic Ataxia Type 2 4-Aminopyridine\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **You are your own advocate.** Don't be afraid to ask questions, express your concerns, and push for the care you deserve.\n* **Document everything.** Keep detailed records of symptoms, medications, and appointments.\n* **Be patient, but persistent.**  Finding the right treatment plan can take time and effort.\n\n\n\n\n**To help me tailor the information further, could you tell me:**\n\n*  **What is your general location (state/region)?**  This might help me suggest potential specialist centers.\n*  **What insurance do you have?** (Knowing the insurer can help identify potential PA challenges).\n* **Are there any other symptoms you experience besides ataxia?** (e.g., migraines, dizziness, weakness, etc.)\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope this information helps you navigate this challenging situation.  It's empowering to be informed and proactive in your healthcare.  Good luck, and please remember to discuss all this with your doctors."

        "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ? I feel flooded by these emotions, I cry.Then it took like 15 minutes to come back to normal, I am in a very confused state and go back to sleep.Any idea what was that ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds *very* unsettling, and it\u2019s good you\u2019re trying to understand what happened. What you describe is significantly beyond a typical sleep interruption or night terror. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, drawing on potential neurological explanations, psychological interpretations, and things you should consider doing.  I will also *strongly* recommend bringing this up with a medical professional at the end.\n\n**Understanding the Experience: Key Components**\n\nLet's break down the core elements of your experience:\n\n* **Sleep Onset/Wake Disruption:** Waking frequently, especially in the early morning hours (between 3-5 am), is common, often related to changes in sleep cycles and cortisol levels. However, the *way* you woke up is crucial.  It wasn't a normal consciousness-to-awake transition.\n* **Instinctual Dread/Panic:** The feeling of needing to *not* go back to sleep, almost like a survival instinct, is deeply concerning. This isn't typical sleep paralysis or a nightmare.\n* **Cognitive Distortion/Glitching:**  This is the most striking part. The inability to form complex thoughts, the sensation of \"burning paper,\" the lack of mental \"grip,\" and the feeling of thoughts erasing \u2013 these point to significant neurological disruption.  The metaphor of trying to hold water is incredibly apt.\n* **Absence of Inner Monologue:** The \"deafening silence\" of your internal voice is profoundly unusual.  For most people, that inner voice is a constant companion. Its absence suggests a severe disconnect in brain areas responsible for self-awareness and internal narrative.\n* **Depersonalization/Derealization:** The feeling that your thoughts weren't \"yours,\" lack of control over your thinking, and the chaotic, confused state are all hallmarks of depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself) and derealization (feeling detached from reality).\n* **Emotional Flooding and Return:** The later return of emotions, after initially feeling numb, combined with crying, suggests a breaking of a psychological dam.  The initial panic likely *suppressed* emotional processing, which then overwhelmed you when the cognitive barriers began to break down.\n* **Memory as an Anchor:** Your attempt to recall memories to ground yourself is a really intelligent self-preservation strategy.  It demonstrates an attempt to re-establish a sense of self and reality.\n\n\n\n**Potential Explanations (These are *possibilities,* not diagnoses!)**\n\nHere are several areas to consider. *It's important to note that I'm not a medical professional, and this requires expert evaluation.*\n\n1. **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations (Atypical Presentation):**  These usually happen *falling* asleep (hypnagogic) or *waking* up (hypnopompic). While you were awake and moving, the intensity & *nature* of your experience goes beyond typical hallucinations. They usually involve visual or auditory elements, not this profound cognitive disruption.\n\n2. **Complex Partial Seizure (Focal Seizure):** This is a *serious* consideration.  While often associated with physical symptoms (jerking, convulsions), complex partial seizures can manifest with altered consciousness, unusual sensations, depersonalization, and cognitive difficulties. The feeling of \"glitching\" and losing control align with this.  *Crucially, seizures can sometimes occur primarily during or after sleep.*  The emotional component could also be a part of the seizure activity.\n\n3. **Sleep Paralysis with Severe Cognitive Component:** While classic sleep paralysis involves immobility and often frightening hallucinations, it *could* be that you experienced an extremely rare and intense form. The instinctive fear, helplessness, and sense of dread are common, but the cognitive breakdown isn't usually so severe. \n\n4. **Dissociative Episode:**  Severe emotional distress (even if currently not consciously felt) can sometimes trigger dissociative episodes. These involve a disconnect from reality, feelings of unreality, and a sense of detachment from oneself.  The \"losing control\" aspect fits here.  However, the abrupt onset and specifically cognitive symptoms are less typical.\n\n5. **Transient Neurological Dysfunction:**  Sometimes, the brain can experience temporary disruptions in function.  This could be related to stress, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or other physiological factors. However, this is less likely to account for the highly specific and disturbing *quality* of your experience.\n\n6. **Neurological Migraine Aura (Unusual Presentation):** Some migraines are preceded by auras that aren't just visual. Cognitive aura \u2013 difficulty with speech, thinking, and concentration \u2013 can occur.  It's less common to have one manifest *during* wakefulness after a sleep disruption.\n\n\n\n**What you should DO IMMEDIATELY:**\n\n* **See a Doctor (Priority #1):**  **Please, make an appointment with your primary care physician as soon as possible.** Describe this experience in detail. They will likely refer you to a neurologist.  A neurologist can perform tests (EEG, MRI) to rule out seizure activity or other neurological conditions.  Don\u2019t downplay how frightening and disruptive this was.\n* **Keep a Detailed Sleep/Event Log:**  For the next few weeks, meticulously record:\n    * Bedtime and wake-up time\n    * Any disturbances during the night\n    * What you ate and drank before bed\n    * Stress levels\n    * Any medications you're taking\n    * *Specific details* of any similar episodes, even if milder.\n* **Avoid Triggers (if any are identified):**  If you suspect stress, caffeine, or alcohol might be contributing factors, try to minimize them.\n* **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene:**  Maintain a regular sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool\n* **Hydration & Diet:** Ensure you're adequately hydrated throughout the day and eating a balanced diet.\n* **Consider Therapy:**  A therapist (especially one experienced with trauma or dissociation) can help you process the emotional impact of this experience and develop coping strategies if it recurs.\n\n**Important Considerations for Explaining to the Doctor:**\n\n* **Be Precise:** Use the exact words you used here. The \"glitching,\" the \"burning paper,\" the \"deafening silence\" \u2013 these are important clues.\n* **Emphasize the Cognitive Component:**  This wasn't just a bad dream or a scary feeling. It was a profound disruption of *how you think*.\n* **Mention the Instinctive Fear:**  The fact that you felt you *had* to stay awake is significant.\n* **Don't Feel Embarrassed:** This is a medical concern, and your doctor needs accurate information.\n\n\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nWhat you experienced sounds genuinely frightening and potentially indicative of an underlying medical issue.  It\u2019s *crucial* to seek medical evaluation to rule out serious causes and get appropriate guidance. Don\u2019t try to self-diagnose.  Taking proactive steps is the best thing you can do for your health and peace of mind.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "(20F) 5\u20193\u201d 134lbs Drink/Smoke occasionally, every other day Zyrtec, south asianThis has been a daily issue for ~ a decade. I sleep and wake up about the same times. I pee 2-4 times in the night even if I don\u2019t drink after 9:30pm.Sometimes I can feel myself \u201cshutting down\u201d, or falling asleep and my body starting to paralyze. I hear crazy noises (exploding head syndrome). Mostly 1-3 times i am in a dream and cannot move my body at all. Feels like a magnet is preventing me from moving my head left to right. I\u2019m crying and screaming to lift a finger.It is so exhausting. I wake up fatigued and usually anxious. My brain fools me into thinking I\u2019m free the first time, but then I\u2019m paralyzed again. This is normal dreams + nightmares.I have major depression and anxiety. I heard that epilepsy can make you feel paralyzed in your sleep, and have trouble with memory. I have short-term memory loss past few years. I never have bruises or anything though. Please help!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly distressing and has been going on for a long time. It's good you're reaching out. You're right to be trying to understand what's happening and looking for answers. Let's break this down, address your concerns (especially about epilepsy), and map out what you should do next.  **I need to preface this with a very important disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  This information is for educational purposes only and should *not* be taken as a diagnosis. You *must* see a doctor for proper evaluation and treatment.**\n\n**Here's a thorough look at what you've described, potential causes, and recommendations:**\n\n**1. Understanding the Symptoms:**\n\n* **Nocturia (Frequent Nighttime Urination):**  Peeing 2-4 times a night, even with fluid restriction, is significant.  Possible causes include:\n    * **Diabetes Insipidus/Diabetes Mellitus:** Can cause increased urine production.\n    * **Overactive Bladder:**  Bladder signals to urinate even when not full.\n    * **Kidney Issues:** Can affect urine concentration.\n    * **Hormonal Imbalances:**  Especially estrogen levels.\n    * **Sleep Apnea:** Can directly contribute to nocturia. (See section 4)\n    * **Habit:**  Sometimes, it becomes a learned behavior.\n* **\"Shutting Down\" Feeling & Sleep Paralysis:** This is the core of your biggest concern.\n    * **Sleep Paralysis:**  This is *not* uncommon, and you've described it very accurately. It happens when you're in the transition between sleep and wakefulness (often during REM sleep). Your brain is partially awake, but your muscles are still paralyzed as a protective mechanism to prevent you from acting out your dreams. The feeling of a magnet restricting movement is classic.  The terror and anxiety associated with it are very typical.\n    * **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** The \"crazy noises\" (exploding head syndrome) and vivid dreams with paralysis likely fall into this category. These are hallucinations that occur as you're falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic).\n* **Fatigue & Anxiety:** These are likely both a result *of* the sleep disturbances *and* potentially contributing factors.  Your diagnosed depression and anxiety are highly relevant.\n* **Short-Term Memory Loss:**  This is concerning and *needs* to be investigated. It could be related to sleep deprivation, depression/anxiety, or something else.\n\n\n\n**2. Addressing Your Epilepsy Concern:**\n\nYou're right to consider epilepsy, as some forms *can* manifest with unusual symptoms like paralysis. *However*, several things make epilepsy less likely as the *sole* explanation here:\n\n* **No Convulsions/Seizures:** You don\u2019t mention any jerking, shaking, loss of consciousness during the day, or other typical seizure activity.\n* **Lack of Physical Trauma:** You haven't reported any injuries from falling or biting your tongue (common in some seizures).\n* **Specific Description of Paralysis:** The described paralysis during sleep paralysis is very different from the muscle contractions and loss of consciousness seen in most epileptic seizures.\n* **Epilepsy and Memory:** While some types of epilepsy can affect memory, it's usually accompanied by other seizure types.\n\n**That said, epilepsy *cannot* be ruled out without proper testing.**  It\u2019s good you\u2019re considering it. The doctor will need to assess.\n\n**3. Potential Contributing Factors & Conditions:**\n\n* **Depression & Anxiety:**  These significantly disrupt sleep patterns.  They can worsen sleep paralysis, increase nightmares, and contribute to fatigue and memory problems.\n* **Sleep Deprivation:**  The frequent awakenings (nocturia, sleep paralysis) are depriving you of restorative sleep, leading to fatigue, anxiety, and cognitive difficulties including memory issues.\n* **Stress:**  Chronic stress can exacerbate all of the above.\n* **Medication (Zyrtec):** While usually well-tolerated, some antihistamines *can* have side effects that impact sleep, although they rarely cause sleep paralysis directly. It's worth discussing with your doctor.\n* **Sleep Apnea:**  This is a *very* important consideration.  Sleep apnea (where you stop breathing intermittently during sleep) can cause frequent awakenings, fatigue, anxiety, and even mimic some of the sensations of sleep paralysis.  It's also linked to nocturia. Your age, weight, and potential for underlying inflammation (given South Asian background \u2013 there can be slightly higher predisposition to sleep apnea) make this worth investigating.\n* **Narcolepsy:** Although less likely, your description of \u201cshutting down\u201d and paralysis raises a very slight possibility.  This usually manifests with daytime sleepiness but can have atypical presentations.\n\n\n\n**4. What You *Must* Do \u2013 Action Plan:**\n\n1. **See a Doctor (Very Important):** Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician *as soon as possible*. Explain *all* of these symptoms in detail. Be thorough and honest.\n    * **Specifically tell them about the sleep paralysis episodes, the noises, the memory loss, and the frequency of nighttime urination.**\n2. **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):**  Your doctor will likely recommend a sleep study. This is *crucial*.  It will monitor your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and muscle movements during sleep.  This helps diagnose sleep apnea, rule out other sleep disorders, and potentially provide information relevant to the sleep paralysis.\n3. **Neurological Evaluation:** Ask for a referral to a neurologist, *especially* given your concern about epilepsy and the memory loss. They can perform an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check your brain's electrical activity.  They may also order an MRI of the brain.\n4. **Mental Health Assessment:** If you aren't already in therapy, seek it out.  Addressing your depression and anxiety is essential for improving your overall well-being and sleep. Medication adjustments might also be beneficial (discuss with your psychiatrist/doctor).\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** *While you're waiting for appointments*, improve your sleep hygiene:\n    * **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends.\n    * **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Warm bath, reading, or gentle stretching.\n    * **Dark, Quiet, Cool Bedroom:** Optimize your sleep environment.\n    * **Avoid Caffeine & Alcohol:** Especially in the evening.\n    * **Limit Screen Time:**  At least an hour before bed.\n    * **Regular Exercise:** But not right before bed.\n6. **Bladder Diary:**  Keep a detailed record of your fluid intake and urination times for a few days to share with your doctor.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding your immediate fear of Epilepsy:** While possible, the specifics of your symptoms steer away from classic seizures. Neurological testing will provide clarity.\n\n\n**To help your doctor, consider keeping a sleep diary for a week or two. Record:**\n\n* Time you went to bed\n* Time you fell asleep (estimate)\n* Number of times you woke up during the night\n* What you did when you woke up (e.g., went to the bathroom)\n* Time you woke up in the morning\n* How rested you felt\n* Any dreams or sleep paralysis episodes (describe in detail)\n\nThis is a complex situation, but it\u2019s very good you\u2019re trying to find answers. Don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask questions. You deserve to feel better.\n\n\n\n**Again, *please* see a doctor. This is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**"

        "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good question and it\u2019s smart of you to be proactive about understanding what's going on with your blood tests, especially given your history and the change in medications.  It's frustrating when doctors don't give clear answers, so let's break down what's likely happening and how it might play out.  I\u2019ll address this in sections, covering the reasons, likely tests, and what the results might mean.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**\n\n**1. Why the Change in Blood Test Approach?**\n\nYou're right to connect the change in medications to the shift in blood test focus.  Here's why:\n\n*   **Tegretol (Carbamazepine) and Liver Toxicity:** Tegretol is known to sometimes cause liver problems, hence the Liver Function Tests (LFTs). Even if the seizures were the primary reason for the switch, the liver issues were clearly a factor.\n*   **Keppra (Levetiracetam) and Topamax (Topiramate) \u2013 Kidney Focus:**  Both Keppra and Topamax are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. This means your kidneys have to work harder to clear these drugs from your system.  This puts a strain on them, and it\u2019s essential to monitor kidney function.\n*   **Potential for Kidney Problems:**  Topamax, in particular, has a higher risk of kidney stone formation. Keppra can, less commonly, have effects on kidney function, too.  Monitoring allows doctors to catch any issues early.\n*   **Therapeutic Drug Levels \u2013 Less Critical:** While therapeutic drug levels (checking the amount of medication in your blood) *can* be useful for some AEDs, they aren't always routinely done with Keppra or Topamax.  Their effects are less directly tied to a precise blood concentration. (Although they *can* be checked, it's less common).\n\n\n\n**2. Likely Blood Tests \u2013 What to Expect**\n\nYou're spot on in thinking a Renal Panel is highly probable.  Here\u2019s a breakdown of what tests you can reasonably expect, and why:\n\n*   **Renal Panel (Kidney Function Tests):**  This is *very* likely. It will include:\n    *   **Creatinine:** This measures a waste product from muscle activity that healthy kidneys filter out of the blood.  High levels indicate the kidneys aren't working as well.\n    *   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** Another waste product that kidneys remove.  Similar to creatinine, high levels suggest kidney issues.\n    *   **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR):** This is calculated from creatinine, age, sex, and other factors to estimate how well your kidneys are filtering blood.  It's a key indicator of overall kidney function.\n    *   **Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Bicarbonate):**  Kidney function affects electrolyte balance. Imbalances can impact seizure control and overall health.\n*   **LFTs (Liver Function Tests):**  Since you've had a history with liver issues triggered by previous medication, doctors may decide to continue monitoring your liver *periodically* even though the new meds aren\u2019t as directly liver-toxic.  They might do this less frequently than the renal panel, though.\n*   **CBC/FBC (Complete Blood Count/Full Blood Count):** This is a general health check-up that assesses your overall blood health. It's relatively standard and helps rule out other issues. They may continue this.\n*   **Urine Analysis:** This is often done alongside a renal panel. It can detect protein in the urine (a sign of kidney damage), blood in the urine (potentially from kidney stones), and other abnormalities.\n*   **Electrolytes (Specifically Calcium, Phosphate, Uric Acid):** Topiramate (Topamax) can increase the risk of kidney stones. These tests help evaluate your risk.\n\n**3. How This Might Play Out \u2013 A Timeline**\n\nHere's a likely scenario, but remember, this is a generalization, and your doctor's approach will be individualised:\n\n*   **Initial, Frequent Monitoring (First 3-6 Months):** Expect blood tests every 1-3 months.  This is to establish a baseline of your kidney function on the new medications and check for any rapid changes. LFTs might be included in this phase, but could become less frequent.\n*   **Stable Phase (6 Months - 1 Year):** If your kidney function remains stable, the frequency might decrease to every 6 months.  They may focus primarily on the renal panel and urine analysis. LFT's might only be done annually.\n*   **Long-Term Monitoring (Beyond 1 Year):**  If everything continues to be stable, testing may become annual, or even less frequent if your doctor is very confident. However, they *will* likely increase testing again if you:\n    *   Start taking any new medications.\n    *   Develop new medical conditions (like high blood pressure or diabetes, which affect kidneys).\n    *   Report any symptoms suggesting kidney problems (e.g., swelling in ankles, changes in urination).\n    *   Experience a change in seizure patterns.\n\n**4.  What to Ask Your Doctor (Again!)**\n\nIt's essential to get clarity.  Here are some specific questions to ask:\n\n*   \u201cNow that I\u2019m on Keppra and Topamax, will I be getting a renal panel with each blood test?\u201d\n*   \u201cWill you continue to monitor my liver function? If so, how often?\u201d\n*   \u201cWhat specific values will you be looking at in the tests, and what would be considered concerning?\u201d\n*   \"What sort of symptoms should I be aware of that might indicate my kidneys aren't coping?\" (e.g., swelling, changes in urine)\n*   \"If my kidney function does change, what are the potential next steps?\"\n*   \"Are there any lifestyle changes I should make (hydration, diet) to support my kidney health while on these medications?\"\n\n\n\n**5.  Important Lifestyle Considerations**\n\n*   **Hydration:** Drink *plenty* of water throughout the day. This helps your kidneys flush out waste and reduces the risk of kidney stones.\n*   **Diet:** Avoid a diet high in salt and processed foods, as they can strain the kidneys.\n*   **Avoid NSAIDs:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like ibuprofen and naproxen) can be hard on the kidneys, especially when combined with certain medications. Talk to your doctor before taking them.\n*   **Report Symptoms:**  Don\u2019t hesitate to report any unusual symptoms to your doctor.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your specific situation and medical history are unique, and a doctor can provide personalized guidance based on your needs.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed explanation is helpful!  Don\u2019t hesitate to ask if you have any other questions.  It's good you're taking an active role in your healthcare."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, let's break down your situation. You have a complex medical history with a lot going on, and it's good you're being proactive about noticing new symptoms. Here's a comprehensive response, covering everything from the likely causes of your eye issue to who you should see, and how it might relate to your overall health.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end because this is *not* medical advice.**\n\n**1. Understanding Your Current Medical Landscape**\n\n*   **Diagnoses:** Bipolar 1 Disorder, Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These conditions are all interconnected and can influence each other.\n*   **Medications:** A significant medication list:\n    *   **Sertraline (200mg):** SSRI antidepressant/anti-anxiety.\n    *   **Topamax (200mg):** Anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer. Commonly used for epilepsy and migraine prevention.\n    *   **Abilify (2x 30mg = 60mg):** Atypical antipsychotic. Used for bipolar disorder, sometimes as an adjunct for depression.\n    *   **Risperidone (3mg):** Atypical antipsychotic.  Also used for bipolar disorder and psychosis.\n    *   **Clonidine (100mcg):** Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Used for various conditions, including anxiety, ADHD, and sometimes to help with tics or sleep.\n    *   **Testogel (2 pumps):** Testosterone replacement therapy.\n    *   **Somac (40mg):** Proton pump inhibitor for stomach acid reduction.\n    *   **Vitamin D (1000 IU):** Supplement for vitamin D deficiency.\n*   **Seizure History:** Confirmed partial seizures.  You *suspect* myoclonic seizures. This is important to clarify.\n*   **Physical Stats:** 148cm (4'10\"), 90kg (198lbs).  Body Mass Index (BMI) indicates obesity. Obesity can sometimes affect medication metabolism and contribute to other health issues.\n*   **New Symptom:** Left eye sticking closed for ~10 seconds several times a day for the past 2 months.\n\n\n\n**2.  Possible Causes of Your Eye Sticking/Closing (Blepharospasm)**\n\nYou're right to consider blepharospasm. Here's a breakdown of potential causes:\n\n*   **Benign Essential Blepharospasm:** This is the most common cause. It's a focal dystonia \u2013 an involuntary muscle contraction.  The cause is often unknown, but stress, fatigue, and caffeine can worsen it.\n*   **Hemifacial Spasm:**  Usually caused by a blood vessel compressing a facial nerve. Often affects one side of the face, including the eye.\n*   **Dry Eye:**  Severe dry eye can sometimes cause irritation that leads to involuntary blinking or eyelid closure.\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** *This is a crucial area to consider given your medication list*.  Several of your meds *can* have neurological side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) which can manifest as muscle spasms or dystonias.  Specifically:\n    *   **Antipsychotics (Abilify, Risperidone):**  These are known for potential EPS, including akathisia (restlessness) and dystonias (involuntary muscle contractions).  The eye muscles can be affected.\n    *   **Topamax:** While primarily an anticonvulsant, Topamax can also have neurological side effects.\n*   **Epilepsy-Related:**  Focal seizures originating in certain parts of the brain can *absolutely* manifest as eyelid movements or spasms.  Even partial seizures can have atypical presentations.  What you describe *could* be a type of focal seizure, even if it doesn\u2019t fit your previous seizure patterns.\n*   **Other Neurological Conditions:**  Less common, but other neurological conditions could play a role.\n\n\n\n**3.  Is it related to your Epilepsy?**\n\nIt's *possible* that your eye sticking is related to your epilepsy, even if your partial seizures manifest differently. Here's why:\n\n*   **Focal Onset:** If the seizures are originating in parts of the brain that control facial muscles or eye movement, this could explain the symptom.  Temporal lobe epilepsy *can* spread to affect other brain areas.\n*   **Atypical Presentation:** Seizures don\u2019t always look the same.  They can be subtle and manifest in unexpected ways. The myoclonic seizures you suspect support this possibility.\n*    **Drug-Induced:**  Your anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and other medications could be interacting or causing side effects that mimic or exacerbate seizure activity.\n\n**4.  Who Should You See? \u2013 And Why. *This is Important.***\n\n**You should see your *Neurologist* first.**\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*   **Epilepsy Expertise:**  Your neurologist is the expert on your epilepsy. They understand your seizure type, brain activity (if you've had an EEG), and medication regimen.  They are best equipped to determine if this new symptom is seizure-related.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:**  They can perform a neurological exam to rule out other causes, and they can order further testing (like an EEG) if needed, to help determine the cause.\n*   **Medication Review:**  They are the best person to assess whether your medications could be contributing to the problem (EPS, or even altered seizure control). *Do not adjust your medications on your own*.\n*    **Myoclonic Seizure Evaluation:** Discussing your suspicion of myoclonic seizures is important. The neurologist can guide you on ways to record these events, and potentially order a video EEG to catch them.\n\n\n\n\n**Why *not* the GP first?**\n\nWhile your GP is important for overall health, they likely don't have the specialized knowledge of epilepsy and neurological movement disorders to properly evaluate this symptom. Your GP could certainly *refer* you to a neurologist, but starting with the specialist is more efficient.\n\n\n\n**5. What to Tell Your Neurologist**\n\nBe *very* detailed when you describe the symptom:\n\n*   **Frequency:** How many times a day does it happen?\n*   **Duration:** How long does each episode last? (You said ~10 seconds, that's good)\n*   **Triggers:** Does anything seem to bring it on? (Stress, fatigue, specific activities)\n*   **Associated Symptoms:** Do you experience anything *else* during these episodes? (e.g., tingling, weakness, visual disturbances, a strange sensation before it starts, awareness of odd smells or tastes).\n*   **Impact:** Does it interfere with your daily activities?\n*   **Record it:** If possible, *video* an episode. This is incredibly helpful for the neurologist.\n*   **Medication List:** Bring a complete, up-to-date list of *all* your medications, including dosages.\n*   **Seizure Diary:** If you keep one, bring it. If not, start one now and bring it to your appointment.\n\n\n**6. Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Treat:** Do not attempt to adjust your medications yourself.\n*    **BMI:** Discuss your weight with your doctor. Weight management may benefit your overall health and potentially your epilepsy control.\n*   **Stress Management:**  Given your diagnoses, stress management techniques (therapy, mindfulness, exercise) are crucial.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* understandably stressful situation. You're doing the right thing by being proactive, and it's smart to explore all avenues, including seeking a faster EEG. Let's break down your questions about 23andMe and TSC, and I'll also give some broader context about genetic testing and infantile spasms.  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice, but I can provide information.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**Regarding 23andMe and Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC): Can it detect the mutations?**\n\nThis is a nuanced question. **It *can* detect *some* of the mutations that cause TSC, but absolutely not all.** Here\u2019s a detailed explanation:\n\n*   **TSC is caused by mutations in two genes: *TSC1* and *TSC2*.**  These are relatively large genes, and mutations can occur at many different points within them.\n*   **23andMe's genotyping array doesn't sequence the *entire* *TSC1* and *TSC2* genes.**  It looks for a specific set of common variations (SNPs \u2013 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms).  Think of it like looking for specific pieces of a puzzle. If those pieces aren\u2019t the ones 23andMe tests for, it won't find the mutation.  There are many, many possible mutations within these genes that 23andMe *won't* detect.\n*   **23andMe does include some SNPs within *TSC1* and *TSC2* that are associated with TSC.** If your son happens to have a common, known mutation that 23andMe tests for, it *might* flag it as increasing risk. However, a negative result does *not* rule out TSC.\n*   **Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS):**  23andMe might identify a variant in *TSC1* or *TSC2* that isn't well understood. These are called VUS and don't definitively mean your son has, or will develop, TSC.\n*   **De Novo Mutations:** Many cases of TSC are *de novo*, meaning the mutation occurred spontaneously in the egg or sperm, and is not inherited from a parent.  23andMe tests primarily look for inherited variants. A de novo mutation might not be detectable even in a parent\u2019s 23andMe results.\n\n**In short: 23andMe should *not* be relied upon to determine whether or not your son has TSC.  It could offer a hint, but a negative result is meaningless in terms of ruling it out.**\n\n\n\n**Why a Dedicated TSC Genetic Test is Necessary:**\n\nIf there is any clinical suspicion of TSC (even if currently asymptomatic), a proper genetic test is required. This typically involves:\n\n*   **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES):** This sequences all the protein-coding regions of the genome, providing a comprehensive look at *TSC1* and *TSC2*.\n*   **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS):** This sequences the entire genome, including non-coding regions, and is the most comprehensive, but also the most expensive.\n*   **Targeted Gene Sequencing:** Specifically focuses on *TSC1* and *TSC2* genes.\n\nThese tests are ordered by a clinical geneticist and analyzed by a genetics lab.\n\n\n\n\n**Infantile Spasms & West Syndrome \u2013 Your Concern is Valid**\n\nYou are absolutely right to be proactive.  Infantile spasms are strongly associated with West syndrome, which is a severe form of epilepsy in infancy. The key points:\n\n*   **Early Diagnosis is Crucial:** The sooner treatment (usually high-dose corticosteroids or vigabatrin) is started, the better the chances of controlling the spasms and minimizing long-term developmental impact.\n*   **TSC as a Cause:** TSC is one of the most common underlying causes of West syndrome (along with genetic mutations and brain malformations).  That\u2019s why your concern about TSC is well-founded. Even if he doesn\u2019t show skin lesions (ash leaf spots, facial angiofibromas) or other signs *now*, they can develop later.\n*   **EEG is Essential:** The EEG is crucial to confirm the characteristic hypsarrhythmia pattern associated with West syndrome.  Your urgency in getting this done is perfectly justified.\n\n\n\n\n**Going to the US for an EEG \u2013 Thoughts:**\n\n*   **Good Idea:**  If you can access a faster EEG evaluation in the US, this is a reasonable course of action, given the urgency.\n*   **Find a Specialist:**  Look for a pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy and infantile spasms.  Ideally, a center with experience in TSC is best.\n*   **Bring Records:** Take all of your son's medical records (including the ER report and ultrasound) with you.\n*   **Insurance/Cost:**  You've already considered the cost, which is good.  Be prepared for potentially significant out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   Don't rely on 23andMe to determine if your son has TSC.\n*   Prioritize getting a prompt and thorough EEG.\n*   Consider seeking specialized care in the US if it means a faster diagnosis and treatment plan.\n*   If TSC is suspected, advocate for comprehensive genetic testing.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation, and it's good you've already sought emergency medical attention previously. You are right to be proactive in trying to understand what's going on. Let's break down your symptoms and the possibilities, including catamenial epilepsy, but also considering other possibilities.  **Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This information is for general knowledge and discussion. You *must* discuss this with your doctor, preferably a neurologist, and potentially a gynecologist.  This is especially important given the episodes of potential loss of consciousness and breathing difficulties.\n\n**Let's Organize Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Timing:** Strongly linked to your menstrual cycle.  This is the biggest clue.\n*   **Back Tightness:** Often precedes other symptoms. Could be muscular tension related to the cycle, or could be a very early warning sign connected to neurological activity.\n*   **\"Waves\" in Head:** This is a very unusual description and is concerning.  It's not typical migraine aura. It sounds like some kind of altered sensory perception, possibly neurological.\n*   **Tingling (Paresthesia):**  Arms and legs, resembling Restless Leg Syndrome. This can be a symptom of neurological issues, electrolyte imbalances, or anxiety/stress.\n*   **Cardiac Sensations:**  \"Weird feeling\" heart, and episodes of interrupted breathing. This is *very* concerning and needs careful evaluation. Even with a normal EKG, subtle cardiac issues or vagal nerve involvement could be contributing.\n*   **Breathing Pauses (Apnea/Hypopnea):** The sensation of having to \"remember\" to breathe is alarming and suggests possible central (brain-related) sleep apnea or another neurological influence on respiratory control.\n*   **Brief Loss of Consciousness/Confusion:** This is a critical symptom.  Even if you feel it's \"just a few moments,\" it warrants investigation.\n*   **Positive Response to Ativan:** The dramatic relief with Ativan is a very important clue, strongly suggesting a neurological component, potentially involving anxiety or seizure activity.\n* **Post-Event Amnesia/Automatisms:** The groaning/mumbling you're *told* you do but don't remember is a key feature of many seizure types.\n* **Esophageal Tear/Vomiting Blood:**  This is a very serious complication, likely related to the severe nausea/vomiting from previous episodes.\n\n\n\n**Could This Be Catamenial Epilepsy?**\n\nCatamenial epilepsy (CE) is a real phenomenon where seizures occur in relation to the menstrual cycle. Here's how your symptoms align and don't align:\n\n*   **Alignment:** The strong cyclical timing is the biggest indicator.  Fluctuations in hormones (especially estrogen) can lower the seizure threshold in susceptible individuals.\n*   **Alignment:** The positive response to Ativan (a benzodiazepine) is consistent with CE, as benzodiazepines are often used to control seizures.\n*   **Alignment:** Some forms of partial seizure can present with atypical aura experiences like your \u201cwave\u201d sensation.\n*   **Non-Alignment:**  Traditionally, CE is characterized by *convulsive* seizures (though not always). Your symptoms seem more complex, involving autonomic (heart, breathing), sensory (tingling), and potentially altered consciousness, not just shaking.\n* **Non-Alignment:** Lack of family history doesn't rule it out. Most epilepsies are not directly inherited.\n\n**However, it's important to note:** CE is often a diagnosis *of exclusion*. This means doctors rule out other causes first.\n\n\n\n**Other Possibilities to Consider (These are NOT mutually exclusive \u2013 you could have a combination of factors):**\n\n1.  **Migraine with Neurological Aura:**  Atypical migraine can have very complex auras, including sensory disturbances, weakness, and even temporary speech problems.  The headache itself isn't always prominent.  However, the \"waves\" you describe are less typical.\n2.  **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a condition where the nervous system isn't functioning correctly, causing a range of neurological symptoms.  It's *not* a psychological illness, but often triggered by stress or physical conditions.  The cyclical nature in your case *could* relate to hormonal fluctuations acting as a trigger. The responsiveness to Ativan would fit.\n3. **Menstrual Migraine:** A subtype of migraine specifically tied to the menstrual cycle.\n4.  **Vasovagal Syncope/Dysreflexia:** This involves a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to fainting. It can be triggered by pain, stress, or hormonal changes.  The breathing pauses could be part of this.  However, it doesn't usually cause the \"waves\" or tingling.\n5. **Cyclical Autonomic Dysfunction:** The symptoms you describe suggest possible fluctuations in autonomic nervous system, and your cycle may be a trigger.\n6.  **Underlying Cardiac Condition:** Even with a normal EKG, intermittent arrhythmias or subtle heart issues could be contributing to the palpitations and breathing pauses.  A Holter monitor (continuous EKG recording) or an echocardiogram might be helpful.\n7. **Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder:** The feeling of forgetting to breathe could be indicative of central sleep apnea or hypopnea.\n\n\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Neurologist Consultation:** *This is the most important step.* Find a neurologist experienced in epilepsy and complex neurological conditions. Bring a detailed log of your symptoms (timing, duration, severity, what helps, what makes it worse).\n2.  **Gynecological Evaluation:**  Discuss your symptoms with your gynecologist, specifically the strong link to your cycle.  They can assess hormone levels and discuss potential management strategies.\n3.  **Extended EEG:** A routine EEG in the doctor's office might not capture the events.  You may need a 24-48 hour or even longer EEG monitoring, *especially* timed to coincide with your menstrual cycle.  Home EEG monitoring is also becoming more available.\n4.  **Cardiac Workup:** Consider a Holter monitor and echocardiogram to evaluate heart function.\n5.  **Sleep Study:** A polysomnogram (sleep study) can assess for sleep apnea and other sleep disorders.\n6.  **Consider a Video-EEG:** If you have an episode while being monitored with both EEG and video recording, it can visually correlate brain activity with your symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding Your Experience with Ativan:**\n\nThe fact that Ativan provides immediate relief is a strong signal. It suggests that the underlying mechanism is likely related to heightened neuronal excitability. However, Ativan is not a long-term solution.\n\n\n\n**Important Reminder:**  Don't self-diagnose. The overlap between these conditions can be significant, and accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by qualified medical professionals.  Advocate for yourself, be persistent in seeking answers, and don't be afraid to get second opinions.\n\nYou've already taken the right first steps by recognizing the pattern and seeking medical attention.  Keep detailed records, and work closely with your healthcare team to get to the bottom of this. Good luck."

Thanks!TLDR: swollen potential lymph node in the occipital area at the base of skull. very painful. have a headache. concerned about infection but no fever.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds really unpleasant and understandably concerning, especially with your existing health conditions. Let's break this down, considering everything you've described.  I'm an AI and cannot give medical advice, but I can offer some insights to help you think through this and formulate questions for a doctor.\n\n**Here's a categorized look at the possible factors, and what might be happening, followed by a firm recommendation about seeking medical attention.  I'll also highlight things to tell your doctor.**\n\n**1. Potential Causes & Connections (and what's *less* likely)**\n\n*   **Occipital Lymph Node & Painful Lump:** This is the biggest concern you\u2019ve identified.\n    *   **Reactive Lymph Node:**  This is the *most likely* scenario. Lymph nodes swell when fighting off something \u2013 viral or bacterial. Just because you *don\u2019t* have a fever doesn\u2019t rule out infection.  Early stages of infection, or localized infections, can present without fever.  Your cystic acne on the right cheek *could* be the source, even if it seems distant.  Skin infections can sometimes cause regional lymph node swelling.\n    *   **Muscle Strain/Trigger Point Referral:** The right shoulder pain is *potentially* relevant.  Tight muscles in the neck and shoulder can refer pain to the base of the skull and sometimes feel like a 'lump.' However, the extreme tenderness of the node makes this less likely as the sole cause.\n    *   **Cervical Spine Issue:** While less likely with the accompanying lump, pain at the base of the skull can come from problems in the cervical spine (neck).\n    *   **Less Likely (but should be considered by a doctor):**  While rare, persistent and very painful lymph nodes warrant ruling out other possibilities.\n\n*   **Migraine:** The migraine is significant.\n    *   **Breakthrough Migraine:** Despite Aimovig, breakthrough migraines can occur.  Stress from packing/lifting, changes in routine, or even the body's response to fighting off something could trigger it.\n    *   **Rebound Headache:**  Frequent headaches despite medication *sometimes* (but not always) point to a rebound effect. This is something to discuss with your neurologist.\n    *   **Headache Worsened by Position:** The improvement with upright posture is interesting. It can suggest certain types of headache, but doesn't pinpoint the cause.\n\n*   **Your Medications:**\n    *   **Aptiom (Levetiracetam):**  Starting a new epilepsy medication *can* have side effects. While common side effects are often fatigue, mood changes, and dizziness, medication-induced inflammation leading to lymph node issues is less common but possible.  Two weeks is relatively early; side effects can evolve.\n    *   **Junel FE/Birth Control:**  Generally less likely to be a direct cause of these symptoms, but hormonal fluctuations can sometimes contribute to headaches.\n    *   **Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine):**  Less likely to be directly linked, but also worth mentioning to your doctor.\n\n*   **Packing/Lifting:**  The shoulder pain and potential muscle strain are probably real, but they may be a 'distractor' from the more concerning lymph node and headache.\n\n**2.  Why the Lack of Fever Doesn't Rule Out Infection**\n\n*   **Localized Infection:** The infection source (like the acne) might be contained and not cause a systemic (whole-body) fever.\n*   **Early Stage:** You might be in the very early stages of an infection. Your body hasn't fully mounted an immune response yet.\n*   **Your Immune System:**  Due to your epilepsy meds and other medical conditions, your immune system might function differently and not produce a typical fever response. This is speculative, but important to discuss with your doctor.\n\n\n\n**3.  Should You Be Concerned? YES. And Seek Medical Attention.**\n\nGiven your medical history (epilepsy, migraines, endometriosis) *and* the combination of a very painful, swollen lymph node, a breakthrough migraine, and new medication (Aptiom), you absolutely should be evaluated by a medical professional. *Do not try to self-diagnose or wait to see if it gets better on its own.*\n\n**4. What to Tell Your Doctor (Important!).  Write these down to take with you.**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:**  Start with the shoulder pain (when it started, how it progressed). Then the lymph node discovery, then the migraine.\n*   **Pain Description:**  Be specific about the pain:\n    *   *Lymph Node Pain:*  \"The pain is sharp, constant, and made significantly worse by palpation or even brushing my hair.\"\n    *   *Headache Pain:* \"It started as X and progressed to Y, radiating to Z. It's a X/10 pain and is better when I sit up.\"\n*   **Medication List:** *Bring a complete list of all your medications,* including dosages, and *when* you started Aptiom.\n*   **Medical History:**  Remind them of your epilepsy, migraines, and endometriosis.\n*   **Acne:**  Mention the painful cystic acne on your cheek - where it is, when it started, and any signs of worsening.\n*   **Negative Covid Test:**  Good to tell them you\u2019ve ruled that out.\n*   **Concerning Factors:** *Emphasize* the combination of symptoms and the extreme pain of the lymph node.  Say you are concerned about a possible infection or a reaction to the new medication.\n\n\n\n\n**Who to See?**\n\n* **Primary Care Physician (PCP):** A good first step, *especially* if you suspect an infection or medication side effect. They can do a physical exam and potentially order blood work.\n* **Neurologist:** If the headache is the dominant symptom, and especially if you're concerned about the migraine being different than usual, contacting your neurologist is a good idea.  However, because of the lymph node concern, I still recommend starting with your PCP.\n\n**Don't hesitate to seek care sooner if:**\n\n*   The pain gets significantly worse.\n*   You develop a fever.\n*   You experience any neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, numbness, vision changes, confusion).\n*   The lymph node rapidly increases in size.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* concerning and complex presentation. You're right to be freaked out, and it's good you got her to the hospital. You've provided a lot of helpful details. Here's a breakdown of possible explanations, acknowledging that I'm *not* a doctor and this is purely speculation based on the information provided \u2013 a neurologist's assessment is absolutely critical, which you've already sought:\n\n**Let's break down the components and then consider potential overarching causes:**\n\n* **Epilepsy (newly diagnosed):** The initial diagnosis is the foundation here. The seizures themselves are the primary problem.\n* **Binge-Purge-Restrict Cycle (Suspected ED):** This is HUGE. Eating disorders profoundly impact electrolyte balance, brain function, and overall health. This is a major factor to consider.\n* **Depression & Sleep Medication:**  The neurologist's initial thought about the depression meds being a trigger is valid, but the new behaviors raise questions about whether the current medication is sufficient or if it's interacting with something else.\n* **The Third-Person Speech, Accent Change, Childlike Behavior, & Degrading Comments:** This constellation of symptoms is *highly* unusual and points beyond a \"typical\" seizure presentation. The fact that it's so distinct and... personalized (the \"Kim\" comments) is particularly striking.\n* **Random Writing:** This is also very atypical post-seizure.  It suggests a significant disruption of higher cognitive function.\n* **Isolation:** The fact she's been with her parents for 3 months and hasn't had visitors makes illicit drug use less likely, but doesn't entirely rule it out.  She could have had something stockpiled.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes & Things the Neurologist will be considering:**\n\nHere's a tiered approach, starting with the most likely/immediate concerns, and moving towards less common but potentially serious possibilities. I'll also categorize it by likelihood based on how you described it.\n\n**1. Complex Partial/Focal-to-Bilaterial Seizures (High Likelihood \u2013 needs investigation related to this)**\n\n*   **What it is:**  Epilepsy isn\u2019t just grand mal/tonic-clonic seizures (full body shaking). Many seizures are *focal*, starting in one part of the brain. These can manifest in varied ways, including alterations in behavior, sensations, emotions, and awareness. The progression to a generalized (full body shaking) seizure is common.\n*   **Why it fits:** The altered speech (3rd person, accent), childlike behavior, and emotional content (degrading comments) *strongly* suggest a complex focal seizure affecting areas of the brain involved in personality, language, and emotional regulation. The progression to a generalized seizure is consistent with this.  If the affected area spreads, it can cause a generalized seizure.\n*   **What needs to be looked at:**  The neurologist needs to determine *where* in the brain the seizures are originating. More detailed EEG (potentially with video monitoring) and MRI are crucial.\n\n**2. Non-Epileptic Psychogenic (Functional) Neurological Disorder (High Likelihood \u2013 needs consideration!)**\n*   **What it is:** These are symptoms that outwardly *look* like neurological problems (like seizures or speech changes) but don't have an underlying identifiable neurological cause. They are often triggered or exacerbated by psychological stress, trauma, or underlying mental health conditions.\n*   **Why it fits :** The *highly* unusual and emotionally charged nature of the 3rd person speech and degrading comments is suggestive here. The link to previously diagnosed depression AND the suspected eating disorder makes this more probable. The shift in accent and child-like behavior is even more unusual. It\u2019s important to state this is *not* someone faking, it\u2019s an involuntary neurological malfunction caused by emotional distress.\n*   **What needs to be looked at:** This diagnosis is challenging. The neurologist may consider continuous EEG monitoring to see if the events correlate with typical seizure activity. A thorough psychological evaluation is essential.\n\n**3. Metabolic Disturbances (Medium Likelihood \u2013 VERY important to rule out)**\n\n*   **What it is:** The binge-purge cycle significantly disrupts electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium). Severe imbalances can trigger seizures, and *also* cause encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) leading to altered mental status, confusion, and strange behavior.  The eating disorder is a massive red flag here.\n*   **Why it fits:**  The recent seizure activity, combined with a history of a potentially severe eating disorder, makes very low/high potassium/sodium/electrolyte imbalances a strong possibility.\n*   **What needs to be looked at:**  The blood tests already ordered are critical for checking electrolyte levels, kidney function, liver function, and blood glucose.\n\n**4. Drug Interaction/Side Effect (Medium Likelihood)**\n\n*   **What it is:** It's good the neurologist considered the depression medication, but even other medications (or interactions between them) can contribute.\n*   **Why it fits:** Medication side effects *can* cause unusual neurological symptoms.\n*   **What needs to be looked at:** A complete medication review is necessary, including dosages and timing. \n\n**5. Less Common, but Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Underlying Brain Structural Problem:**  The CT scan is a good first step to rule out things like tumors, lesions, or other structural abnormalities. An MRI would offer much more detail.\n*   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**  This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the brain. It can cause seizures and psychiatric symptoms.\n*   **Infection:** Though less likely given the stability, an infection affecting the brain (encephalitis) needs to be ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n*   **Trust the Medical Team:** You're doing the right thing by getting her to the hospital and following their lead.\n*   **Advocate for Thorough Investigation:**  Push for detailed EEG (video EEG is best), and MRI of the brain. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions.\n*   **Provide a Complete History:** Thoroughly and honestly inform the neurologist about the eating disorder (even if she's reluctant to acknowledge it), all medications (including dosages and timing), and the specifics of the unusual behaviors you observed.\n*   **Be Patient:**  It may take time to get a clear diagnosis.  These cases can be complex.\n* **Consider a psychiatric consultation alongside the neurological assessment.**\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\nI sincerely hope your sister-in-law gets the help she needs. This sounds like a very stressful situation for everyone.  \n\n\n\n"

        "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can\u2019t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can\u2019t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it\u2019s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can\u2019t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* concerning and complex case. It sounds incredibly distressing for both of you. The fact that multiple doctors haven't been able to pinpoint a cause despite extensive (though potentially incomplete, see below) testing is alarming. The sudden onset and severity of the symptoms, coupled with the positional worsening, are particularly worrying. Here's a breakdown of my thoughts, based on the information provided, and suggestions for avenues to explore.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response.**\n\n**Key Concerns & Possible Considerations:**\n\n* **Positional Intolerance (Orthostatic Intolerance):** The significant worsening of symptoms upon standing is a major clue. This suggests something affecting cerebral blood flow or intracranial pressure, *or* a systemic issue impacting blood volume/regulation.\n* **Neurological Symptoms:**  Headaches (stabbing pain), nausea/vomiting, distorted balance, confusion, and anisocoria (pupil inequality) point strongly to a neurological issue, despite the normal MRI.  The anisocoria, even if intermittent, is especially concerning.\n* **Liver Involvement (Past & Potential):** The elevated ALT/AST (even if now normalized) and narrow bile ducts, along with low ceruloplasmin and carnitine, create a pattern of possible liver dysfunction.\n* **Medication Withdrawal:**  While your partner felt medications worsened things, *abruptly* stopping them can sometimes precipitate withdrawal symptoms that mimic or exacerbate underlying conditions. (This is less likely the sole cause, given the severity and duration.)\n* **The Nitroglycerin Patch:**  This is very important.  Nitroglycerin causes vasodilation. While used for cardiac conditions, *it can significantly lower blood pressure*. This could exacerbate positional intolerance and contribute to headache/neurological symptoms, especially in someone with a compromised ability to regulate blood pressure. This needs to be discussed with the prescribing physician *immediately*.\n* **Wilsons Disease & Porphyria:**  Appropriate to be considering these, given the symptoms and initial lab findings.  Getting these tests done is crucial.\n\n\n\n**Here's a more detailed breakdown, categorized by potential problem areas, and suggestions for further investigation.  I will rank these roughly by the urgency I perceive, based on your description:**\n\n**1.  Urgent \u2013 Ruling out Serious Neurological & Vascular Issues (even with normal MRI):**\n\n* **Repeat Neurological Evaluation:** A *fourth* neurologist opinion, preferably one specializing in neurovascular conditions or autonomic dysfunction, is warranted.  Don't be afraid to travel to a center of excellence if needed. Specifically ask for:\n    * **Detailed Autonomic Testing:** This is *critical*.  Includes Tilt Table Test, Sweat Testing, and Heart Rate Variability testing to assess the function of the autonomic nervous system (which controls blood pressure, heart rate, etc.). This will help determine if orthostatic intolerance is due to POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) or another autonomic issue.\n    * **Cerebral Blood Flow Study:**  A SPECT scan or other cerebral blood flow study.  A standard MRI might not show subtle issues with blood flow.\n    * **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):**  *Despite* the neurologists\u2019 initial assessment against meningitis, the persistence of severe headache + nausea/vomiting + neurological symptoms, along with the positional component, makes a repeat consideration necessary.  Sometimes early or atypical presentations of infection/inflammation can be missed.  It is crucial to rule out subtle infectious or autoimmune causes.\n* **Emergency Room Consideration:** Don't hesitate to go to the ER if symptoms *suddenly worsen* or new symptoms develop (e.g., fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness on one side of the body).  While you've been cautious about meningitis, escalating symptoms demand acute evaluation.\n\n**2.  High Priority \u2013 Investigating Potential Underlying Conditions:**\n\n* **Wilson\u2019s Disease & Porphyria:**  Get these tests done ASAP. Prioritize getting to the lab, even if uncomfortable.\n* **Complete Liver Evaluation:**  The MRCP is a good step.  However, it might need to be followed up with:\n    * **Liver Biopsy:** This is the gold standard for diagnosing many liver conditions, even if previous imaging is relatively normal.\n    * **Further Investigation into Bile Duct Narrowing:**  The cause needs to be identified.\n* **Adrenal Insufficiency:** This can present with fatigue, nausea, weakness, and orthostatic hypotension.  A morning cortisol level and an ACTH stimulation test are needed.\n* **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):** While less likely, MCAS can cause a wide range of symptoms, including neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular issues, often triggered by position changes. Hematologic testing can look for mast cell mediators.\n\n**3. Important Considerations - Related to Medication & Supportive Care:**\n\n* **Nitroglycerin Patch \u2013 Immediate Discussion with Prescribing Physician:**  This is *paramount*.  The patch needs to be reassessed in light of the positional intolerance.  Is it truly necessary?  Can the dosage be lowered? Can it be discontinued *under medical supervision*?\n* **Hydration & Electrolytes:**  Ensure adequate fluid and electrolyte intake (sodium, potassium, magnesium). Dehydration can worsen orthostatic intolerance.\n* **Diet:**  A bland, easily digestible diet can help manage nausea/vomiting.\n* **Symptom Diary:**  Keep a detailed log of symptoms, their severity, and any potential triggers (e.g., time of day, food, position changes).\n\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Doctors:**\n\n* \"What is the most likely diagnosis, given the constellation of symptoms?\" (Even if they say \"unknown,\" push for their *best guess* and rationale.)\n* \"What tests are still needed to rule out serious conditions?\"\n* \"Is there a specialist you recommend who might have more experience with cases like this?\"\n* \"What are the potential risks and benefits of continuing the nitroglycerin patch in light of his symptoms?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I 18M have frontal lobe epilepsy and started smoking weed before I was diagnosed but now it's getting a bit boring and im often offered molly and coke and was wondering if it was safe for me to take since I'm fine with weed and booze",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* important question, and I'm glad you're asking it.  It's great that you're thinking about the potential risks before experimenting with new substances.  Here's a breakdown of why this is a concern, why your current experience with weed and alcohol doesn't necessarily mean anything, and what you should absolutely do. **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response as well.**\n\n**Why This Is A Serious Concern: Frontal Lobe Epilepsy and Recreational Drugs**\n\nFrontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) is a complex condition. The frontal lobe controls a lot of things \u2013 personality, decision-making, impulse control, and importantly, *seizure control*.  Combining FLE with recreational drugs like MDMA (Molly) and cocaine is significantly riskier than for someone without epilepsy. Here's why:\n\n*   **Lowered Seizure Threshold:**  Many recreational drugs, including MDMA and cocaine, can *lower your seizure threshold*. This means it takes less stimulation for a seizure to start. Because you *already* have epilepsy, you're starting from a more vulnerable point. Even if your seizures are well-controlled, these drugs can increase the frequency or severity of seizures.\n*   **Drug Interactions with Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):** You're likely on medication to manage your epilepsy. MDMA and cocaine can *interact* with these medications, either making them less effective or increasing their side effects. This is incredibly dangerous as it can lead to breakthrough seizures.  The interactions can be unpredictable and vary depends on what medications you're on.\n*   **Cardiovascular Effects:** Cocaine, in particular, is a stimulant that significantly increases heart rate and blood pressure.  This can be dangerous for anyone, but especially concerning for people with underlying neurological conditions, and can even *trigger* seizures. MDMA also puts strain on the cardiovascular system, though through different mechanisms.\n*   **Neurotoxicity:**  Both MDMA and cocaine can be neurotoxic, meaning they can damage brain cells.  While the long-term effects are still being researched, this is an additional risk for someone who already has a neurological condition.\n* **Impact on Frontal Lobe Function:** Because you have *frontal* lobe epilepsy, drugs that affect cognitive function, impulsivity, and judgment (like these) could exacerbate your epilepsy or make seizures more likely or unusual.\n\n**Why Your Experience with Weed and Alcohol Doesn't Guarantee Safety**\n\nYou mention you're \"fine\" with weed and booze. This is *not* a reliable indicator that other drugs will be safe. Here's why:\n\n*   **Different Mechanisms of Action:** Weed and alcohol affect the brain differently than MDMA and cocaine.  They interact with different neurotransmitter systems and have different effects on brain activity.\n*   **Individual Variability:** Everyone's brain chemistry is different.  You might be relatively tolerant to the effects of alcohol or cannabis, but that doesn't mean you'll be tolerant to the effects of stimulants like cocaine or MDMA.\n* **Dosage & Purity:** The amount of weed you use, and the alcohol you drink, relative to the levels of molly and coke proposed are entirely different. Furthermore, the purity of illegal drugs is *never* guaranteed. You don\u2019t know what else is in them and that can heavily influence the effect.\n\n\n\n**What You *Absolutely* Should Do**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Neurologist IMMEDIATELY:** This is the most important step.  You *must* discuss your concerns and the fact that you're being offered these drugs with the doctor who treats your epilepsy. They can:\n    *   Assess your specific seizure type and control.\n    *   Explain how these drugs might interact with your AEDs.\n    *   Give you personalized advice based on your medical history.\n2.  **Be Honest:** Don't downplay or hide anything from your doctor. Be honest about your past drug use (including cannabis) and the current offers you're receiving.\n3.  **Say NO:**  Given your epilepsy, it is safest to avoid MDMA and cocaine *completely*.  The risks far outweigh any potential \"fun.\"  It's okay to say no to peer pressure. Your health is more important.\n4. **Consider the Source:**  You mentioned being *offered* these drugs.  Think carefully about the people offering them to you. Do they have your best interests at heart?  Are they aware of your medical condition?\n5. **Mental Health Support:** If you're feeling pressured to use drugs or struggling with why you're considering them, talking to a therapist or counselor can be really helpful.\n\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) - Offers information about epilepsy and medications.\n*   **National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA):** [https://www.drugabuse.gov/](https://www.drugabuse.gov/) - Provides information about the risks of drug use.\n*   **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357) - A confidential, free, 24/7 information service, in English and Spanish, for individuals and families facing mental health or substance use disorders.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  I am not a substitute for the advice of a medical professional.  Taking illicit drugs can have serious health consequences, and doing so with epilepsy introduces significantly elevated risks.\n\n\n\n**In summary:  Given your frontal lobe epilepsy, using MDMA or cocaine is a very risky proposition.  Please talk to your neurologist before even considering it. Your health and safety are paramount.**"

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a truly terrifying situation, and I'm so incredibly sorry you're going through this. You've provided a *huge* amount of detail, which is helpful, and it's clear you're doing everything you can to understand what's happening.  It's completely understandable you're losing hope, but it's also crucial to keep searching for possibilities and advocating for your fiancee.  I will try to address your questions and offer information, but please remember *I am not a medical professional* and this is not medical advice. This is information gathering and brainstorming, and you must continue to rely on her medical team.\n\n**First, let's break down what's happening and address your specific questions.**\n\n**Understanding SRSE and the Challenges**\n\n* **Status Epilepticus (SE) & Super-Refractory Status Epilepticus (SRSE):** SE is a single seizure lasting >5 minutes or multiple seizures without full recovery between them. SRSE is defined as SE that continues for >24 hours despite treatment with at least two first-line and one second-line AEDs (antiepileptic drugs). She\u2019s well into SRSE territory, and it's incredibly difficult to treat.\n* **The Frustration of Treatment Failure:**  You\u2019ve outlined a comprehensive list of medications tried. The fact that they\u2019ve had transient effects (12 hours, a few hours) is sadly common in SRSE. This suggests the underlying cause is powerfully overriding the medication effects.\n* **The Unknown Etiology is Key:** The biggest challenge is the lack of a clear cause.  Meningitis/Encephalitis ruled out common infectious agents is good, but doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t an underlying inflammatory or autoimmune process.\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Questions & Concerns**\n\n1.  **Babinski Reflex:** You're right to be concerned about the asymptomatic Babinski. It's not a normal finding. Your professor was astute. It *could* point to underlying cortical dysfunction, even without other obvious neurological signs initially.  It\u2019s good the neurologists are aware of this historical detail.\n\n2.  **Possible Causes (Beyond What\u2019s Been Investigated):**  You're doing the right thing by pushing for an exhaustive search.  Here\u2019s a more detailed breakdown, branching from what\u2019s been explored:\n    *   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** This is *crucially* important. The labs are right to be looking at this. There are numerous autoimmune antibodies that can cause SRSE, and they can be difficult to detect. *Don't stop pushing for a comprehensive autoimmune encephalitis panel.*  This includes antibodies against neuronal surface antigens (e.g., NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor) and intracellular antigens. Sometimes repeat testing is needed as antibody levels can fluctuate.\n    *   **Infectious Triggers (Subtle/Atypical):**  Even with negative initial tests, a viral or bacterial infection can sometimes trigger SRSE through immune mechanisms. Consider:\n        *   **Tick-borne Illnesses:** Given the camping trip and insect bites, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and other less common tick-borne pathogens should be considered, even if initial testing was negative.  Testing can be unreliable, and sometimes requires specialized labs.  *Specifically ask if they\u2019ve considered these, given the history.*\n        *   **Viral Encephalitis \u2013 Difficult to Detect:** Some viral encephalitides don\u2019t have a strong presence in CSF but can still cause inflammation.\n        *   **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) PCR:** Ensure a HSV PCR was performed on the CSF.\n    *   **Metabolic Disorders:**  Rare genetic metabolic disorders can present with SRSE. These are less likely given her age and previous health, but should be in the differential.\n    *   **Genetic Epilepsy Syndromes:** Some rare genetic epilepsy syndromes can present with SRSE.\n    *   **Drug-Induced:**  While drug screens were negative, consider potential interactions with Prozac and Busiprone (though a switch shouldn\u2019t usually cause this).  Also, the potential for unusual effects from marijuana use.\n    *   **Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE):** While she's having visible seizures, ruling out *coexisting* NCSE is important. It's possible there's ongoing electrical storm activity *between* the obvious seizures that\u2019s contributing to the overall problem. Continuous EEG monitoring is crucial for this.\n3.  **Allopregnanolone:** You're smart to have found that study. It's a very promising area of research. Allopregnanolone is a neurosteroid that can be depleted in epilepsy and may have neuroprotective effects.  *Absolutely discuss this with her neurologist.*  It's not widely available, but some research centers are using it for SRSE.  The study you cited is encouraging.\n4.  **Pentobarbital Coma (Barbiturate-Induced Coma):** This is a very serious intervention, and the neurologist's hesitation is reasonable. It carries significant risks (cardiovascular depression, pneumonia, prolonged withdrawal). However, it can sometimes break the cycle of SRSE when all else fails.  It's a difficult decision that needs to be weighed carefully.  If they proceed, meticulous monitoring is essential.\n5.  **Long-Term Outcomes & Mental Function:** This is the most terrifying question.  The longer SRSE continues, the higher the risk of long-term neurological deficits. However, *it\u2019s not a certainty*.  Several factors influence the outcome:\n    *   **Etiology:** If the underlying cause is found and treated, the chances of recovery are much higher.\n    *   **Duration of SE:**  The longer the seizures persist, the greater the risk of neuronal damage.\n    *   **Age:** Younger patients generally have better outcomes.\n    *   **Severity of Brain Injury:** This is hard to assess without an MRI, but the clinical picture and EEG findings can provide clues.\n    *   **Response to Treatment:**  Even if she doesn\u2019t respond fully to initial treatments, a response (even temporary) can be a good sign.\n\n    It's impossible to predict her mental functioning if she wakes up. It could range from full recovery to significant cognitive impairment.  Early and aggressive rehabilitation is crucial if she survives.\n\n\n\n**Things You Can Do Now (Advocacy & Support)**\n\n*   **Be the Advocate:** You are her voice.  Document everything. Ask questions.  Don't be afraid to challenge the medical team (respectfully) if you feel something is being overlooked.\n*   **Second Opinion:** Is it possible to get a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and SRSE, *especially* one at a major epilepsy center?  A fresh set of eyes can be invaluable.\n*   **Epilepsy Center:** If you\u2019re not already at an epilepsy center (a hospital with a dedicated epilepsy program), transfer her if possible.  They have more expertise and resources.\n*   **Keep a Detailed Log:**  Record the time, duration, and characteristics of every seizure (even the subtle ones).  Note any triggers or patterns you observe.\n*   **Support Groups:**  Connect with support groups for families of people with epilepsy or SRSE.  Sharing experiences and getting emotional support can be incredibly helpful.  (See resources below).\n*    **Discuss Palliative Care Consultation:** This is a really difficult, but important, conversation.  A palliative care team can help you navigate difficult decisions and provide support for both your fiancee and your family, regardless of the outcome.\n\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n*   **American Epilepsy Society:** [https://www.aesnet.org/](https://www.aesnet.org/)\n*   **SRSE/Refractory Epilepsy Resources:**  Search online for \"super-refractory status epilepticus support groups\"  - there are some online communities you can find.\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nYou are facing an incredibly challenging situation.  It's okay to feel overwhelmed, scared, and hopeless at times.  Your fiancee is lucky to have you advocating for her.  Keep pushing for answers, keep exploring options, and remember that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of hope.  \n\n\n\nPlease, keep me updated if you feel comfortable doing so. I will do my best to offer support and resources.  I truly hope for a positive outcome for you and your fiancee.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that's a lot of information, and it's understandable you're seeking more clarity, especially with your seizure control becoming more challenging. You're right to ask for explanations; the terminology can be incredibly dense. Let's break down each of your questions.  I will preface this by saying I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should be discussed with your neurologist.\n\n**First, let's recap your core findings:**\n\n*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:**  Seizures originate in the temporal lobe (involved in memory, emotion, sensory processing)\n*   **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures:** You're having seizures where awareness is altered, but you don't necessarily fall down/lose full consciousness (though sometimes they progress to tonic-clonic).\n*   **Right Hippocampus Issues:** This is the key focus.  The hippocampus is crucial for memory formation.  The abnormalities here are likely driving the seizures.\n*   **Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS):**  Scarring within the hippocampus. It's a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy.\n*   **Right Dorsal Thalamus Atrophy:** The thalamus is a relay station for sensory and motor signals. Atrophy means shrinking/loss of tissue.\n*   **White Matter Changes (Right Parietal Lobe):**  These are less clear in cause but are identified on the MRI.\n\nNow, let's address your specific questions:\n\n**1. Ex-vacuo Dilatation of the Ventricular Trigone:**\n\n*   **Ventricular Trigone:**  Part of the ventricular system in the brain which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  Think of them as fluid-filled spaces within the brain.\n*   **Ex-vacuo:** Latin for \"from emptiness.\" \n*   **Dilatation:** Enlargement.\n\nSo, \"ex-vacuo dilatation\" means the ventricular trigone is enlarged *because surrounding brain tissue has shrunk*. This shrinkage creates more space for the CSF, causing the ventricle to expand. In your case, it's likely related to the atrophy (shrinking) of the hippocampus and thalamus on the right side.  It's a *secondary* finding, a consequence of the primary damage.\n\n**2. T-weighted High-Signal Gliosis:**\n\n*   **T-weighted Imaging (MRI):**  A type of MRI sequence that highlights different types of tissue.\n*   **Gliosis:**  An increase in glial cells (support cells in the brain). This happens in response to injury or damage.  Think of it like scar tissue *at a cellular level*.  The brain is trying to repair itself.  It's not necessarily a \"good\" thing, but it's the brain's response to something wrong.\n*   **High Signal:** On a T-weighted MRI, certain tissues appear bright (high signal). Gliosis often shows up as a high signal.\n\nPutting it together:  \u201cT-weighted high-signal gliosis\u201d indicates areas of scarring/glial cell proliferation, seen on the MRI, in the right parietal lobe. The cause is described as possibly seizure-related or from a previous injury (ischemic \u2013 lack of blood flow, or inflammatory). \n\n**3. Abnormalities (in relation to the right hippocampus):**\n\nThis is a broad term, but in the context of your case, it refers to the structural changes visible on the MRI within the right hippocampus that are *not* normal. Specifically:\n\n*   **Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS):** The primary abnormality. The internal structure of the hippocampus is scarred and disorganized.\n*   **Shape/Size:**  The hippocampus itself may be smaller than it should be due to the MTS.\n* **Signal intensity:** abnormalities in the way the hippocampus appears on the MRI (like the T-weighted high signal gliosis)  which suggests cellular changes.\n\nThese abnormalities disrupt the normal electrical activity of the hippocampus, leading to the focal impaired awareness seizures.\n\n**4. Associated Regional Atrophy:**\n\n*   **Atrophy:**  Loss of tissue volume.  Shrinkage.\n*   **Regional:**  Affecting a specific area.\n*   **Associated:** Linked to the primary problem (MTS in this case).\n\nThe atrophy means the right hippocampus and parts of the thalamus are smaller than expected. This atrophy is *likely* a consequence of the chronic seizure activity and/or the underlying cause of the MTS.  The thalamic atrophy is somewhat more distant, suggesting potentially wider effects of the long-term epilepsy.\n\n**5. Periventricular White Matter:**\n\n*   **White Matter:**  The tissue in the brain that contains nerve fibers (axons) that connect different areas. It's \"white\" because of the myelin sheath that insulates these fibers.\n*   **Periventricular:**  Surrounding the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces).\n\nThe periventricular white matter is a region of the brain that is especially vulnerable to injury due to its location and blood supply.  In your case, the \"T-weighted high-signal gliosis\" within this area suggests damage or inflammation.  \n\n**Is it part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general?** This is a key question.  It's *likely* the white matter changes are related to the underlying problem, whether that's the seizures themselves, the MTS (perhaps affecting connections reaching from the hippocampus), or a previous injury. However, some degree of white matter changes can also occur with age, so it's not always directly linked to the epilepsy. The fact that it's *high signal on T-weighted imaging* suggests more than just normal age-related change.\n\n\n\n**Important Next Steps & Things to Discuss with Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   **Why is seizure control changing?**  Is it progression of the MTS?  Are medications less effective?  Are there other factors?\n*   **Further Investigation:** Could any tests (like extended EEG monitoring, neuropsychological testing) help pinpoint the exact seizure focus or assess cognitive function?\n* **Treatment options** Discuss epilepsy medications, and surgical option and if therapy could work in your case \n\n\n\n\n**To summarize:** Your MRI findings paint a picture of a long-standing problem in the right temporal lobe, centered around the hippocampus. The MTS is a significant finding, and the associated atrophy and white matter changes likely reflect the consequences of chronic seizure activity and/or a prior insult.  \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "A few weeks ago I woke up with a lazy eye. On Sunday only I could notice it, and by Tuesday it was severely deviated. I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* complex presentation and you are right to be concerned and to seek further investigation. It sounds incredibly distressing, and the dismissal from your neurologist is concerning given the *new* and rapidly progressing symptoms. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, potential considerations, and what you should do, broken down into sections.  I'm going to be thorough. **Please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**I. Summary of Your Symptoms - A Concerning Pattern**\n\nLet's summarize because the sheer number of symptoms is significant. You're experiencing:\n\n* **Ocular Issues:** New-onset diplopia (double vision, lazy eye) rapidly progressing, corrected by glasses, fluctuating eye dominance, episodes of eye muscle weakness/paralysis (\"looking stoned\").  Now also potentially oscillopsia (perception of oscillating/bouncing vision).\n* **Neurological Symptoms:** Seizures, tremor (hands and body), vertigo with severe vomiting (leading to incontinence), nystagmus, complex migraines, and muscle weakness.\n* **Autonomic Dysfunction:**  Palmar erythema (red palms) with body flushing, changes in skin color (grayish-purple foot), shallow breathing.\n* **Existing Conditions:**  Epilepsy, Hashimoto's/Hypothyroidism.\n* **Recent History:** Pfizer COVID vaccination.\n* **Medications:** A complex regimen (see below).\n\n\n\n**II. Why the Initial Myasthenia Gravis Consideration (and why it's potentially insufficient)**\n\nYour optometrist correctly identified Myasthenia Gravis as a possibility given the sudden onset of double vision.  MG *can* present with fluctuating weakness, often improving with rest, and sometimes responding to glasses (because the symptoms may fluctuate over minutes or hours).   However, *negative* MG antibody tests don't completely rule it out. *Seronegative MG* exists \u2013 meaning some people have MG without the typical antibodies.  However, given the *breadth* of your symptoms, relying solely on that result seems inadequate.\n\n**III.  Potential Differential Diagnoses (What else could it be?)**\n\nGiven the entire constellation of symptoms, several possibilities need to be considered, some more likely than others.  This is why a neuro-ophthalmologist is absolutely critical.\n\n* **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):** A rare autoimmune disorder affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord.  It can cause optic neuritis (vision problems), transverse myelitis (weakness, sensory changes), and brainstem symptoms like vertigo and nystagmus. Crucially, NMOSD often has *negative* MG antibodies, but has a specific antibody (AQP4).\n* **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Can present with a wide array of neurological symptoms, including vision problems (optic neuritis, diplopia), vertigo, tremor, and even autonomic dysfunction.  While the MRI of your vestibular system was normal, MS can affect the brain and spinal cord in areas *not* seen on that scan.\n* **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**  A group of conditions where the immune system attacks the brain.  Symptoms are diverse and can include seizures, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive changes, movement disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and vision problems.  Antibody testing is crucial for many types, but often very specific panels need to be ordered.\n* **Vascular Issues:** While less likely given the rapid onset, vascular problems affecting the brainstem or cerebellum *could* cause some of these symptoms.\n* **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:**  Rarely, symptoms like these can be caused by the immune system reacting to a hidden cancer.\n* **Drug-Induced:** Given your medication list, while you say there have been no recent changes, the *interaction* of these medications or cumulative effects should be carefully reviewed. (See Section V).\n* **Post-Viral Syndrome/Dysautonomia:** Sometimes COVID-19 vaccination or infection can trigger autoimmune-like responses or dysautonomia (dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system). This is less likely to explain the seizures and dramatic eye findings, but could contribute to the flushing, breathing issues, and perhaps some of the vertigo.\n\n\n\n**IV.  Why the Neuro-Ophthalmologist is Essential**\n\nA neuro-ophthalmologist specializes in the connection between neurological and visual systems. They will:\n\n* **Detailed Neuro-Ophthalmic Exam:** They\u2019ll do a much more thorough exam of your eye movements, visual fields, pupillary responses, and assess for subtle signs of neurological disease.\n* **Order Specific Tests:**  They'll likely order more detailed testing, including:\n    * **Repeat MG Antibody Testing:** Including looking for MuSK antibodies, which are present in some MG patients.\n    * **NMOSD Antibody (AQP4) Testing:** Absolutely essential.\n    * **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** To analyze cerebrospinal fluid for antibodies, inflammation, and other markers.\n    * **Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP):**  To assess the function of the optic nerve.\n    *Additional imaging if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n**V. Medications \u2013 A Critical Review**\n\nYour medication list is complex. While you say there are no recent changes, let's consider potential contributions:\n\n* **Trileptal & Lamictal:**  Antiepileptic drugs. Side effects can include dizziness, ataxia (lack of coordination), blurred vision, and skin rashes.\n* **Abilify & Seroquel:** Antipsychotics. Can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (tremor, muscle rigidity), sedation, and orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing).\n* **Oxybutinin:**  For overactive bladder. Can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and cognitive effects.\n* **Protonix:** PPI. Usually well-tolerated.\n* **Synthroid:** Hypothyroidism treatment.  Important to maintain proper dosage.\n* **Interactions:** The combination of these medications increases the risk of adverse effects.  A pharmacist or neurologist should review for potential drug interactions.\n\n**VI. What You Need To Do *Now***\n\n1. **Keep Your Neuro-Ophthalmology Appointment:**  Do not delay. Be prepared to provide a detailed history.\n2. **Detailed Symptom Journal:**  Keep a very detailed log of your symptoms:\n    * **Time of day**\n    * **Specific symptoms** (e.g., \"Left eye won't open for 5 minutes,\" \"Severe vertigo with nausea and vomiting,\" \"Bright red palms, then full body flush\")\n    * **Severity (scale of 1-10)**\n    * **Triggers** (if any) - stress, specific movements, food, etc.\n    * **Relieving factors** (e.g., glasses help double vision).\n3. **Request Records:** Obtain copies of *all* your medical records \u2013 including the MRI report, bloodwork results, neurology notes, and optometry report.\n4. **Seek a Second Neurology Opinion:**  You deserve a thorough evaluation. Don't hesitate to find another neurologist, preferably one specializing in neuroimmunology or complex neurological disorders.  Explain your concerns about the rapid progression of your symptoms and the lack of further investigation.\n5. **Advocate for Yourself:**  You know your body best.  If you feel something is wrong, keep pushing for answers.  Bring a friend or family member to appointments to help you advocate.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical care. The differential diagnoses listed are possibilities and do not represent a diagnosis. You *must* consult with qualified healthcare professionals for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.  The fact that I list several possibilities is *because* your case is complex and requires thorough investigation. Your neurologist's dismissal of your symptoms is not typical and warrants further exploration.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful.  You are experiencing a lot, and getting a diagnosis (even if it takes time) is crucial to starting the right treatment and improving your quality of life.  Good luck!"

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* complex situation, and you're right to be confused. You've been through a lot, and it's understandable it's hard to make sense of this. Your instincts about the interplay between PNES and potential underlying epilepsy are *very* astute. Let's break things down and address your questions.\n\n**Does your theory make sense? Is it likely?**\n\n**Yes, your theory absolutely makes sense, and it's surprisingly likely.** You're hitting on a crucial point often overlooked. PNES and epilepsy frequently co-occur. Estimates vary, but 20-30% is a common range \u2013 and some studies suggest it could be even higher.  Here's why your idea is plausible:\n\n* **Keppra as Masking:** Keppra *could* have been suppressing underlying epileptic activity, which was the root cause of the hallucinations. By quieting the epilepsy, it unmasked the PNES symptoms that were always present but overshadowed. A good analogy would be turning down the volume on a radio \u2013 you might then hear a quieter, underlying static that was previously drowned out.\n* **PNES as a Response:** PNES are often seen as a way the brain responds to underlying distress \u2013 trauma, anxiety, depression, etc.  When the epilepsy was \u201ccontrolled\u201d, the brain may have started expressing that distress in the form of PNES more prominently.\n* **Complex Interaction:** The relationship between epilepsy, PNES, and psychiatric conditions can be incredibly intertwined.  It's not always a clear \"either/or\" situation.  There can be a cascade of effects, with one condition influencing the others.\n\n**No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?**\n\nThis is the most important question, and the answer is likely related to your theory.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Re-emergence of Underlying Epilepsy:** If the Keppra *was* controlling some underlying seizure activity, coming off it would allow that activity to return, and with it, the hallucinations. The hallucinations might not be identical to the original ones, but they\u2019re a familiar symptom returning.\n2. **Increased PNES Expression:**  Even if the Keppra wasn\u2019t fully suppressing epilepsy, the reduction in neurological \u201cnoise\u201d from less medication might have allowed the *expression* of PNES to become more prominent. The brain is still trying to find ways to cope with stress, and the PNES symptoms, including hallucinations, are resurfacing.\n3. **Psychological Impact of Weaning:**  Weaning off medication can be emotionally destabilizing, even if it's the right thing to do.  The uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the change could trigger or exacerbate both PNES and underlying psychiatric vulnerabilities.\n4. **The 'Kindling' Effect (less likely, but possible):** In some instances, repeated PNES events can, over time, lower the threshold for actual epileptic seizures to occur, which could now be manifesting.\n\n**What can you do now? (While waiting for appointments)**\n\n* **Document, Document, Document:**  Keep a very detailed log of *everything*. This is critical. Include:\n    * **Date and Time:** Of each event, whether a hallucination, PNES event, or change in mental state.\n    * **Specific Symptoms:**  Be precise.  What kind of hallucination (visual, auditory, tactile), what did she see/hear/feel?  Describe the PNES event in detail. How long does it last? What happens before, during, and after?\n    * **Potential Triggers:**  What was happening immediately before the event? Stressful situations, changes in routine, specific emotions (anxiety, sadness, anger), sleep deprivation.\n    * **Medication Log:** Confirm the exact dates of Keppra tapering and when she was completely off it.\n    * **Impact on Functioning:** How do these events affect her ability to perform daily tasks?\n* **Emergency Plan:**  Since self-harm was a concern previously, revisit and reinforce your safety plan.  Ensure you know how to access immediate help if needed (crisis hotline, emergency services).\n* **Focus on Stress Reduction (Hard, but Important):** I know this is incredibly difficult, but minimizing stressors in her life as much as possible is crucial. Explore relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation) with her \u2013 even if she's reluctant.\n* **Communicate Clearly with Providers:** When you *do* get appointments, bring this detailed log with you.  Clearly articulate your theory about the Keppra masking underlying epilepsy.  Don\u2019t downplay your observations.\n* **Consider a Second Opinion (Neurology):**  If you're feeling unsure about the current neurological assessment, seeking a second opinion from another neurologist specializing in epilepsy and PNES could be beneficial.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Neuropsychological Evaluation:** The neuropsychologist referral is excellent. Neuropsych testing can help identify cognitive strengths and weaknesses that might be affected by both epilepsy and PNES, and help tailor a treatment plan.\n* **Psychotherapy:**  Therapy, specifically approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Trauma-Focused CBT, is crucial for managing PNES.  It helps her learn coping mechanisms to deal with the underlying stress and emotions contributing to the events.\n* **Don't Blame Yourself:** You're doing everything you can to advocate for your wife. This is a frustrating and challenging process, and it's not your fault that it's taking time to get to the bottom of things.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re doing a great job of being a supportive and observant partner. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Keep advocating for your wife, and don't hesitate to seek support for yourself as well.  Being a caregiver is incredibly demanding, and you deserve to have your own well-being prioritized."

        "question": " Hi, I bit of back story here I've been diagnostic with NF1 when I was 5 ever since I had to do 2 MRI every year. every time they put a needle in my arm I would faint.So today I just got my blood draw for a schedule MRI in 3 weeks. And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds really scary and it's good you were being monitored during the blood draw, and that the needle was removed quickly.  Having a history of fainting (vasovagal syncope) with needles is common, but the *addition* of uncontrolled movements definitely warrants a thorough look.  Here's a breakdown of what *could* be going on, potential names for what you experienced, and what you need to communicate to your doctors.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end of this response - this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Components**\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope (Fainting):** This is the most likely explanation for the fainting itself. It's a common reaction to stress (like needles) that causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly, limiting blood flow to the brain.  It's often triggered by the vagus nerve being overstimulated.  You already know you're prone to this, which is important.  Symptoms can include feeling warm, sweaty, nauseous, lightheaded, vision changes, and then loss of consciousness.\n* **Involuntary Movements (The New Piece):** *This* is the concerning part, and why it's so important to get it checked out.  The fact these happened *during* the fainting adds complexity.  There are several possibilities here, and it needs medical evaluation to determine the cause.  The description of \u201cuncontrollable movements\u201d is broad, and the specific *type* of movement is crucial information for a doctor.\n\n\n\n**Possible Explanations & Potential Names (What your doctors might consider/investigate)**\n\nHere's a breakdown, ranging from more likely to less likely, but *all* require assessment.  I'm including potential medical terms to help you talk to your doctor.  I\u2019m also considering your NF1 diagnosis, as it can influence potential causes.\n\n1. **Vasovagal Syncope with Associated Neurological Symptoms/Convulsive Syncope:** Some people experience brief, brief, brief muscle jerks or twitching *during* a vasovagal syncope event.  This is sometimes called \u201cconvulsive syncope\u201d even though it\u2019s not true epilepsy. It\u2019s thought to be related to brief disruptions in brain activity during the blood pressure drop.  This is more common than some of the other possibilities, *especially* given your known history of fainting with needles.  However,  because you described it as \u201cuncontrollable movements,\u201d its important to rule out other possibilities.\n2. **Seizure Activity (Generalized Tonic-Clonic seizure, or Absence Seizure could be possibilities):**  While often associated with a more prolonged event, *brief* seizure activity can sometimes manifest with jerking or uncontrolled movements.  This is particularly important to consider because of your NF1.  **NF1 has a slightly increased risk of developing certain types of seizures**, although it's not super common.  It's ESSENTIAL to rule this out. The movements may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness (though yours *was* concurrent with fainting).\n3.  **Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Related Neurological Manifestations:** NF1 can have a wide range of neurological effects, beyond the typical tumors that are monitored with MRIs.  These can sometimes include subtle seizure tendencies or other movement disorders.  While less likely to present *just* during a blood draw, it\u2019s a factor your doctors need to keep in mind given your existing diagnosis.\n4. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These are involuntary movements and behaviors that *look* like seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  They are a manifestation of psychological distress.  These are a diagnosis of *exclusion* \u2013 meaning other causes must be ruled out first. They're often triggered by stress or trauma (and needles certainly count as stressful!). This is less likely to be the FIRST thing a doctor explores, but it's on the differential list.\n5. **Less Likely, but Important to Consider:**  Rarely, other underlying neurological conditions could be revealed under the stress of a medical procedure.\n\n\n**What You *MUST* Tell Your Doctor**\n\nThis is really important.  Don't minimize anything. Be specific.\n\n* **Detailed Description of the Movements:**  This is the most important thing.\n    * Were they jerking? Twitching?  Rigid?\n    * Which limbs were affected? (arms, legs, face?)\n    * Were the movements symmetrical (both sides of the body) or asymmetrical (one side)?\n    * How long did they last?\n    * Did you have any awareness during the movements? (Could you feel what was happening, but couldn't stop it?)\n* **Timing in Relation to the Fainting:**  Did the movements start *before*, *during*, or *after* you lost consciousness?\n* **Your History of Fainting:**  Emphasize your long history of vasovagal syncope with needles.\n* **Your NF1 Diagnosis:** Make sure all your doctors are aware of your NF1.\n* **Any Other Symptoms:**  Have you experienced any other unusual symptoms lately? (headaches, vision changes, weakness, changes in coordination, mood changes, etc.).\n* **Family History:**  Is there any family history of seizures or neurological disorders?\n\n\n\n\n**What Your Doctor Will Likely Do**\n\n* **Detailed Neurological Exam:** They'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, and sensory function.\n* **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):**  To look for any underlying heart rhythm problems that might contribute to fainting.\n* **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** *This is very likely*.  An EEG records the electrical activity in your brain and is the primary test to diagnose or rule out seizure activity.\n* **Blood Tests:**  To rule out other medical conditions.\n* **MRI (Possibly):**  Since you are already scheduled for an MRI, they may consider focusing the MRI protocol on looking for neurological changes if the EEG is inconclusive.\n* **Referral to a Neurologist:**  Given the new symptom (the movements), a neurologist is the appropriate specialist to evaluate this.  \n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous. Your situation is complex, with a history of vasovagal syncope *and* new neurological symptoms; a proper diagnosis from a doctor is crucial.  Do not delay seeking medical attention.\n\n\n\nI really hope you get answers soon and that everything turns out to be okay.  It's good you're proactive about getting this checked out. Let me know if you have clarification questions about anything I've said, but please remember to always defer to the advice of your medical team."

        "question": "49YO female with IBS like symptoms due to adhesions choking intestines, non-epileptic seizures due to migraines, deaf, in TCHP chemo for breast cancer, BMX August 1, 2018, no node involvement. 5'6, 220lbs. Effexor for seizure prevention. Bupropion for situational depression related to health challenges. I lost my hair to chemo, so for the first time I noticed I have ridges in my scalp. Googling that, only one thing comes up: Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG). My ridges, however, are very mild compared to most images. I can see them in the mirror, but can't find a way to accurately photograph them. They are very much like this in location and \"layout\", but not quite as deep. This is listed as something different though, related to mental retardation (article's words) from birth. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00105-007-1302-4 I do have a couple of the secondary issues listed, namely non-epileptic seizures and deafness. The former is blamed on migraines that left lesions on the brain and the latter is blamed on the seizures. Should I see an endocrinologist, or is this something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex medical picture and you're right to be thoughtful and investigate. Let's break down the situation and address your concerns.  You've done good work in researching and noting the connections, and it's smart to be proactive. Here's a thorough response, divided into sections, and then a strong recommendation:\n\n**1. Understanding Your Concerns & The Cutis Verticis Gyrata (CVG) Question**\n\n* **You're Right to Be Cautious About Self-Diagnosis:** While you're doing great research, CVG is a clinical diagnosis.  Just because you see some resemblance doesn't mean you have it. The association with intellectual disability is a strong one, particularly for *primary* CVG, and your history doesn't suggest that. The article you linked focuses heavily on that form of the condition.\n* **CVG (and its types):** CVG isn't *always* associated with intellectual disability.  It's categorized into:\n    * **Primary (Essential) CVG:**  This is the classic form, often present at birth or early childhood, and is usually associated with neurological abnormalities.  This is the type the linked article discusses.\n    * **Secondary CVG:** This is the more relevant consideration in your case. It can develop later in life and is often linked to underlying medical conditions like:\n        * **Neurological conditions:** Seizures, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases.\n        * **Connective Tissue Disorders:** Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome.\n        * **Inflammatory skin conditions**\n        * **Rarely, it can be associated with malignancy - although this is less common.**\n* **Your Situation is Different:** The fact that you only noticed these ridges *after* chemotherapy and a bilateral mastectomy is significant. This strongly suggests a *secondary* form, if it is indeed CVG at all.  The timing is key.\n* **The Seizures and Deafness Link:** Your explanation of the connection between seizures, migraines, and deafness is reasonable given your medical history. However, it *also* makes considering CVG a little more relevant, as seizures are a potential trigger for secondary CVG.\n\n\n\n**2.  Why These Ridges Might Be Appearing (Beyond CVG)**\n\nGiven your medical history, several other possibilities should be considered before jumping to CVG:\n\n* **Skin Changes from Chemo/TCHP:** Chemotherapy can have a wide range of dermatological side effects. While hair loss is common, skin texture changes are possible.  The scalp skin can become thinner and more sensitive. While not typically ridges, it can alter appearance.\n* **Hormonal Shifts:**  Your bilateral mastectomy and subsequent cancer treatment lead to significant hormonal changes (even with Tamoxifen, if you're on it). These changes *can* affect skin elasticity and texture.\n* **Weight Fluctuations & Skin Elasticity:**  Weight gain and loss can affect skin elasticity.  At 220lbs for a 5'6\" frame, you have a BMI indicating obesity.  Repeated weight changes can contribute to skin changes though they typically manifest as stretch marks rather than ridges.\n* **Dehydration:**  Chemotherapy can sometimes lead to dehydration, which can make skin appear less plump and potentially accentuate underlying skin structures.\n* **Scar Tissue/Adhesions (though unlikely on the scalp):**  While you mentioned adhesions internally, it\u2019s less likely to directly contribute to scalp ridges.\n\n\n\n**3. The Importance of Your Medical History**\n\n* **Breast Cancer Treatment (TCHP & BMX):** This is central. Any new skin findings *after* cancer treatment need careful evaluation.\n* **IBS-like symptoms:** Though seemingly unrelated, chronic inflammation and nutrient absorption issues could *theoretically* play a role in skin health.\n* **Effexor & Bupropion:**  These medications themselves typically do not cause skin changes like ridges, but it's always worth noting all medications to a doctor.\n\n**4. Should You See an Endocrinologist?**\n\nWhile an endocrinologist *could* be part of the evaluation, **I believe your first step should be to see a DERMATOLOGIST.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Dermatologists are the skin experts:** They're best equipped to visually assess the ridges, determine if they are consistent with CVG, or if they're something else. They can perform a skin biopsy (if necessary) to get a definitive diagnosis.\n* **They understand secondary CVG:** A dermatologist will be aware of the potential for secondary CVG due to neurological or systemic conditions.\n* **They can assess for other skin conditions:** There may be another dermatological explanation that's simpler to address.\n* **They'll coordinate with other specialists:** If the dermatologist suspects a connection to your cancer treatment or other medical conditions, they\u2019ll likely coordinate with your oncologist and potentially refer you to an endocrinologist or neurologist if necessary.\n\n\n\n**5. What to Tell Your Doctor (Dermatologist)**\n\n* **Detailed History:**  Provide a complete medical history, as you've done here, including your cancer diagnosis, treatment, surgeries, medications, seizure history, and deafness.\n* **Timing:**  Emphasize that you *first* noticed the ridges after the chemotherapy and mastectomy.\n* **Describe the Ridges:** Be as specific as possible.  How deep are they?  How wide?  What is their length?  Are they localized to a specific area of the scalp? Are they changing?\n* **Photos (if possible):** While you say they're hard to photograph, *try* multiple angles and lighting conditions. Even a blurry photo is better than nothing.  Your dermatologist can also take professional photos if needed.\n* **Your Research:**  It's okay to tell your doctor you've researched CVG but understand it's a possible, not definite, diagnosis.\n\n**In summary**:  You're rightly concerned, and your proactive research is excellent.  However, given your complex medical history, scheduling an appointment with a **Dermatologist** is the most logical first step to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management plan. Don't panic, but don't ignore it either.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a *very* reasonable question and a common concern for parents when starting (and adjusting) anti-epileptic medications. You're right to ask \"why\" and to want to understand the reasoning. It's excellent that you're engaged and advocating for your son. Here's a breakdown of why a neurologist might increase the dose even when things *seem* stable, along with things to consider, and some questions you might want to ask your neurologist.  I will preface this with a *very important disclaimer at the end*.\n\n**Why Increase the Dose, Even with Recent Stability?**\n\n* **Target Dosage & Therapeutic Window:** Keppra (levetiracetam) has a \"therapeutic window.\" This means there\u2019s a range of dosages where it's effective. It's likely the 2ml dosage is *beginning* to control the seizures, but the neurologist believes a higher dose (3ml) will bring him *more definitively* into that therapeutic window.  The goal isn't just \"no seizures *right now*,\" but to achieve the most robust control possible to minimize the risk of breakthrough seizures. Think of it like finding the \"sweet spot.\"\n* **Individual Variability:** Everyone metabolizes medication differently. What works for one person (even with the same diagnosis) might not work the same way for another. Your son's body might require a slightly higher dose to reach optimal control.\n* **\"Subclinical\" Activity:** An EEG can show more than just full-blown seizures. It can detect \"subclinical\" activity \u2013 abnormal brain waves that *aren't* causing obvious symptoms, but indicate ongoing seizure tendencies. A higher dose of Keppra might be aimed at suppressing that subclinical activity, even if your son isn't visibly seizing.  The initial EEG showed slower waves, suggesting a predisposition.\n* **Preventative Approach:** The neurologist isn't just reacting to the seizures he *had* while on vacation. They are proactively trying to *prevent* future seizures. The fact that he had seizures clustered together (1-2/day) suggests a certain level of instability. Increasing the dose aims to solidify that stability.\n* **Long-Term Control:**  The initial improvement could be a \"honeymoon\" period. Sometimes medications are very effective initially, then their effectiveness wanes slightly over time as the body adjusts.  Increasing the dose now can help establish a more durable level of control.\n* **Medication Tolerance:** It\u2019s possible your son is already developing some tolerance to the 2ml, and a slight bump will keep it effective for a little longer.\n\n\n\n**Your Concerns are Valid**\n\nYou're smart to be thinking about side effects. Keppra is generally well-tolerated, but side effects *can* occur, including:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Irritability\n*   Behavioral Changes (rare but important)\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Decreased appetite\n\nIncreasing the dose *could* increase the risk or severity of these side effects.  That's why it\u2019s important to monitor closely.\n\n**What to Ask Your Neurologist**\n\nHere are specific questions that might help you feel more comfortable:\n\n*   **\"Can you explain specifically why you're increasing the dosage at this time, given the fact that he's been seizure-free for a week?\"**  (This is the core question!)\n*   **\"What level of seizure control are we aiming for? Is it just to be completely seizure-free, or are you also trying to address any underlying EEG abnormalities?\"**\n*   **\"What side effects should I be looking out for with the increased dosage?  What should I do if I notice them?\"** (Specifically ask about behavioral changes, even subtle ones - these can be easy to miss but are important to report).\n*   **\"How long should we stay at the 3ml dosage before re-evaluating?\"**\n*   **\u201cAre there any other factors, like his age, weight, or overall health, that are influencing your decision?\u201d**\n*   **\"Is there a plan to eventually try to reduce the dosage again, once we've established good control?\"** (This shows you're thinking about the long term).\n\n\n\n\n**Monitoring and Communication are Key**\n\n*   **Keep a detailed log:** Record the dosage, time of administration, and *any* changes in your son\u2019s behavior, mood, activity level, or appetite. Even seemingly minor changes are important to note.\n*   **Communicate regularly:** Don\u2019t hesitate to call the neurologist\u2019s office if you have concerns or notice any side effects.  They want to know!  Don\u2019t wait for the next appointment.\n* **Follow up appointments:** Be diligent about keeping all scheduled follow-up appointments.\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\n*I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your neurologist is the best source of information about your son's specific case.  They have reviewed his medical history, exam findings, and test results and are tailoring the treatment plan to his individual needs.*\n\n\n\nYou are doing a great job being a proactive and informed parent. Trust your instincts, ask questions, and work closely with your neurologist. It\u2019s a partnership! I truly hope your son continues to do well, and that you find the optimal treatment plan for him."

        "question": "48F, 152cm, 70kgGraves' disease in and out of remission for 10 years (remission last 2 years)Stopped carbimazole two weeks agoVery mild temporal lobe epilepsy for 30 yearsLevetiracetam 500mg dailyTetanus vaccination for deep cat scratch five days agoJust finishing a 5-day course of amoxicillin w/ clavulanic acid for same scratchA few days ago, I noticed some swelling above my left clavicle, and I can feel a pea-to-marble sized lump. Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, deep breaths. It's *very* good that your rational brain kicked in, as it sounds like the most likely explanation here is related to the recent tetanus vaccination and cat scratch. You're right to be proactive about getting it checked, but let's break down why this is likely a reactive lymph node and less alarming than your initial fear.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why a reactive lymph node from the tetanus shot is the most probable cause, given your history:**\n\n* **Location:** Swelling *above* the clavicle on the *same side* as the tetanus shot is a classic presentation of a reactive lymph node (lymphadenopathy) due to immunization. The lymph nodes in this area (supraclavicular nodes) drain lymph from the arm and shoulder.\n* **Timing:**  Five days after a vaccination is well within the timeframe for a reactive lymph node to appear and be noticeable. They can take a few days to weeks to develop.\n* **Cat Scratch:** The cat scratch and subsequent antibiotic treatment further support the idea of a local immune response. Even with antibiotics, the initial scratch introduced bacteria and triggered an immune reaction.\n* **Tetanus Vaccination as a Strong Trigger:** Tetanus vaccines are particularly good at stimulating an immune response, and therefore can lead to more noticeable reactive lymph nodes.\n* **Your History:** Your history of Graves' Disease *and* recent carbimazole cessation complicates things, making you more aware of potential issues! It's good you're attuned to your body, but it also lends itself to worry.\n\n\n\n**Let's address your concerns about your bloodwork:**\n\n* **Low Lymphocytes (0.9):**  A lymphocyte count of 0.9 (assuming this is x 10^9/L) is *mildly* low. The normal range varies slightly between labs, but generally, it\u2019s around 1.0-4.8.  You\u2019ve been told this has been low for two years, which is significant. *However*, it is not drastically low.  It's good your endocrinologist is monitoring it, and it *could* be related to past carbimazole use (although neutrophils are normal, medications can have differing effects on different white blood cell lines).  Lymphocyte counts can fluctuate. \n* **Slightly Elevated Liver Value:** A single, slightly elevated liver value is also common and can have many benign causes (medication, mild inflammation, etc.). It's good to monitor it, but again, doesn\u2019t automatically indicate something serious.\n* **Carbimazole and Neutrophils:**  You're right to note neutrophils were normal before stopping carbimazole. This is reassuring as carbimazole can sometimes cause neutropenia (low neutrophils). That being said, it doesn't rule out medication-related effects on lymphocytes.\n\n**Why your anxiety about the node is understandable (and why you should still see a doctor):**\n\nYou're right to be checking this out. Supraclavicular nodes can be associated with more serious conditions, but *usually* those are accompanied by other symptoms like:\n\n* **Night sweats**\n* **Unexplained weight loss**\n* **Fever**\n* **Persistent, progressive enlargement of the node (over weeks, not days)**\n* **Hard, fixed nodes (not mobile)**\n\nYou haven\u2019t mentioned any of these, which is reassuring. \n\n**What your doctor will likely do:**\n\nYour doctor will likely:\n\n* **Physically examine the node:** Feel its size, consistency (soft vs. hard), and mobility (whether it moves under your skin). A soft, mobile node is generally less concerning.\n* **Ask about your symptoms:**  More details about the scratch, the shot, and any other changes you\u2019ve noticed.\n* **Possibly re-check your blood work:**  To see if the lymphocyte count and liver value have changed.\n* **May consider observation:** Given the recent vaccination and the scratch, they might recommend watching the node for a few weeks to see if it resolves on its own.\n* **Rarely, consider further investigation:** If the node doesn\u2019t improve or has concerning characteristics, they might order imaging (ultrasound) or, very rarely, a biopsy.\n\n\n\n**In the meantime, while you wait for your appointment:**\n\n* **Avoid excessive palpation (feeling) of the node.** Constant poking can cause inflammation and make it harder to assess.\n* **Continue to monitor for any other concerning symptoms:** Night sweats, fever, weight loss, etc.\n* **Practice relaxation techniques:**  Anxiety can make everything feel worse. Deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness can help.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\n**To summarize:** While it's excellent you're being vigilant, the most likely explanation is a reactive lymph node from the tetanus shot and recent cat scratch.  Your previous bloodwork findings are concerning enough to investigate, but don't necessarily point to a serious problem at this moment, especially in light of the recent events.  You are doing the right thing by having a doctor's appointment. You\u2019ve already thought through a lot of the important points \u2013 that's excellent!\n\n\n\n"

        "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really understandable worry, and you're right to be proactive about it. It's good you've already contacted your doctor, but waiting for a callback is stressful. Let's break this down, keeping in mind **I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice. This is information to help you understand the situation and what to look for, but it does not replace your doctor's guidance.**\n\n**Understanding Your Concern - Vimpat & Phenobarbital & Missed Doses**\n\n* **Vimpat (Lacosamide):** You're correct, Vimpat generally has a relatively short half-life (around 8-13 hours depending on individual factors). This means levels decline fairly quickly, making consistent dosing important. Being 15 hours late *does* mean the drug level was likely subtherapeutic for a period.\n* **Phenobarbital:** Phenobarbital has a much *longer* half-life (55-110 hours!). This means it stays in your system for a significant amount of time.  While Vimpat levels may have dipped, the Phenobarbital provides some continued coverage, which is a positive.\n* **Combined Effect:**  The fact you're on *both* meds is important. The Phenobarbital provides a buffer, though it doesn\u2019t eliminate the concern about Vimpat levels dropping.\n* **Individual Variation:**  Everyone metabolizes medication differently! Factors like your age, weight, kidney/liver function, other medications, and the specific type of epilepsy you have all play a role.\n* **Driving and Important Activities:** This adds a significant layer of concern, as a seizure during these activities could be dangerous.\n\n**Should You Be Worried? & Expect Something to Happen?**\n\nYes, it's *reasonable* to be worried, and to be vigilant. The degree of worry depends on a few key things:\n\n* **Your Seizure History:**  Have you had breakthrough seizures before with similar lapses in medication? If you've been consistently seizure-free for a long time, even with occasional missed doses (though you shouldn\u2019t aim for missed doses), that\u2019s a slightly more reassuring sign.  If you have frequent breakthrough seizures, this is a higher concern.\n* **Type of Epilepsy:**  Different epilepsy syndromes have different sensitivities to medication fluctuations.\n* **How Well Controlled Your Seizures Are Usually:** If your seizures are typically very well-controlled, even a slight dip in medication levels may be more noticeable.\n\n**It's *possible* you could experience a breakthrough seizure.** It's also *possible* everything will be fine.  Because of the Vimpat's shorter half-life, the *most* vulnerable period is likely the first 24-36 hours after the missed dose.  The Phenobarbital provides ongoing protection but isn't a perfect substitute for consistent Vimpat levels.\n\n\n\n**When Will You Know You're \"In the Clear\"?**\n\nThis is the hardest question. There\u2019s no magic number. Here's a breakdown of what to consider:\n\n* **24-48 Hours:**  The immediate period (first 24-48 hours) after taking the dose is when you should be most careful. This is when Vimpat levels are still building back up.\n* **72 Hours (3 Days):**  By 72 hours, if you\u2019ve taken your medication consistently, Vimpat levels should be *much* closer to therapeutic. This is a good point to start feeling a little more relaxed, *but still pay attention*.\n* **One Week:** After a week of consistent dosing, you're much more likely to be back to your baseline, *assuming your usual dosage is effective*.  However, everyone is different.\n* **Important: It's not about a specific time, but about *you* feeling normal and not experiencing any warning signs.**  (See \"What to Watch For\" below).\n\n**What to Do *Now* & What to Watch For**\n\n1. **Take your next dose as prescribed.**  Don't double-dose!\n2. **Strictly adhere to your medication schedule from now on.**  Consider setting multiple alarms (phone, vibrating alarm, etc.).  Medication reminders can also be very helpful.\n3. **Limit Risk Activities:** For the next few days (at least the first 72 hours), *strongly* consider limiting or postponing activities that could be dangerous if you were to have a seizure, especially driving.  If you *must* drive, be extra cautious and avoid long distances or challenging conditions.  This is really important.\n4. **Ask someone to check in on you:** Have a friend or family member know about the missed dose and check in with you, especially during the first 24-48 hours.\n5. **What to Watch For (and tell your doctor immediately):**\n    * **Aura:**  Any unusual sensations you experience *before* a seizure (e.g., strange smells, tastes, visual disturbances, deja vu, a rising feeling in your stomach). This is your brain signaling something is happening.\n    * **Muscle Twitching:** Any involuntary muscle jerks or spasms, especially if they are repetitive.\n    * **Staring Spells:**  Episodes of staring blankly, unresponsiveness, or altered awareness.\n    * **Confusion:**  Sudden confusion or difficulty speaking.\n    * **Headache:** An unusual or severe headache.\n    * **Any unusual changes in behavior or feelings.**\n\n**When Your Doctor Calls Back:**\n\nWhen your doctor calls, be prepared to tell them:\n\n* Exactly when you missed the dose and when you took it.\n* Any symptoms you've experienced since missing the dose.\n* Your seizure history.\n* Your concerns about driving/important activities.\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou're doing the right thing by being proactive and informed.  This is a scary situation, but it\u2019s also manageable.  Your doctor will be able to provide the most personalized advice based on your specific case.  Focus on taking your medication as prescribed going forward, watching for any warning signs, and minimizing risks until you feel confident your levels are stable again.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "28F. 5'8, 250lbs. White. History of epilepsy, asthma and vitamin D & B12 deficiency. Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably a really scary and confusing situation. An FSH of 122.2 at 28 is *very* high, and, as your doctor is doing, needs thorough investigation. Let's break down your questions and the possibilities, keeping in mind I am an AI and cannot give medical advice \u2013 this is for informational purposes only, and you *must* continue working with your doctor.\n\n**1. What are the chances my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again?**\n\nThis is the hardest question to answer.  Unfortunately, at an FSH level that high, the chances of spontaneous resumption of cycles are **low**. FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) is released by the pituitary gland and tells the ovaries to develop follicles (and ultimately produce estrogen).  When ovarian function declines, the pituitary releases *more* FSH in an attempt to stimulate the ovaries. A very high FSH level means the ovaries are likely not responding, and the pituitary is working overtime. \n\nWhile *some* fluctuations can occur, an FSH that high typically indicates a significant reduction in ovarian reserve (the number of eggs remaining). It doesn't mean *absolutely* no eggs are left, but the likelihood of them responding naturally is diminished.  It's important to understand that ovarian function doesn't just suddenly shut off completely; it's usually a gradual decline, but the level reaching 122.2 suggests a more accelerated decline.\n\nHowever, *don't give up all hope* until all tests are completed and discussed with your doctor. The estrogen levels are crucial.  Sometimes, even with high FSH, estrogen can still be within a normal range for a short period, but this is less common with levels this high.\n\n\n\n**2. What could cause this?**\n\nThere are several possibilities.  This is where further investigation is critical. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), formerly Premature Ovarian Failure:** This is the most likely scenario, given your FSH level. It means your ovaries have stopped working normally before age 40. It's not the same as early menopause, as it can sometimes be intermittent and there's a (small) chance of later regaining some function. Causes of POI are often unknown (idiopathic), but can include:\n    *   **Genetic factors:**  Family history of early menopause/POI, or specific genetic mutations (like Fragile X premutation).\n    *   **Autoimmune disease:** The body's immune system attacks the ovaries.  (You don\u2019t mention a current autoimmune diagnosis, but it\u2019s something to consider).\n    *   **Chemotherapy or Radiation:** If you've had these treatments, they can damage the ovaries.\n    *   **Infections:** Certain infections (like mumps) can sometimes affect ovarian function, though this is less common.\n    *   **Surgery:**  Ovarian surgery can sometimes impact reserve.\n*   **Turner Syndrome:** A chromosomal condition that affects female development.  This is usually diagnosed earlier in life, but mosaic forms can go undetected.\n*   **Certain Medical Conditions:**  Rarely, other medical conditions can contribute.\n*   **Iatrogenic cause:**  Could be related to a previous medical treatment.\n* **Epilepsy and Antiepileptic Drugs:**  Some studies suggest a possible link between epilepsy itself and earlier menopause, and some antiepileptic drugs (like lamotrigine) *may* have a potential effect on ovarian function. This is an area of ongoing research, and the link isn't fully understood, but it\u2019s important your doctor considers it.\n*   **Vitamin D/B12 Deficiency:** While less likely a *direct* cause of POI, severe deficiencies can disrupt hormonal balance and contribute to irregular cycles or other health issues. It\u2019s good you\u2019re addressing these!\n\n**3. Is there anything I should be worried about? Does this just happen sometimes?**\n\nYes, there are things to be aware of, and while POI can happen, it's *not* extremely common at 28. This is why a thorough workup is so important.\n\n**Things to be Worried About (and discuss with your doctor):**\n\n*   **Bone Health:**  Estrogen is crucial for bone density.  Low estrogen increases your risk of osteoporosis. You may need a bone density scan.\n*   **Cardiovascular Health:** Estrogen has a protective effect on the heart.  Lower estrogen levels can increase cardiovascular risk.\n*   **Infertility:** This is a major concern if you desire children.  Discuss fertility options with a reproductive endocrinologist.\n*   **Psychological Impact:**  Dealing with POI at a young age can be emotionally challenging.  Support groups and counseling can be very helpful.\n*   **Other Hormone-Related Symptoms:** You may experience hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood swings, sleep disturbances, and cognitive changes.\n*   **Associated Autoimmune Conditions:** Women with POI are at a slightly higher risk of developing certain autoimmune diseases.\n\n\n\n**Does it just happen sometimes?**\n\nYes, unfortunately, POI can happen seemingly \"out of the blue\" in some cases (idiopathic POI). However, it's crucial to rule out all other potential causes through testing and evaluation.\n\n\n\n**What should you do *now*?**\n\n1.  **Get your estrogen levels checked:**  This is what your doctor has already ordered, and it\u2019s vital.  Different types of estrogen may be measured (Estradiol, FSH, LH)\n2.  **Repeat FSH testing:** Retesting is essential to confirm the initial result. FSH levels can vary slightly, so a consistent high reading is more indicative of a problem.\n3.  **Ask about a karyotype:** A karyotype is a blood test that checks your chromosomes to rule out conditions like Turner syndrome.\n4.  **Discuss family history:**  Specifically, ask about the age of menopause in your mother and sisters.\n5.  **Consider referral to a Reproductive Endocrinologist:** A specialist in reproductive hormones will have the most expertise in diagnosing and managing POI.\n6. **Mention your medications:** Specifically, discuss the potential role your epilepsy and lamotrigine treatment may play in ovarian function\n7.  **Be your own advocate:** Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek second opinions, and push for the testing you feel is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Resources:**\n\n*   **The North American Menopause Society (NAMS):** [https://www.menopause.org/](https://www.menopause.org/)\n*   **POI Support Network:** [https://www.poisupport.org/](https://www.poisupport.org/)\n\n\n\nI know this is a lot of information. It\u2019s a lot to process. Remember to lean on your healthcare team for support and guidance.  Stay proactive in your care and ask all the questions you have.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "A few years back while In the military I had a freak accident until it stopped being that and continued to occur day after day. After some months I was diagnosed with epilepsy.In the beginning I was having 1-3 seizures a day while 2-4 of those were grand mal seizures a month. Medications didn\u2019t work and just seemed to make everything worse so my neurologist made the decision to not give me medications after having tried 5 of them.It\u2019s been a few years now and nowadays I get anywhere from 2-5? Every 4months and about 2 or 3 of those are grand mal seizures. A significant decrease but still ongoing. We never found a cause for the seizures.Well I\u2019m asking because a few months back I started noticing a few things that started worrying me. For example,    a few years back and at the beginning of this I used to be \u201csmart\u201d as in I could write any word no matter how big or small but in recent months I\u2019ve noticed I have a really hard time writing, as in spelling out words. I used to full on turn on autocorrect on my phone but nowadays I find myself almost completely depending on my phones autocorrect and looking up word spellings when even my phone can\u2019t tell what I\u2019m trying to say.    with writing again, for some reason I find myself forgetting or I don\u2019t know, not using simple words such as \u201cthe\u201d \u201cof\u201d \u201cto\u201d \u201cand\u201d \u201cfrom\u201d etc. or sometimes mistaking one word for another when there\u2019s no connection between the two    same thing as above but with speech. I never had any speed impediment or any speech disorder prior but now I find myself getting \u201cstuck\u201d while trying to say a word. It\u2019s to the point where it\u2019ll happen at least once with every full sentence I try to speak. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ll see it happening and I\u2019ll try to say the word again and I won\u2019t be able to, I\u2019ll need to dramatically slow down my speech and literally say it in segments    dramatic increase in repeatedly forgetting. I\u2019ll forget my keys, go back and get them, get there and forget what I was going to get or sometimes I\u2019ll forget I forgot. So I\u2019ll go back, then head back out and be like \u201cI went back for my keys and came back without my keys\u201d Male 23 5\u201911 185lbs first diagnosed at 20.

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and you're right to be concerned. It sounds like you've been through a lot with your epilepsy, and these new cognitive and speech changes are definitely something that needs to be investigated. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, potential causes, and what steps you should take, tailored to your situation as a veteran.  I will preface this by saying I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice - this is for informational purposes only.\n\n**Understanding the Concerns - Why This is Important**\n\n* **Subtle Seizure Activity:** Even with fewer *overt* grand mal seizures, it's possible to be experiencing *subclinical* (or non-convulsive) seizure activity. This means brain activity is disrupted by seizures, but it doesn't manifest in the classic shaking/loss of consciousness. Subclinical seizures can significantly impact cognitive function.  Given your history of cluster seizures and sometimes stopping breathing, this is a significant consideration.\n* **Epilepsy and Cognition:** Epilepsy frequently has cognitive side effects, even *between* seizures. These can include memory problems, language difficulties, and attention deficits. Your experiences align with these potential effects.\n* **Post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):**  Given your military service and the initial \"freak accident\" that preceded your diagnosis, the possibility of a mild or moderate TBI needs to be seriously considered.  Even if it seemed minor at the time, TBI can have long-term cognitive consequences, and it can sometimes *trigger* epilepsy.\n* **The Cumulative Effect:** Several years of seizures, even with decreasing frequency, can have a cumulative impact on brain function.\n* **The New Nature of Symptoms:**  The specific *type* of changes you are describing \u2013 the word-finding difficulties, the omission of common words, the getting \"stuck\" in speech \u2013 are particularly concerning for possible focal (localized) brain activity.\n\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes - What Your Doctor Will Be Considering**\n\n1. **Subclinical Seizure Activity:**  This is high on the list, given your history.\n2. **Focal Epilepsy:**  The changes you describe suggest the possibility that your epilepsy might be focal, meaning it originates in a specific area of the brain responsible for language. Even if you're having fewer grand mal seizures, a focal seizure might be subtly disrupting speech and word recall.\n3. **Post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):**  If the initial event had *any* component of head trauma, even if not immediately obvious, TBI could be contributing to the cognitive issues.  TBIs can be \"silent\" and have delayed effects.\n4. **Medication Effects:** Even though you're off medication, past medications could have had lingering effects. (Less likely, but worth mentioning.)\n5. **Psychological Factors:**  Stress, anxiety, and depression can worsen cognitive function. However, *given* the specific nature of your language and word-finding difficulties, psychological factors are less likely to be the primary cause but could be a contributing factor.\n6. **Other Neurological Conditions:**  Rarely, other neurological conditions could mimic epilepsy or co-occur with it.\n\n\n\n\n**What You NEED To Do - Action Steps**\n\n1. **Immediate Medical Evaluation:** *Do not delay.* You need a comprehensive neurological workup.  This is significantly more urgent than a \"routine\" checkup.  You need to discuss this with a neurologist *as soon as possible*.\n2. **Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare:** *This is essential.*  As a veteran, you are entitled to comprehensive healthcare through the VA. The VA has expertise in TBI, epilepsy, and the complexities of military-related health concerns.  Make an appointment with a neurologist *within* the VA system. They will be familiar with your military records and can consider the possibility of a link to your service.\n3. **Detailed Symptom Journal:**  Before your appointment, create a detailed journal documenting your symptoms. Include:\n   * **Specific Examples:**  Write down exact examples of the words you struggle with, when speech gets \"stuck,\" and instances of forgetting. The more specific you are, the better the neurologist can assess the problem.\n   * **Frequency:**  How often do these symptoms occur?\n   * **Timing:**  Do they happen more at certain times of day? Are they worse after seizures?\n   * **Triggers:**  Have you noticed anything that seems to worsen the symptoms (stress, fatigue, specific activities)?\n4. **Neurological Tests:**  Expect the neurologist to order several tests, which may include:\n   * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  To look for abnormal brain activity, including subclinical seizures. *Crucially*, they may recommend a prolonged EEG (24-72 hours or even longer) to increase the chances of capturing subtle seizure activity.\n   * **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  To look for structural abnormalities in the brain, such as scarring from a TBI or lesions associated with epilepsy.\n   * **Neuropsychological Testing:**  This is a series of tests that assess different cognitive functions, including memory, language, attention, and executive functions. This will help pinpoint *specifically* what cognitive areas are affected.\n   * **Cognitive Assessments:** Simple tests during the exam to assess impulse control, short/long-term memory, and other possible symptoms.\n5. **Discuss Your Cluster Seizures:**  Emphasize to the neurologist the history of cluster seizures and the instances where you stopped breathing. This is a very important piece of information.\n6. **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to ask questions and express your concerns.  If you feel like you're not being taken seriously, or if you're not getting answers, seek a second opinion.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources for Veterans**\n\n* **Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare:**  [https://www.va.gov/health-care/](https://www.va.gov/health-care/)\n* **Brainline:**  A resource for TBI information: [https://www.brainline.org/](https://www.brainline.org/)\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:**  [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **Department of Veterans Affairs TBI/Polytrauma System of Care**: [https://www.polytrauma.va.gov/](https://www.polytrauma.va.gov/)\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Don't Drive:**  Until you have a clear understanding of what's going on and your seizure control is fully evaluated, avoid driving.\n* **Safety Precautions:**  Take precautions to avoid situations where a seizure could be dangerous (swimming alone, working at heights, etc.).\n* **Support System:**  Lean on your family and friends for support.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve demonstrated your strength in navigating a difficult situation.  Now, taking proactive steps to address these new symptoms is critical for your long-term well-being.  Please prioritize getting a thorough medical evaluation through the VA. Good luck, and I hope you get some answers and a plan to manage these challenges."

        "question": "Age/Sex: 20M Height: 5' 10\" Weight: 175 lbs About a month ago I swallowed roughly 42 grams of keppra. I eventually vomited, fell asleep, and woke up feeling pretty normal. I'm curious if there should be any hidden Long-term Health effects caused by my consumption of that much keppra that may not be obvious such as kidney, liver, or brain problems. Additionally, I am curious how likely it is I would have died from consuming that much Keppra and if a death from keppra would be painful.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a serious situation, even though you felt relatively okay afterward.  You ingested a *very* large dose of Levetiracetam (Keppra). Here's a breakdown of potential long-term effects, the likelihood of death, and what a fatal overdose might be like, along with *very strong* advice about seeking medical evaluation.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response.**\n\n**First: This is Not Medical Advice.  You *need* to be evaluated by a doctor.**  I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations. I'm providing information to help you understand the seriousness of the situation and why professional medical attention is crucial.  The fact you vomited is good, but doesn't rule out potential harm.\n\n\n\n**1. Potential Long-Term Health Effects**\n\nWhile you felt \"normal\" waking up, that's deceptive.  Levetiracetam's effects are complex, and delayed consequences are possible.  Here's a look at the organs of concern:\n\n*   **Kidneys:**  Levetiracetam is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.  A large dose forces the kidneys to work *extremely* hard. While acute kidney failure immediately after ingestion is more common,  subtle, long-term damage is possible. This could manifest as reduced kidney function over time, increasing your risk of hypertension, and other kidney-related issues.  There might be no noticeable symptoms for a long time.\n*   **Liver:**  While less directly affected than the kidneys, the liver is involved in drug metabolism.  A massive dose means the liver had to process a huge amount, and while Levetiracetam is generally considered liver-safe, that overload adds stress.  Long-term, this could *potentially* contribute to liver strain.\n*   **Brain/Neurological:**  This is a major concern. Keppra directly affects brain activity.  While it's used to *treat* neurological conditions, a huge, sudden dose can cause:\n    *   **Cognitive Issues:**  Difficulties with memory, concentration, and thinking clearly. These can be subtle and develop gradually.\n    *   **Mood Changes:**  Irritability, anxiety, depression, or even more significant psychiatric symptoms.  These are surprisingly common side effects, even at normal doses, and a large dose could exacerbate them.\n    *   **Neuropathies:** Though less common with Keppra than some other anti-epileptics, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage causing pain, numbness, or weakness) is a possibility.\n    *   **Seizures (Paradoxical):** Ironically, a very large dose in someone not already taking it for epilepsy could *trigger* seizures in rare cases.\n*   **Psychiatric Effects:** Keppra is known to have psychiatric side effects even at normal doses. A large overdose can worsen these risks, including agitation, depression, anxiety, and even psychosis.\n*   **Cardiac Effects:** While not as common, high levels of Levetiracetam can, in rare cases, impact heart rhythm.\n\n**2. Likelihood of Death**\n\nIt's honestly difficult to give a precise probability.  Several factors influence whether 42 grams of Keppra would be fatal:\n\n*   **Individual Metabolism:**  People metabolize drugs at different rates.\n*   **Time to Vomiting:** The fact that you vomited *reduced* the amount absorbed. However, a significant amount was likely still absorbed before vomiting occurred.\n*   **Underlying Health Conditions:**  Pre-existing kidney or liver problems would dramatically increase the risk.\n*   **Other Medications/Substances:**  Any other drugs or alcohol consumed concurrently could interact and worsen the effects.\n\n**However, 42 grams is a *very* high dose.**  A typical therapeutic dose is usually between 500mg to 2000mg per day. You ingested roughly 21-84 times a typical daily dose. **It is very fortunate you survived.**  \n\nWhile not *guaranteed* to be fatal, this dose significantly elevates the risk of serious complications and *could* have been lethal.  Hospitalization and aggressive supportive care (IV fluids, monitoring, etc.) would be essential to manage such an overdose.\n\n**3. What Would a Fatal Keppra Overdose Be Like?**\n\nA fatal overdose wouldn't necessarily be a dramatic, instantly painful event.  It's more likely to be a progressive decline. Here's a likely scenario:\n\n*   **Initial Symptoms:**  Severe drowsiness, confusion, slowed breathing, potentially seizures.\n*   **Progression:**  As the brain is increasingly affected, loss of consciousness, coma.  The kidneys would likely begin to shut down.\n*   **Cause of Death:**  Typically, death would result from respiratory failure (stopping breathing) or complications from kidney failure.  Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) is another possibility, but less common.\n*   **Pain:**  The person may not feel significant *pain* in the final stages due to being unconscious. However, the preceding symptoms (seizures, if they occur) could be frightening and distressing.  The body's struggle to maintain vital functions would be internally stressful, even if not consciously perceived.\n\n\n\n**Crucial Next Steps \u2013 *You Must Do These***\n\n1.  **Go to the Emergency Room Immediately:**  Do not delay.  Tell them you ingested 42 grams of Keppra approximately one month ago and are concerned about potential long-term effects.  Be honest about everything.  They will likely order:\n    *   **Comprehensive Blood Tests:**  To assess kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and drug levels.\n    *   **Urine Analysis:**  To check for kidney damage.\n    *   **Neurological Examination:**  To assess cognitive function, reflexes, and nerve health.\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** To evaluate heart function.\n    *   **Possible Brain Imaging (MRI/CT Scan):** If neurological symptoms are present.\n2.  **Be Honest with the Medical Professionals:**  Do not minimize the amount you took. Full disclosure is essential for accurate assessment and treatment.\n3. **Follow-up Care:** You'll likely need follow-up appointments with a neurologist and possibly a nephrologist (kidney specialist) to monitor your health long-term.\n\n**Regarding why you took the Keppra:** I understand this is a sensitive issue, and I won't press for details. However, if this was a suicide attempt or related to mental health struggles, please know there is help available. Here are some resources:\n\n*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada, or dial 111 in the UK.\n*   **The Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.\n*   **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth).\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex case, given your extensive medical history. You're right to be proactive in seeking answers and not just accepting \"I don't know.\"  The recurring tongue lesions with the described progression (red, painful, white ring, white tongue, dysgeusia) are concerning and need a proper diagnosis. Let's break down possibilities and which specialist to see.\n\n**Understanding the Possibilities**\n\nGiven your diagnoses, here's how each could potentially relate, as well as some other considerations:\n\n* **Crohn's Disease:**  While Crohn's often manifests in the GI tract, it *can* have oral manifestations. These are usually aphthous ulcers (canker sores) or linear ulcers.  However, your description doesn't *perfectly* align with typical Crohn's mouth sores.  The location (specifically the pattern on your tongue), the concentric ring, and the progression are less classic for Crohn's. It's still POSSIBLE, especially with systemic inflammation. \n* **SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) & Neurolupus:** Lupus is notorious for affecting multiple organ systems, and oral manifestations are quite common.  These can include:\n    * **Lupus-related ulcers:** Similar to Crohn's, these can be painful.\n    * **Oral discoid lupus:**  This causes red, scaly patches, but often doesn\u2019t have the ring-like progression you describe.\n    * **Dry mouth (Xerostomia):** Common in Lupus (and often a side-effect of medication), can increase susceptibility to irritation and secondary infections.\n    * **Vasculitis:** Lupus can cause inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) which could theoretically affect the tongue.  (This is more concerning and requires investigation).\n* **Epilepsy & Medications:** Your extensive medication list is a key consideration.  Several of your drugs have potential oral side effects:\n    * **Levetiracetam, Lacosamide, Perampanel, Gabapentin:**  These anticonvulsants are known to occasionally cause oral discomfort, altered taste, and (less commonly) mucositis.\n    * **Hydroxychloroquine:** Though less common, oral side effects of hydroxychloroquine can occur.\n    * **Methylprednisolone:**  Steroids can increase the risk of oral fungal infections (thrush), which can sometimes present as white patches. While you describe a 'ring' before the white patches, it's something to consider. (A classic thrush presentation is only white, without the red ring)\n    * **Pantoprazole:** While aimed at protecting the stomach, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) *can* alter the oral microbiome and potentially increase the risk of fungal infections.\n* **Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN):** SFN affects the small nerve fibers, potentially causing pain and altered sensation. While not typically *causing* lesions, it could influence the *perception* of pain from a mild oral irritation, making it feel more intense.\n* **Other Considerations (Less Likely, but Need Ruling Out):**\n    * **Geographic Tongue:** This causes irregular red patches that can shift over time.  It's typically painless, but some people experience sensitivity. The pattern doesn't quite match your described progression, but it\u2019s worth considering.\n    * **Oral Lichen Planus:**  This is an inflammatory condition affecting mucous membranes.  It can cause white, lacy patches or red, swollen tissues.\n    * **Vitamin Deficiencies:** (B12, iron, folate) Can contribute to oral problems, though the specific pattern you describe is less typical.\n\n\n\n**Which Doctor to See?  The Order of Operations**\n\nBecause of your complicated medical history, a multi-pronged approach may be best, but I recommend this order:\n\n1. **Oral Medicine Specialist (Crucial First Step):**  This is *the* specialist for problems within the mouth.  They will have the best understanding of oral lesions and can perform a thorough examination, possibly including a biopsy.  *Don\u2019t settle for a general dentist.* Look specifically for someone with specialized training in oral medicine or oral pathology.  They can differentiate between the possibilities and take appropriate action.  Search for these specialists within your area \u2013 often associated with university hospitals.\n2. **Rheumatologist (Concurrent):**  Inform your Rheumatologist about these lesions. They need to be aware of any new symptoms to assess for lupus flares or unusual manifestations. They might want to re-check some lupus-related blood work.\n3. **Gastroenterologist (potentially):**  If the oral medicine specialist is leaning towards a Crohn\u2019s connection, your gastroenterologist should be updated.\n4. **Neurologist (As needed):** If SFN is thought to be playing a role in pain perception, discuss with your neurologist.\n\n\n\n\n**What to Tell the Doctor (Prepare a Detailed History)**\n\n* **Very detailed description:**  Describe the size, shape, color change, and pain characteristics of the lesions. The progression you detailed (red -> ring -> white) is important.\n* **Timing:** When did they start?  How often do they occur?  How long do they last?\n* **Triggers:**  Is there anything that seems to make them worse (certain foods, stress, time of month)?\n* **Medication List:**  Bring a *complete* list of all medications, dosages, and how long you've been on them.\n* **Medical History:**  Summarize your Crohn's, SLE, epilepsy, and SFN, including any recent flares or changes in your condition.\n* **Pictures:** Bring the photos you provided.\n* **Oral Hygiene Routine:** Describe your brushing and flossing routine.\n* **Dietary Habits:** Mention anything unusual in your diet.\n\n\n\n**Tips for Pain Relief (While Awaiting Diagnosis)**\n\nThese are palliative measures *only* and don't address the underlying cause.  Discuss these with your doctor:\n\n* **Warm Salt Water Rinses:** Several times a day.  This can soothe irritation.\n* **Avoid Irritants:**  Spicy foods, acidic beverages, alcohol, and tobacco can worsen the pain. \n* **Soft Diet:**  Stick to soft, bland foods that are easy to chew and swallow.\n* **Chlorhexidine Mouthwash (Prescription):**  Your doctor might prescribe this to reduce bacteria in the mouth, *but use it only as directed* as long-term use can stain teeth.\n* **Topical Anesthetics (with caution):** Products like benzocaine (Orajel) can provide temporary relief, but prolonged use isn\u2019t recommended, and some people are allergic.\n* **Magnesium Supplementation:** (Discuss with your doctor!). Magnesium deficiency can sometimes contribute to nerve pain and muscle sensitivity. *Don't self-treat with high doses.*\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\n**Don't Give Up!**  You've already taken the important step of recognizing this isn't a \"normal\" occurrence.

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *hugely* frustrating and frightening situation for your family, and I completely understand why you're reaching out and seeking any possible insight. It's awful that Fiona is suffering so much and that doctors seem to be dismissing her very real symptoms. You are right to question things and advocate for her. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, possible considerations, and what your family might push for. I'll try to be thorough, but remember: **I am not a medical professional, and this is not a diagnosis. This is an exploration of possibilities to help your family ask the right questions.**\n\n**Let's break down the concerns:**\n\n* **Prolonged Symptoms:** The length of time this has been going on (since January 2021) is significant.  Typically, if something is purely medication-induced, symptoms lessen *after* stopping the medication. The fact that they've worsened, and persist, points to something more.\n* **Complex Symptom Set:**  It's *not* just headaches. It's the combination of:\n    * **Migraine-like headaches with light sensitivity.**\n    * **Loss of sensation/numbness in legs.**\n    * **Shaking/twitching.**\n    * **Breathing difficulty.**\n    * **Feeling hot.**\n    * **Prolonged episodes (10+ minutes, sometimes 50!).**  This is a key factor that makes it *less* likely to be a simple migraine or psychological in origin.\n    * **Timing:** The predictability of episodes around 6:30 PM suggests a physiological trigger, not random psychological distress.\n* **Dismissive Medical Responses:**  The consistent downplaying of her symptoms, and blaming medication (especially a small dosage of Tylenol), or attributing to psychological issues is deeply concerning. Jumping to a psychological diagnosis without thorough investigation is inappropriate, particularly considering the physical symptoms.  This is, unfortunately, not uncommon, but it's incredibly damaging to the patient and creates huge anxiety for the family.\n* **Multiple ER Visits & Lack of Resolution:** The repeated cycles of going to the ER, being sent home without a diagnosis, and then needing to return are a clear indication that something is seriously wrong.\n\n\n\n**Possible Considerations (What *could* be going on?  Again, NOT a diagnosis):**\n\nI'm going to categorize these to make it easier to follow. **It's possible multiple things are playing a role.**\n\n**1. Neurological Possibilities (Beyond Typical Epilepsy):**\n\n*   **Non-Epileptic Seizure Disorder (NESD)/Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**  This is what doctors *may* be leaning towards.  However, it's not simply \"all in her head.\" PNES can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or underlying medical conditions. *However*, the prolonged duration and the specific physical symptoms (leg numbness, breathing difficulties, feeling hot) would be less typical, and they usually aren't consistently timed.  It\u2019s important to rule *everything else* out before considering this.\n* **Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS):** While typically associated with severe nausea and vomiting, some CVS presentations include neurological symptoms and can resemble seizure-like activity.  The timed nature of the episodes could align with CVS.\n* **Migraine Variants:** There are different types of migraines.  Some can present with neurological deficits beyond headache, like weakness, numbness, or confusion. *Hemiplegic Migraines* cause weakness on one side of the body and can mimic stroke-like symptoms.\n* **Genetic or Rare Neurological Conditions:**  There are many rare genetic conditions that can cause episodic neurological symptoms. These would require specialized genetic testing to identify. Examples include some mitochondrial disorders, periodic paralysis, or channelopathies.\n* **Subtle Seizure Activity:**  Sometimes seizures don't present with the \"classic\" convulsions.  Focal seizures (starting in one part of the brain) can manifest as unusual sensations, twitching, or altered awareness.  Even if a standard EEG hasn't caught anything, *intermittent* or *subtle* seizure activity can be missed.\n\n**2.  Other Medical Considerations:**\n\n* **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Problems with the autonomic nervous system (which controls things like heart rate, breathing, and temperature) can cause a wide range of symptoms, including dizziness, weakness, and changes in body temperature. \n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** This condition affects blood flow and can cause fainting, dizziness, and other symptoms that could be mistaken for neurological problems.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope:**  While typically causing fainting with slower heart rate, atypical presentations can involve shaking or twitching.\n* **Underlying Infection or Inflammatory Condition:**  Less likely given the chronic nature, but worth considering are conditions that cause inflammation in the brain or nervous system.\n\n\n\n\n**What Your Family Needs to Do (Advocacy is Crucial):**\n\n1.  **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Keep a meticulous diary of *every* episode.  Include:\n    *   Exact time of onset and duration.\n    *   Specific symptoms (be as detailed as possible).\n    *   What she was doing *immediately* before the episode.\n    *   Anything that seems to trigger or worsen the episode.\n    *   Any medications taken.\n    *   Food intake before the event.\n2.  **Second (and Third!) Opinions:** You're already doing this by going to Philadelphia. *Don't stop*.  Seek specialists:\n    *   **Neurologist (Specifically one specializing in Epilepsy/Seizure Disorders):** Even if they say it's not epilepsy, a highly skilled epileptologist can rule it out definitively. *Specifically request prolonged EEG monitoring (24-72 hours, or even longer) including video monitoring.* This is crucial.\n    *   **Pediatric Neurologist:** Important for a young patient.\n    *   **Pediatrician with a Strong Interest in Neurology:**  A good pediatrician can be a strong advocate.\n    *   **Geneticist:**  To explore the possibility of a genetic condition.\n    *    **Autonomic Specialist:** if autonomic dysfunction is suspect.\n3.  **Push for Comprehensive Testing:**\n    *   **Repeated EEGs:** As mentioned, long-term video EEG monitoring is *essential*.\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:**  A detailed MRI can rule out structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Blood Tests:**  A complete blood panel, including tests for inflammation, infection, metabolic disorders, and genetic markers.\n    *   **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):**  To rule out infections or inflammation of the central nervous system.\n    *   **Cardiac Monitoring:** To rule out any underlying cardiac issues.\n\n4.  **Bring a Detailed Summary to Appointments:**  Don\u2019t rely solely on memory.  Have a typed, organized summary of the entire history, timeline, symptoms, and previous tests.  Include the symptom diary.\n5. **Record Episodes:** If possible (and safe), record videos of the episodes. This can be invaluable for doctors who haven\u2019t witnessed them firsthand.\n6. **Trust Your Instincts:**  You know Fiona best. If you feel something is being dismissed or overlooked, *speak up*.  Don't be afraid to demand further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Resources:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) (Even if it's not epilepsy, they have valuable information.)\n*   **Rare Disease Organizations:**  Look for organizations specific to any conditions you suspect (e.g., mitochondrial disease, CVS).\n*   **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS):**  [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/)\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint.  It will take persistence, research, and advocacy to get Fiona the answers she deserves.  Don't give up, and don\u2019t be afraid to seek help and support from other families facing similar challenges. You are doing the right thing by seeking information and questioning the current medical approach.  I sincerely hope Fiona gets a diagnosis and treatment soon.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably a very stressful time, and it's good you're trying to gather information before your neurologist appointment. Let's break down the MRI findings and try to address your questions.  I will preface this by saying I am an AI and *cannot* give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and should not substitute a conversation with his neurologist.\n\n**Understanding the MRI Report:**\n\n* **\"Interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele...\"** This confirms the prior surgery was successfully done.  The tegmen mastoideum is a section of bone at the base of the skull, and the encephalocele was a protrusion through that area.\n* **\"...with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri.\"** This is the key finding. Let's unpack those terms:\n    * **Encephalomalacia:**  This means \"softening of the brain.\" It's an area of tissue that has become damaged or atrophied (shrunk). It often occurs after an injury, stroke, or surgery where blood supply was disrupted. In this case, it's near the prior resection (surgical removal) site.\n    * **Gliosis:** This is scarring within the brain.  It's the brain's natural response to injury.  When brain tissue is damaged, glial cells (support cells) proliferate and form a scar. This is *often* seen alongside encephalomalacia.\n* **\"Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.\"** This is good news. The amygdala and hippocampus are important for memory and emotional processing, and they appear normal on this scan. The fact they are not significantly impacted is positive.\n* **\"No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"** This is reassuring. It means they don't see a new tumor, any concerning areas that \"light up\" on the scan (indicating inflammation or growth), or any obvious areas that are causing seizures in other parts of the brain.\n\n\n\n\n**Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected?**\n\n**Yes, some degree of encephalomalacia and gliosis is very common, even *expected*, after brain surgery and particularly after removing an encephalocele.**  Removing anything from the brain causes some degree of trauma to the surrounding tissue.  The vessels that supply that tissue are disrupted and even if restored, it's rare to have perfect recovery. The gliosis is the remodeling phase of that disrupted tissue.\n\n* **However, the *amount* matters.** The report says \"small region.\" That's better than a large region.  But \"small\" is relative, and its location matters (which is why it\u2019s near the hippocampus, important for seizure control, which suggests the location is somewhat concerning).\n\n**What does this suggest about treatment? Will it be more meds or surgery?**\n\nThis is the big question, and unfortunately, I can't definitively answer it.  Here's a breakdown of possibilities, assuming they want to control the seizures:\n\n* **Medication Adjustment:** This is the most likely first step. The fact that he's had a seizure despite being off medication for a while suggests that he likely needs *some* level of antiepileptic drug (AED) to control seizure activity.  Increasing the Vimpat dosage or adding another AED are very real possibilities.  The goal is to find the lowest effective dose with minimal side effects. This is a very common approach.\n\n* **Further Investigation/Refined EEG:** The neurologist may want a more detailed EEG (electroencephalogram) to pinpoint *exactly* where the seizure activity is originating.  Sometimes, even if the MRI shows a potential area, the EEG can provide more precise localization.  Sometimes, a longer-term EEG monitoring session (using video EEG) is needed to capture a seizure and correlate it with the MRI findings.\n\n* **Surgery (Less Likely Initially):** While not the first line, another surgery *could* be considered in certain situations.  However, it's often reserved for cases where medications are not effective and the seizures are significantly impacting quality of life.  The decision to consider surgery would depend on:\n    * **Precise seizure location:** Finding a very specific, well-defined epileptogenic zone.\n    * **His overall health:** His age and general medical condition.\n    * **Risks vs. Benefits:** Weighing the risks of another brain surgery against the potential for seizure freedom.\n   Given the location near vital structures (hippocampus), another surgery would be a significant consideration.  It's not something they'd jump to lightly.\n\n* **Neurostimulation (Potential, but less common as a first step):** In some cases, devices like Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) can be implanted to detect and disrupt seizure activity before it spreads. This is less common but may come into play if meds aren\u2019t sufficient.\n\n\n\n**Additional Thoughts & What to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n* **Connection to Craniosynostosis/Prior Craniofacial Surgery:**  You mentioned his past craniosynostosis and craniofacial surgery. While the encephalocele is the *current* focus, don\u2019t hesitate to ask the neurologist if his prior surgeries may have any relevance to the new findings or the risk of seizures.  The altered skull shape and potential impact on brain development *could* be a factor.\n* **The \"Why\" of the Encephalomalacia:** Ask them *why* they think the encephalomalacia developed. Was it from the initial surgery? Has it progressed since the original surgery?  Is there any evidence of subtle blood vessel changes contributing?\n* **Severity of the Encephalomalacia:**  \u201cSmall\u201d is subjective.  Ask for more details on the size and exact location of the area.\n* **Prognosis:** What is the expected trajectory of the encephalomalacia?  Is it likely to worsen over time, or is it stable?\n* **Seizure Type:** What type of seizure did he have? (tonic-clonic) This will help them tailor treatment.\n* **Medication Side Effects:** Discuss potential side effects of increasing Vimpat or adding another medication.\n* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Get guidance on things he can do to minimize seizure risk (sleep, stress management, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n**In summary:**  The MRI shows a change, but it's not necessarily catastrophic. It\u2019s more likely, at least initially, that your husband will need medication adjustment. The fact that he was seizure-free for two years is encouraging.  Prepare a list of questions for the neurologist, and don't be afraid to ask for clarification on anything you don't understand.  \n\n\n\nI truly hope this information is helpful.  I know waiting a week feels like an eternity.  Try to focus on what you *can* control \u2013 preparing for the appointment and supporting your husband.  \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "42 F Lamictal, cymbalta, singulair, levothyroxine, Pepcid, ambien 200lbs (significant weight gain in 3 years after injury to cervical spine - unable to run like I used to so I\u2019m confident that is the main reason why) 3-4 drinks per year, past prescription drug use (all prescribed but over used/abused) no addictive medications for almost 2 years besides ambien but now I\u2019m very careful. Quit smoking cigarettes 1 year ago. Use juul 5% nicotine 1-2 pods per day. History: postpartum psychosis, depression, epilepsy, hashimotos, reynauds, allergy induced asthma, thoracic aneurysm, insomnia Last year I made an appointment with a new family doctor due to a move. I was very open and honest about all past health issues and casually asked about my fainting spells. This is an issue that was ongoing since I was 12. After many tests they determined it is epilepsy. It seems to be well controlled now that I\u2019m medicated and I haven\u2019t had an episode/seizure for 10 months. In those months I\u2019ve noticed I started to \u201cfeel things I see\u201d. It\u2019s so bizarre and hard to really explain. When I\u2019m really engrossed in a program or movie and I see someone hug, get hurt, temp changes, even sex, I lightly feel the sensation. If I see certain places (like a national geo program) I can smell and feel the environment. I did ask my neurologist about it and she said that she didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a seizure but it\u2019s strange how it started after they are controlled. My question is about synesthesia and if it\u2019s something that is just pseudoscience or if there is concrete evidence on it? Could this be a mental disorder manifesting that will eventually take a downward turn? I have no complaints about the sensations because they are actually pleasant but it does scare me that they aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. Thanks to all the doctors who visit this sub and offer help!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a fascinating and complex presentation. You've given a very thorough history, which is incredibly helpful. Let's break down the potential explanations for what you're experiencing, addressing your questions about synesthesia, its scientific basis, potential for worsening, and other possibilities given your history.  I'll provide a detailed response, but **please remember this is not a substitute for a medical evaluation.  This is for informational purposes only, and you should continue to work closely with your medical team.**\n\n**1. Synesthesia: Pseudoscience or Real Neurological Phenomenon?**\n\nYou're right to question whether synesthesia is \"real.\" For a long time, it *was* dismissed as anecdotal and potentially psychological. However, **synesthesia is now recognized as a legitimate neurological phenomenon with a growing body of scientific evidence supporting it.** It\u2019s not a mental illness, but a difference in brain wiring, specifically connectivity.\n\n*   **What it *is*:**  Synesthesia literally means \"joined sensation.\"  It's a neurological condition where stimulation of one sense triggers an automatic, involuntary experience in another sense.  Classic examples include:\n    *   **Grapheme-color synesthesia:**  Seeing letters or numbers as inherently colored.\n    *   **Sound-color synesthesia:**  Experiencing colors when hearing sounds.\n    *   **Lexical-gustatory synesthesia:**  Tasting shapes or words.\n*   **How it's studied:**  Neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG) have shown that synesthetes have different brain activity patterns than non-synesthetes. These patterns demonstrate increased cross-activation between brain areas typically associated with different senses. Some theories suggest it\u2019s due to reduced pruning of neuronal connections in early development.\n*   **Prevalence:** Estimates vary, but it's thought to affect around 2-4% of the population.  It often runs in families, suggesting a genetic component.\n\n**However, what you're describing isn't a \"classic\" synesthesia.**  The typical forms are much more consistent and automatic (e.g., the letter 'A' *always* evokes the color red).  Your experience is more complex, triggered by emotional and environmental scenes in visual media, and involves complex sensations (touch, smell, temperature). This is why simply labeling it \"synesthesia\" is likely too simplistic.\n\n**2. Your Specific Experience:  Possible Explanations**\n\nGiven your history, here's a breakdown of potential explanations, roughly from most to least likely, and how they relate to your concerns:\n\n*   **Post-ictal Phenomena & Neurological Reorganization:** This is perhaps the *most* likely explanation, given your epilepsy history. You mentioned it started after seizure control.  \"Post-ictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.  While you haven't had seizures in 10 months, the brain undergoes significant reorganization *after* prolonged seizure activity.  It's possible that controlling the epilepsy has revealed a latent neurological pattern, or triggered a change in how your brain processes sensory information.  This post-ictal phenomenon can sometimes manifest as unusual sensory experiences that aren't seizures themselves.  This can be temporary or long lasting.\n*   **Enhanced Empathy/Emotional Contagion:** You described feeling sensations related to emotional events (hugs, injury, sex).  Some individuals are highly empathetic and experience a strong emotional resonance with others.  This can sometimes translate into *physiological* sensations.  However, your descriptions of smelling and feeling environments are less typical of pure emotional contagion.\n*   **Atypical Synesthesia:**  While not classic, it's possible you're experiencing a less common form of synesthesia, where complex scenes and emotions trigger multi-sensory experiences. This is particularly true if the sensations are vivid and consistent.\n*   **Medication Effects:** Several of your medications can have neurological side effects. While unlikely to *cause* this exact phenomenon, it's important to consider.\n    *   **Lamictal:**  Can sometimes cause neurological symptoms, although usually different in nature.\n    *   **Cymbalta:** (SNRI) Can affect serotonin and norepinephrine levels, which could potentially influence sensory perception.\n    *   **Ambien:** Can have complex effects on sleep architecture and potentially on other brain functions.\n*   **Residual Impact of Postpartum Psychosis:** Postpartum psychosis is a serious condition. While you're currently stable, previous episodes of psychosis can sometimes leave lingering subtle cognitive or perceptual changes.\n*   **Anxiety/Stress:**  Although you state the sensations are mostly pleasant, underlying anxiety could be contributing. Stress can heighten sensory awareness.\n*   **Rarely:  Early Manifestation of Another Neurological Condition:** Given your aneurysm history, it's important to be vigilant for any new or worsening neurological symptoms.  However, your stable seizure control and the nature of these sensations make this less likely in the immediate term.\n\n**3.  Could it be a Mental Disorder Manifesting That Will Eventually Take a Downward Turn?**\n\nThis is understandably your main concern.  **Based on what you've described, it does *not* sound like a typical manifestation of a worsening mental illness.**  The fact that you find the sensations pleasant, rather than distressing, is a significant point. *However*, because of your history of psychosis, you absolutely need to be vigilant and report any changes.\n\nHere's what to watch for that could suggest a developing problem:\n\n*   **Distress:** If the sensations become unpleasant, frightening, or overwhelming.\n*   **Disruption:** If they start to interfere with your daily life, concentration, or functioning.\n*   **Hallucinatory Quality:** If the experiences become more vivid, bizarre, or detached from reality (e.g., seeing or hearing things that aren't present).\n*   **Accompanying Mood Changes:**  If you experience worsening depression, anxiety, or other mood symptoms alongside the sensations.\n*   **New Neurological Symptoms:**  Any new headaches, weakness, numbness, or cognitive difficulties.\n\n\n\n**4.  What Should You Do?**\n\n*   **Continue working with your neurologist:**  You've already taken the crucial step of discussing this with her.  Keep her updated on any changes in the sensations. Ask specifically if there is any consideration of EEG to look for subclinical activity.\n*   **Discuss with your psychiatrist:**  Given your history of postpartum psychosis, it's crucial for your psychiatrist to be aware of these sensations. They can help assess whether they are related to your previous condition or a new development.\n*   **Consider a neuropsychological evaluation:** A neuropsychologist can perform a detailed assessment of your cognitive and sensory functions and help distinguish between different potential causes. These tests can be highly specialized and insightful.\n*   **Keep a detailed diary:**  Record the specific triggers, the type of sensations you experience, their intensity, and any associated emotions or thoughts.  This will be extremely helpful for your doctors.\n* **Address the Juul:** While you\u2019ve quit smoking, nicotine is still a stimulant and can affect neurological function. Reducing or eliminating Juul use might be helpful.\n\n\n\n**In conclusion:** Your experience is unusual and deserves careful evaluation. While it sounds most likely to be related to neurological reorganization after seizure control (potentially a post-ictal phenomenon), other possibilities need to be considered. The fact that the sensations are currently pleasant is reassuring, but ongoing monitoring and open communication with your medical team are essential.  Don't hesitate to seek further evaluation if you have any concerns.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, I understand you're anxious about the new findings on your MRI, especially given your history of temporal lobe epilepsy and increased headaches.  It's good you're asking for clarification! I'll break down the \"Brain\" and \"Impression\" sections, explaining what they mean in plain language, and then address how they relate to *your* specific situation, as best I can *without being a medical professional and therefore providing medical advice*.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response \u2013 it is very important.**\n\n**Let's start with the \"Brain\" Findings:**\n\n* **\"No mass effect or edema.\"** This is *good news*.  \"Mass effect\" means something isn't pushing on brain structures, and \"edema\" means there's no swelling.  Both could indicate a more serious problem like a tumor or significant inflammation.\n* **\"No significant atrophy or chronic microvascular ischemic changes.\"**  This is also reassuring. \"Atrophy\" means brain tissue shrinking, which can happen with age or certain conditions. \"Chronic microvascular ischemic changes\" refers to small areas of damage due to reduced blood flow over time. The report says these aren't significant, which is positive.\n* **\"Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right.\"** This is the key finding that's likely causing your worry. Let's break this down:\n    * **\"Punctate foci\"** means small, dot-like areas.\n    * **\"White matter\"** is the part of the brain containing nerve fibers that connect different areas.\n    * **\"T2/FLAIR\"**  These are types of MRI sequences.  Abnormalities show up differently on these sequences.  Seeing something on T2/FLAIR means there's *some* change in that area \u2013 often related to fluid or inflammation.  It doesn't tell us *what* is causing the change, only that change exists.\n    * **\"On the right\"** Specifies the location.  The finding is present on the right side of your brain.\n\n**Now, the \"Impression\" Section:**\n\n* **\"Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right which may be related to microvascular ischemic change with demyelinating disease not excluded.\"** This is the radiologist\u2019s interpretation of what they saw. It's important to remember this is *not* a diagnosis, but rather a suggestion of possibilities. Let's break it down:\n    * **\"May be related to microvascular ischemic change\"**  The small spots *could* be due to tiny areas of reduced blood flow in the white matter. This is more common as people age, and can be related to things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. You didn\u2019t mention these but they are common associated conditions.\n    * **\"With demyelinating disease not excluded.\"** This means the changes *could also* be related to a demyelinating disease.  \"Demyelination\" refers to damage to the protective coating around nerve fibers (myelin). Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the best-known demyelinating disease, but there are others. The radiologist isn\u2019t saying you *have* MS, only that it\u2019s a possibility that needs to be considered.  They\u2019re being cautious and thorough.  \n\n**What Does This Mean *For You* Specifically?**\n\nGiven your history of temporal lobe epilepsy, and the fact that you've been experiencing increased headaches and migraines, these findings need to be considered in context.\n\n*   **Epilepsy:** White matter abnormalities are sometimes seen in people with epilepsy, especially if the epilepsy has been long-standing. It\u2019s not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the epilepsy itself can sometimes lead to subtle changes in the brain.\n*   **Migraines:** Interestingly, white matter abnormalities are also sometimes seen in people with chronic migraine. The relationship is still being studied, but there may be a link.\n*   **Your Medications:** Your medications (Lamotrigine and Topomax, especially) can sometimes have effects on the brain and it's important to discuss whether they might contribute to these findings with your doctor. Propranolol and Ubrelvy are less likely to be directly related to white matter changes.\n*   **Age:** At 51, some degree of age-related changes in the brain is normal.\n\n\n\n**What Happens Next?**\n\nYour doctor will likely want to:\n\n*   **Correlate with Your Symptoms:** They'll want to know if the headaches and migraines are changing in character or severity, and if you're experiencing any new neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, vision changes, cognitive problems, etc.).\n*   **Review Your Medical History:** Discuss your overall health, including blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and any family history of neurological conditions.\n*   **Consider Further Testing:**  To differentiate between the possible causes, your doctor *might* order:\n    *   **Repeat MRI:** A follow-up MRI in 6-12 months is common to see if the changes remain stable, grow, or new ones appear.\n    *   **Further MRI Sequences:**  Specific MRI sequences can give more information about the nature of the white matter changes.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To look for markers of inflammation or other conditions.\n    *    **Neurological Examination:** A thorough assessment of your reflexes, strength, sensation, coordination, and cognitive function.\n\n\n\n**In summary:** The MRI findings aren\u2019t immediately alarming, but they do require investigation.  The radiologist's impression highlights possibilities, not certainties.  The most important thing is to discuss these results with your doctor, who can interpret them in the context of your overall health and clinical picture.  \n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and **cannot provide medical advice**.

I am not a doctor and cannot diagnose or treat medical conditions.  \n\n**You *must* discuss these MRI results with your neurologist and/or primary care physician.** They are the only ones who can properly evaluate your specific situation, order appropriate follow-up tests, and provide you with accurate medical advice.  Please don't rely on information from the internet (including this response) to make decisions about your health.\n\n\n\nI hope this explanation helps ease some of your anxiety, and I wish you the best in getting clear answers and appropriate care.

This means it makes it *easier* for a seizure to start, even if you haven't had one in a long time.  Even light-triggered epilepsy can be affected.  The risk is generally considered low, but it exists.  Different people respond differently.\n* **Light-Triggered Epilepsy (Photosensitive Epilepsy):**  The fact that your epilepsy is triggered by light is important.  It doesn't necessarily mean diphenhydramine is a definite 'no', but it *increases* the need for caution.  Periods of drowsiness or altered mental state (which diphenhydramine can cause) *might* theoretically make you less aware of and less able to avoid triggering lights.\n* **ADHD:** ADHD and sleep problems frequently go hand-in-hand.  However, diphenhydramine can sometimes *worsen* ADHD symptoms in some people (paradoxical excitation \u2013 it can make you feel more wired instead of sleepy).  This is more common in children, but it can happen in adults.\n* **Anxiety:** Diphenhydramine can sometimes increase anxiety in certain individuals. While it can be sedating, the anticholinergic effects can mimic anxiety symptoms (dry mouth, racing heart, etc.). Also, rebound anxiety (anxiety returning worse when the medication wears off) is a possibility.\n* **Interactions:** Diphenhydramine can interact with alcohol (which you hopefully aren't mixing with sleep aids!), and other medications.  Even over-the-counter medications should be checked for interactions.\n\n\n\n**Specific Concerns Given Your Profile (6'5\", 23M):**\n\n* **Dosage:**  You are a larger individual. Standard Nytol dosages might be less effective, tempting you to take more.  *Never* exceed the recommended dose.  More isn't better, and significantly increases risks.\n* **Metabolism:** Your metabolism could be faster due to your size, meaning the effects might wear off quicker, potentially disrupting sleep further.\n\n\n\n**Why You Need to Talk to a Doctor (and What to Discuss):**\n\n**This is not something you should self-treat.  You *must* discuss this with a healthcare professional.** Here's what to tell them:\n\n1. **Full Medical History:**  Be very clear about your epilepsy (even if it's mild and light-triggered), your ADHD, and your anxiety.  Tell them what triggers your light-induced epilepsy, if known.\n2. **Current Symptoms:**  Describe exactly what's happening with your sleep \u2013 how long it takes to fall asleep, how often you wake up, how you feel during the day.\n3. **Medication List:**  List *everything* you take, including supplements and over-the-counter drugs.\n4. **Nytol Question:** Specifically ask: \"Given my epilepsy, ADHD, and anxiety, is liquid Nytol (diphenhydramine) a safe option for me, even for occasional use? What are the risks and benefits in my specific case?\"\n5. **Alternative Options:**  Ask about alternatives that might be safer and more effective for *you*.  These might include:\n    * **Melatonin:**  Often a good first step, but discuss the appropriate dosage with your doctor.\n    * **Magnesium:**  Some people find magnesium helpful for sleep, but again, check with your doctor.\n    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):**  A highly effective, non-medication approach.\n    * **Prescription Sleep Aids:**  If other options fail, your doctor might consider a prescription sleep aid, but they'll need to choose one carefully considering your epilepsy and other conditions.\n    * **Addressing Anxiety/ADHD:** Sometimes tackling the underlying anxiety or ADHD can improve sleep.\n\n**Things to *Avoid* Without Medical Advice:**\n\n* **Combining Nytol with other sedatives or alcohol.**\n* **Taking more than the recommended dose of Nytol.**\n* **Using Nytol regularly for more than a few days without talking to your doctor.**\n* **Assuming that because it's \"over-the-counter\" it's automatically safe for you.**\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": " 50F in Australia, on carbimazole and levetiracetam for Graves\u2019 and epilepsy, respectively. FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a tricky situation, and it's good you're thinking carefully about whether to go to the ED. Let's break down the factors, and I'll give you a reasoned assessment, keeping in mind I am AI and *cannot* give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you always need to defer to a qualified medical professional.  I will also explain *why* I'm saying things to help you understand the reasoning.\n\n**Here's a summary of your situation:**\n\n* **50F, Australia:** Age is a factor, as bone density and healing capacity decrease with age.\n* **Medications:** Carbimazole (Graves' Disease) and Levetiracetam (Epilepsy).  These aren't *directly* impacting the wrist injury, but it's important for any doctor to know your full medication list.  Levetiracetam can sometimes have neurological side effects, so clarifying whether any of your symptoms are *new* or *different* is important.\n* **Mechanism of Injury:** FOOSH (Fall On Outstretched Hand) \u2013 a common mechanism for wrist fractures.  Running suggests some impact force.\n* **Symptoms:**\n    * **Initial Numbness:** This is common in FOOSH injuries, as it can indicate nerve compression/irritation.  The fact it resolved is good.\n    * **Persistent Pain:** Pain focused around the base of the thumb with radiation down the wrist is concerning.  This points to potential issues with the scaphoid bone, ligaments, or the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of the thumb.\n    * **Pain with Grip & Specific Motion:** The pain with gripping and the toothbrush button pressure is a key finding. It suggests a mechanical problem exacerbated by force.\n    * **Sleep Disturbance:** Indicates a level of discomfort beyond just a minor sprain.\n    * **Road Rash:** Superficial, and less of an immediate concern than the underlying wrist pain.\n* **Access to Imaging:** Radiology closed for the weekend, ED the only option for immediate X-ray.\n\n\n\n**Let's consider the potential injuries and their urgency:**\n\n* **Scaphoid Fracture:** This is a *very* common wrist fracture from a FOOSH. It often presents with pain at the base of the thumb, and can be difficult to see on initial X-rays.  *This is the biggest concern*.  Early diagnosis and immobilization (casting) are crucial, as a missed scaphoid fracture can lead to long-term arthritis and loss of wrist function.\n* **Other Wrist Fractures:**  Fractures of other carpal bones (lunate, triquetrum, etc.) are less common but possible.\n* **Ligament Injuries:**  Ligaments in the wrist can be sprained or torn. These can cause pain and instability, but are generally less urgent than a fracture.\n* **Carpometacarpal (CMC) Joint Injury:** The joint at the base of your thumb can be injured, causing pain with grip.  \n* **Soft Tissue Contusion/Sprain:**  This is the least serious, but still needs to be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Should you wait until Monday or go to the ED?**\n\n**Based on the information you've provided, I lean towards *strongly considering* going to the ED, or at least seeing a doctor ASAP on Monday morning (and arranging for an X-ray then).** Here\u2019s why:\n\n* **Location of the Pain:** Pain concentrated at the base of the thumb is a classic location for a scaphoid fracture.\n* **Pain with Specific Movements:** The pain with gripping and thumb use is highly suggestive of a structural problem (fracture or significant ligament injury).\n* **Mechanism of Injury:** Running provides more force than walking, and a FOOSH is known for causing these types of injuries.\n* **Sleep Disruption:** While not a definitive sign, it suggests the pain is significant enough to warrant investigation.\n* **Delayed Diagnosis Risk:**  As mentioned, a missed scaphoid fracture can have long-term consequences.\n\n**Why wait until Monday is risky:**\n\n* **Fracture Displacement:**  If it is a fracture, continued movement could cause it to displace further, making it more difficult to treat.\n* **Increased Swelling & Pain:** Delaying treatment will likely lead to more swelling and pain.\n\n**What about the medications?**\n\nYour medications are less directly relevant but should be mentioned to the doctor.  It\u2019s good they are aware of everything you take.\n\n\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1.  **ED vs. Urgent Care (if available):**  If there\u2019s even a slight chance you can find an urgent care center open with X-ray capabilities, that would be an excellent option to avoid the potentially long wait at the ED.\n\n2.  **If you decide to wait until Monday:**\n    *   **Call and schedule the *first* appointment available with a doctor.** Emphasize your concern about a wrist injury after a fall, and the location of the pain.\n    *   **Specifically request an X-ray.**\n    *   **Immobilize the wrist:** Wear a wrist brace (if you have one) or splint the wrist with a makeshift splint using cardboard and tape to minimize movement.\n    *   **Ice:** Apply ice to the wrist for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day.\n    *   **Pain Relief:** You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen (if you are able to take it based on other health condtions) to manage the pain, *but do not exceed the recommended dosage*.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I'm an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nTo help me refine my assessment (though I still can't give medical advice!), if you can, could you tell me:\n\n*   **How severe is the pain on a scale of 1-10 (1 being barely noticeable, 10 being the worst pain imaginable)?**\n*   **Is there any bruising developing?**\n*   **Can you move your fingers (all of them) with reasonable range of motion?**\n* **Are you able to take anti-inflammatory medication?**\n\n\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision.  Please prioritize getting your wrist evaluated by a medical professional to ensure a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that is a *very* detailed history! You've clearly done a lot of thinking and tracking of this, which is excellent. It sounds incredibly frustrating to have been dismissed by previous doctors regarding your headaches, and to feel like you've had to troubleshoot this yourself. Let's break down your questions and concerns.  I'll give you a comprehensive response, but **please remember I am an AI and cannot offer medical advice.** This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* discuss this with your neurologist.\n\n**1. Should you throw out the Lamictal XR that expires in August 2022?**\n\nThis is the core question, and it's legitimately a valid concern, given your history.  Here's a nuanced breakdown:\n\n* **Your Neurologist's Theory:** Your neurologist's suggestion that effectiveness *could* diminish even before the official expiration date, particularly if manufactured years prior, isn't entirely outside the realm of possibility.  Drug degradation isn't a cliff-drop on the expiration date; it's a gradual process.  The formulation and storage conditions (which we'll get to) play a role. Your experience *seems* to support this theory, given the correlation between older bottles, lower levels, and increased seizure activity.\n* **Expiration Dates & Stability:**  Pharmaceutical companies guarantee potency up to the expiration date if the medication is stored correctly.  However, studies *have* shown some degradation can occur before that date, especially with sensitive medications.  The 6-month \"grace period\" some professionals mention is based on *some* stability data but isn't a hard rule.\n* **Your Response to Change:** The fact that switching to newer bottles correlated with improved seizure control and stabilized blood levels is significant.  That's a strong piece of evidence in favor of your neurologist\u2019s suspicion that the older bottles *were* less potent for *you*.\n* **Your Current Situation:** You're experiencing the return of morning headaches, which you previously linked to lower Lamictal levels. The fact that they coincide with potential medication degradation is concerning.\n* **Recommendation:**  *Given your history, it's reasonable, and likely prudent, to discard the bottles expiring in August 2022 and start using the June 2023 bottles.*  It\u2019s a small investment to potentially improve your seizure control and quality of life.  Don\u2019t feel guilty about not \"finishing\" them to save money, especially given the risks.\n\n\n\n**2. XR Formulation and Dosage Change (200mg x 3 vs. 300mg x 2)**\n\nYou're right to be thoughtful about this!  This is a good question.\n\n* **XR Formulation Considerations:** XR (extended-release) formulations are designed to release the medication slowly over time. While both the 200mg and 300mg XR tablets release lamotrigine similarly *in principle*, there *could* be slight differences in the release profile due to the different tablet weights and coatings.\n* **Potential Impact on Blood Levels:**  It's **unlikely** this dosage change will cause a *significant* change in your *average* blood levels, *assuming* the total daily dose (600mg) remains the same. However, it's *possible* you might notice a slight shift in peak versus trough concentrations.  The entire point of XR is to minimize peaks and troughs, so this is usually not a problem.\n* **Headaches and XR Timing:** Your headaches occurring in the morning *could* be related to slightly lower lamotrigine levels overnight. Switching to the 300mg XR might provide a more sustained release, potentially reducing that morning dip. However, it's equally possible the headaches are stress-related as you suspect.\n* **Recommendation:**  *Switching to the 300mg XR is unlikely to cause harm*.  Since your total daily dose isn\u2019t changing, it is reasonable to try it. Monitor your headaches and seizure frequency after the switch for a couple of weeks. *Don\u2019t* switch back and forth between the formulations; give it enough time to stabilize.\n\n\n\n**3.  Factors impacting Lamictal levels & your situation**\n\n*   **Storage**: You mentioned storing the meds in your dresser. While convenient, this can expose them to temperature fluctuations and humidity, which *can* accelerate degradation. Ideally, medications should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight\u2014a bathroom cabinet might be better, but not right next to the shower, as humidity can be a factor there too.\n*   **Stress and Sleep**: You\u2019ve rightly identified these as triggers for you. Stress and sleep deprivation are well-known to increase seizure risk. Managing these effectively is just as important as medication adherence.\n*   **Blood Level Checks:**  You haven't had levels checked recently. This is important, even though you felt better on 600mg. Blood levels can fluctuate, and a check will provide a baseline. But as you said, it\u2019s not possible to do so right now.\n\n\n\n**What to discuss with your neurologist:**\n\nWhen you speak with your neurologist this week, be prepared to discuss:\n\n*   **Your concerns about the expiration dates and the correlation with your symptoms.** Specifically, describe how your condition improved when you switched bottles.\n*   **The recent return of your headaches.**\n*   **Your hesitation about changing the XR formulation**, but also your understanding of how the release mechanism works.\n*  **Your life stress and disrupted sleep** \u2013 emphasize how these factors impact your seizures.\n*   **Ask about the possibility of proactively discarding the bottles expiring in August 2022.** Don't worry about seeming \"wasteful\"; prioritize your health.\n* **When you can get your levels checked**, and whether this is something you should prioritize.\n\n**In summary:** You\u2019ve been a very good patient! You\u2019ve paid close attention to your body and your medication. You\u2019ve observed patterns, and you\u2019re asking intelligent questions. Trust your intuition, and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself with your doctor. It's reasonable to err on the side of caution and switch to the newer medication, especially given your history and symptoms.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nYou are absolutely right to feel uneasy and to question this explanation. Your instincts are good. While neonatal seizures *can* happen, the explanation given by the neurologist sounds\u2026highly improbable, and frankly, dismissive given the situation. It's wonderful that your friend has you to advocate for them and their family. Here's a breakdown of why your skepticism is justified, and what this *could* be, along with information for your friend.  I will add a **disclaimer at the end** as I am not a medical professional and cannot provide medical advice.\n\n**Why the Neurologist's Explanation is Problematic:**\n\n* **Timing:**  The explanation of \"shaking during delivery\" causing seizures *three days later* is incredibly weak.  While stress during delivery can certainly affect a baby, the effect wouldn't be delayed like that. The mechanism just doesn\u2019t make sense medically. A stress-related tremor in the mother doesn\u2019t translate into delayed seizures in the baby.\n* **Recurrence:** One isolated seizure *might* be considered benign, but *three* seizures in 24 hours, and a fourth witnessed by a doctor are highly concerning.  The fact they are *increasing* in severity makes the \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d narrative even more alarming. \n* **Dismissiveness:** A seasoned neurologist should be explaining *what they are ruling out* with the tests, and what course of action they are taking to *investigate* further, not simply dismissing the events.\n* **\"Happens all the time\" is Vague:** While neonatal seizures aren\u2019t *rare*, saying it \u201chappens all the time\u201d is unhelpful and downplays the seriousness.  It doesn't give the family any information or reassurance.\n\n\n\n**What Could Be Going On (Possibilities - *not* a diagnosis, just things to discuss with doctors):**\n\nThere are *many* potential causes of neonatal seizures.  While the brain scan and reflexes being good is positive, it doesn\u2019t rule everything out. Here are some possibilities:\n\n* **Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar):** Very common in newborns, especially those born post-term (like this baby). It *can* cause seizures. Monitoring blood sugar is crucial.  Post-term babies are more prone to this.\n* **Hypocalcemia (Low Calcium):**  Another common electrolyte imbalance in newborns that can cause seizures.\n* **Infections:**  While often apparent, sometimes subtle infections can cause seizures.  This might require a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to rule out meningitis.\n* **Genetic Metabolic Disorders:**  These are rare, but can present with seizures.  Blood tests can screen for many of these.  It's good that tests are being done, but it's important to ask *which* tests.\n* **Hypoxia-Ischemia (Lack of Oxygen):**  Even though the pregnancy was healthy, there could have been a brief period of oxygen deprivation during labor and delivery.\n* **Subtle Brain Injury:**  Sometimes, scans can miss very small areas of brain injury, especially in the early days.\n* **Drug Withdrawal:** (Unlikely given the stated family history, but it needs to be considered)\n\n\n\n**What Your Friend Should Do (Advocate!):**\n\n* **Second Opinion:** This is *critical*. Your friend needs to demand a second opinion from a different neonatologist, ideally at a different hospital if possible.  Be polite but firm.\n* **Specific Questions:**  Your friend should write down a list of specific questions for the doctors:\n    * \"What specific tests have been done to rule out hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia?\"\n    * \"What tests have been done to rule out infection (including meningitis)?\"\n    * \"What genetic metabolic tests are being performed?\"\n    * \"What is the plan if the seizures continue or worsen?\"\n    * \"What are the potential long-term consequences of neonatal seizures, even with a normal brain scan?\"\n    * \"Can we see the detailed results of the brain scan, and have them explained to us?\"\n    * \"Why did you feel it was appropriate to discharge the baby after the initial seizure in the hospital?\"\n* **Document Everything:** Keep a log of all seizures \u2013 time, duration, what the baby was doing before, and what happened afterward.\n* **Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Push Back:** It's okay to say, \"I\u2019m not comfortable with this explanation. I feel we need more investigation.\"\n* **Trust Your Gut:**  You and your friend are right to feel something isn\u2019t adding up.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding your concern about a lawsuit:** While it's possible the hospital is trying to minimize risk, that shouldn\u2019t be your friend\u2019s primary concern right now. The *baby's health* is paramount. However, it's important to be aware that medical malpractice isn\u2019t necessarily the first thing to consider. Getting a proper diagnosis and treatment is key, and that may naturally lead to understanding if errors were made.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nYou are a truly good friend for being concerned and supporting your friend.  Encourage her to be her own advocate and to seek further medical attention and a second opinion.  \n\n\n\n"

I'll cover a lot here, so it's a longer response, but important to be thorough. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms:**\n\n* **Depersonalization/Derealization (DPDR):**  This is where you feel detached from yourself (depersonalization) or from reality (derealization).  It can feel like you're watching yourself from outside your body, or that the world isn't real.  This is often associated with anxiety, stress, and trauma, but can also have other causes.\n* **Confusion:**  This can manifest in various ways - difficulty thinking clearly, feeling foggy, trouble remembering things, or feeling disoriented.  Combined with DPDR, it paints a picture of altered states of consciousness.\n* **Your Age and Build:** Being 18 and fairly slim (62kg at 180cm is a BMI of around 21.6, which is within the normal range but potentially on the lower side) is relevant as it influences some risk factors.\n\n\n\n**Can Epilepsy (Specifically Non-Convulsive Seizures) Cause DPDR and Confusion? Yes, Absolutely.**\n\nThis is where your thinking is correct and why it's important to explore further.  Here's how:\n\n* **Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE):** This is a prolonged state of seizure activity *without* the obvious, dramatic convulsions most people associate with epilepsy.  It can be subtle and easily missed.  The brain is still having abnormal electrical activity, but it doesn\u2019t manifest as shaking or jerking.\n* **Focal Seizures & Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:**  Certain types of seizures, particularly focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe (involved in memory, emotion, and perception) can manifest with symptoms very similar to DPDR and confusion. These areas are deeply involved in your sense of self and reality.  Temporal lobe seizures can cause:\n    * **Subjective experiences:** Feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, jamais vu (feeling something familiar is completely new), strange smells or tastes, emotional changes (fear, anxiety, euphoria), and *depersonalization/derealization*.\n    * **Cognitive difficulties:** Confusion, memory problems, difficulty with language.\n* **Subclinical Seizures:** These are seizures that happen *without* outward signs. They can still disrupt brain function and cause subtle changes in perception and cognition, potentially leading to DPDR and confusion.\n\n\n\n**Why Your MRI Was Normal (But Doesn't Rule Out Epilepsy):**\n\n* **MRI Sensitivity:**  MRI is excellent at identifying structural abnormalities in the brain (tumors, strokes, significant damage). However, it's *not* always good at detecting the *electrical* problems that cause seizures, especially if there\u2019s no visible structural damage. About 60% of people with temporal lobe epilepsy have a normal MRI.\n* **Anatomical Variants:**  \"Normal anatomical variants\" mean you have slight differences in brain structure that are common and generally don't cause problems. They're not related to your symptoms.\n* **Seizures are an Electrical Problem:** Epilepsy is primarily a disorder of *brain electrical activity,* not necessarily brain structure.\n\n\n\n\n**What Should Happen Next (Given Your Situation):**\n\n\n\n\n1. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** *This is the crucial next step.* An EEG measures electrical activity in your brain using electrodes placed on your scalp. It's the primary test for diagnosing epilepsy.\n    * **Routine EEG:**  A standard EEG can sometimes miss seizures, especially if they are infrequent.\n    * **Prolonged EEG (24-72 hour):**  This is *much* more valuable, as it increases the chances of capturing seizure activity. You\u2019ll likely be asked to try to provoke a seizure during this, by sleep deprivation or flashing lights.\n    * **Video-EEG Monitoring:**  Considered the gold standard.  You are monitored with EEG *and* video recording for a longer period (often several days) in a hospital setting. This allows doctors to correlate any observed changes in your brain activity with your symptoms.  This is especially important if your symptoms are intermittent.\n2. **Detailed Neurological Exam:**  The neurologist should perform a thorough neurological exam to look for subtle signs that might suggest seizures (e.g., brief lapses in attention, unusual movements you might not notice).\n3. **Review of Medical History:**  The neurologist needs a very detailed history, including:\n    * **Onset and Evolution of Symptoms:** When did the DPDR and confusion start?  Have they gotten worse?  Are they constant, or do they come and go?\n    * **Triggers:**  Are there any things that seem to make your symptoms worse (stress, sleep deprivation, flashing lights, certain sounds)?\n    * **Family History:**  Is there a family history of epilepsy or similar neurological conditions?\n    * **Medications:**  List all medications you take, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n4. **Consider Psychiatric Evaluation:**  It\u2019s important to rule out other causes of DPDR, such as anxiety, depression, or trauma. A psychiatric evaluation can help with this as well, and it doesn't mean the neurologist thinks it *isn't* epilepsy.  Often, these conditions can coexist.\n5. **Trial of Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):**  *This is sometimes done as a diagnostic test.* If the EEG is inconclusive, but the neurologist strongly suspects epilepsy, they may suggest a trial of AEDs. If your symptoms improve on the medication, it supports the diagnosis.  *This should be done under very close medical supervision.*\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Don't Self-Diagnose:**  It's easy to fall down the internet rabbit hole and convince yourself you have a specific condition. Let the doctors do their job.\n* **Be Persistent:** If you feel like your concerns aren't being taken seriously, or if your symptoms aren't improving, don\u2019t hesitate to seek a second opinion.\n* **Keep a Symptom Diary:**  Record when your symptoms occur, what they feel like, how long they last, and any potential triggers. This information is invaluable for your doctor.\n\n\n\n**In your case, given your symptoms and a normal MRI, pushing for a prolonged EEG (and potentially video-EEG monitoring) is the most important next step.**  \n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very complex case with a lot of overlapping and concerning symptoms. It points to a systemic process, but pinpointing it is challenging. Here's a breakdown of potential considerations, grouped by how they relate to the presented symptoms, along with further investigation ideas. **Please read the disclaimer at the end.  This is NOT a diagnosis, but a reasoned approach to the presented information.**\n\n**I. Key Symptom Clusters & Initial Thoughts**\n\n*   **Neurological (Seizures, Stroke-like Symptoms, Aphasia, Dysphagia, Visual Disturbances, Neuropathy):**  This is a central theme. The combination of seizures and what sounds like a stroke-like event at onset is very concerning.  The visual changes (black lines) need further investigation.\n*   **Hematological (Anemia, Thrombosis, Bruising):**  The combination of anemia, clotting issues, and bruising is *highly* significant. It suggests a disrupted balance in the blood's components, but doesn't clearly point to one disease.\n*   **Renal (GFR Swings):** Fluctuating GFR is not typical and requires aggressive investigation. It suggests something is causing intermittent kidney *injury* rather than a chronic, stable issue.\n*   **Autoimmune/Inflammatory (Positive ANA, Raynaud's, Joint Pain):** The positive ANA (rising titer) and Raynaud's are suggestive of an autoimmune process, but the negative Rheumatoid Factor makes RA less likely.\n*   **Cardiovascular (Tachycardia, PVCs):**  These could be secondary to anemia, electrolyte imbalances, or the underlying inflammatory/autoimmune process.\n*   **Metabolic (Low Glucose Issues):** The reported difficulty with low glucose deserves further exploration despite negative diabetes tests.\n\n\n\n**II.  Differential Diagnoses \u2013 Re-Evaluating & Expanding**\n\nHere's a more detailed look at potential diagnoses, keeping in mind the negative tests so far and the complex symptom picture.  I'll categorize them by probability/priority, but all require consideration.\n\n**A. Higher Probability / Need Urgent Re-evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** *Despite* the initial stable C3/C4, lupus should be *retested thoroughly*.  Lupus can have fluctuating C3/C4 levels and can present atypically.\n    *   **Why it fits:** Positive ANA (rising titer), Renal involvement (GFR swings \u2013 lupus nephritis!), Thrombosis/bruising (antiphospholipid syndrome is very common in lupus), neurological symptoms (seizures, stroke-like symptoms, aphasia, neuropathy, visual disturbances), possible joint pain.\n    *   **Testing:** Repeat C3, C4, anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-Smith antibody, antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2 glycoprotein I),  consider a kidney biopsy if GFR continues to decline or protein is in the urine.\n2.  **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):**  Often linked to Lupus, but can occur independently. This is a *strong* consideration given the clots and neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Why it fits:**  Thrombosis (blood clots/bruising), neurological symptoms (stroke-like event, seizures, aphasia), and can cause kidney issues\n    *   **Testing:** Specific APS antibody panel (as mentioned above with Lupus).\n3.   **Vasculitis (Small Vessel Vasculitis):** Inflammation of blood vessels.  The fluctuating GFR, neuropathy, skin findings (bruising) and potential clots could fit.\n    *   **Why it fits:** Can affect multiple organs, leading to a wide range of symptoms.\n    *   **Testing:** ESR, CRP, Complement levels, ANCA (Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies) panel, consider a biopsy of an affected tissue (skin, kidney).\n\n**B.  Intermediate Probability \u2013 Need Investigation:**\n\n4.  **Mitochondrial Disease:** Can present with seizures, neurological symptoms, muscle weakness, and anemia. It can affect multiple organ systems.  Family history is less important, as mitochondrial mutations can occur spontaneously.\n    *   **Why it fits:** Neurological issues, fatigue, potential for multiple organ involvement.\n    *   **Testing:**  Lactate/Pyruvate levels, muscle biopsy, genetic testing.\n5.  **Uremic Encephalopathy:**  While she doesn\u2019t have end-stage renal disease, fluctuating GFR *can* lead to build-up of toxins affecting the brain. This could contribute to the seizures, neurological symptoms, and cognitive issues. \n    *   **Why it fits:** GFR fluctuations and neurological symptoms.\n6.  **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** Rare, but possible.  Sometimes cancer can trigger an immune response that affects the nervous system or other organs.  Given the complex presentation, consider screening.\n    *   **Why it fits:** Wide range of symptoms, including neurological and hematological.\n    *   **Testing:** Age-appropriate cancer screening, assess for any subtle signs of malignancy.\n7. **Genetic Thrombophilia:** A predisposition to blood clots.  Could explain the clotting issues, especially if combined with another underlying condition.\n    * **Why it Fits:** Blood clots and bruising\n    * **Testing:** Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin gene mutation, Protein C and S deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency\n\n**C. Lower Probability, But Consider:**\n\n8.  **Other Autoimmune Disorders:**  While Sj\u00f6gren's was negative, other rarer autoimmune conditions should be considered.\n9.  **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP):** Can cause neuropathy and may sometimes be misdiagnosed as MS.\n10. **Complex Migraine Variants** - Some migraine variants can have aura that includes neurological deficits, and there can be association with blood clotting abnormalities\n\n\n\n**III.  Further Investigations - Non-Negotiable**\n\n*   **Repeat Renal Function Panel:** Monitor GFR, creatinine, electrolytes *frequently* (every 2-4 weeks).  Also check for protein in the urine (urine protein/creatinine ratio).\n*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential & Peripheral Smear:**  Detailed examination of blood cells.\n*   **Iron Studies:**  Full iron panel to assess the anemia more thoroughly.\n*   **Coagulation Studies:**  PT, PTT, D-dimer, fibrinogen.\n*   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** To assess overall metabolic function, including glucose, liver function, and electrolytes.\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG) / Holter Monitor:** To evaluate the tachycardia and PVCs.\n*   **Neuroimaging:** Consider *repeat* MRI of the brain (with and without contrast), and potentially MR angiography to assess blood vessels.\n*    **Opthalmologic Exam:** Due to visual changes\n*   **Neurology Consultation:** If not already involved, a neurologist specializing in epilepsy and stroke is critical.\n\n**IV.  Regarding Glucose**\n\n*   **Hemoglobin A1c:**  A better measure of long-term glucose control than a single fasting glucose.\n*   **Continuous Glucose Monitoring:**  In case there are post-prandial (after-meal) dips in glucose that aren't captured by standard testing.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **The TBI history:**  Could be contributing to some symptoms, but doesn't explain the new onset of clots, the fluctuating kidney function, and the positive ANA.\n*   **Postpartum Hemorrhage:** Significant bleedings can trigger autoimmune responses in some individuals.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and you're right to be proactive and seek information. It's good you're already heading towards psychological support \u2013 that's a very important step. Here's a breakdown of possible reasons for the change in seizure control, things to consider, and suggestions for managing this, broken down into sections.  I'll cover medical, psychological, practical aspects, and things to discuss with doctors.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end; this is not medical advice.**\n\n**I. Why the Change in Seizure Control? - Exploring Possible Causes**\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to the increased frequency of absent seizures after her return from India, even with seemingly stable medication.  It's rarely just *one* thing.\n\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**  This is what the doctors suspect, and it's very plausible given the correlation with stress/anxiety and the lip smacking/chewing (automatisms) which are common in PNES.  PNES aren't \"fake\" seizures; they are *real* events caused by the brain responding to psychological distress. They can look very similar to epileptic seizures, making diagnosis tricky.  However, they don\u2019t respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). \n* **Malabsorption/Medication Levels:** Travel can disrupt routines and dietary habits.  It's possible:\n    * **Dietary Changes in India:** Significant changes in diet could impact how her body absorbs the medications. Different foods can influence medication metabolism.\n    * **Consistency of Medication While Traveling:** Was she able to consistently take her medication exactly as prescribed during her time in India?  Lost doses, variations in generic brands, or even storage conditions could have played a role. A blood test to check current Trileptal and Keppra levels may be useful.\n* **Stress and Anxiety:**  You rightly identified this as a major potential factor.  Re-entry into a different culture after a long period away can be profoundly stressful, even if she has lived in Australia for a long time. Loneliness, feeling disconnected from family, and adjusting back to daily life can all contribute.  The anticipation of returning *can* also cause stress.\n* **Underlying Epilepsy Change:**  While less likely, it's possible her epilepsy itself has subtly changed.  Epilepsy can evolve over time. The seizure \"type\" might be shifting, or she might need a medication adjustment.\n* **Sleep Disruption:** Travel disrupts sleep patterns. Poor sleep is a known seizure trigger for many people with epilepsy.\n* **Environmental Factors:** Different water, climate, or even altitude in India might have had a subtle impact.\n\n\n\n**II.  Medical Investigations and Specialist Considerations**\n\n* **Neurologist Review (Crucial):**  She *needs* a thorough review with her neurologist.  Specifically ask about:\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** A recent EEG, *especially* one recorded *during* or immediately after a seizure, is essential. This helps differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic seizures.  A prolonged EEG monitoring (24-72 hours) may be necessary to capture an event. Video EEG monitoring is the gold standard.\n    * **Medication Level Monitoring:**  Blood tests to check Keppra and Trileptal levels to ensure they are within the therapeutic range.\n    * **Differential Diagnosis:**  A discussion about other, rarer causes of seizures should be had.\n    * **Consideration of Medication Adjustment:**  Discuss whether adjustments to her current medications are warranted, even if PNES is suspected. Sometimes, despite the psychological component, continuing some AEDs can provide a baseline level of control.\n* **Second Opinion (Consider):** If you're not entirely satisfied with the current neurologist's approach, a second opinion from a different epilepsy specialist is a good idea.  Look for a neurologist who specialises in *difficult-to-control epilepsy*.\n* **Psychiatrist (Potentially):**  A psychiatrist, particularly one with experience in epilepsy and comorbidity, *may* be helpful. They can assess for underlying mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders) and prescribe medication if needed, alongside the psychologist.\n\n**III. Psychological Support & Therapy**\n\nYou're already on the right track with the psychologist. Here's what to look for in therapy:\n\n* **Therapy Type:**\n    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Highly effective for managing anxiety and understanding the link between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Can help develop coping mechanisms for stress.\n    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based actions.\n    * **Trauma-Informed Therapy:** If there's a history of trauma (even subtle, like emotional isolation), this approach can be beneficial.\n* **Focus of Therapy:**\n    * **Stress Management:**  Learning relaxation techniques (deep breathing, mindfulness, meditation).\n    * **Anxiety Reduction:**  Strategies to identify and challenge anxious thoughts.\n    * **Coping with Isolation:**  Addressing feelings of loneliness and finding ways to connect with others.\n    * **Developing a Support Network:** Building a stronger sense of community.\n    * **Understanding PNES (if diagnosed):**  If PNES is confirmed, therapy can help understand the trigger and develop coping mechanisms.\n\n**IV.  Practical Safety Measures & Lifestyle Adjustments**\n\n* **Home Safety:**\n    * **Remove Hazards:**  Minimize sharp objects or things she could bump into during a seizure.\n    * **Soft Flooring:**  Consider rugs or carpet in areas where she spends a lot of time.\n    * **Inform Household Members:**  Everyone in the household should know what to do if a seizure occurs (stay calm, protect her head, don\u2019t restrain her, time the seizure, call emergency services if it lasts longer than a few minutes or if she has repeated seizures).\n* **Daily Routine:**\n    * **Consistent Sleep:** Establish a regular sleep schedule.\n    * **Healthy Diet:** Maintain a balanced diet.\n    * **Regular Exercise (as tolerated):**  Physical activity can reduce stress and improve mood.\n* **Social Connection:**\n    * **Encourage Contact with Family:**  Regular video calls or phone calls with family overseas.\n    * **Local Support Groups:**  Look for epilepsy support groups or other community groups in her area.\n    * **Hobbies & Interests:**  Encourage her to engage in activities she enjoys.\n\n**V.  Questions to Ask the Doctors**\n\n* \"What is the likelihood that these seizures are psychogenic, and what further testing can be done to confirm or rule that out?\"\n* \"What are the current Trileptal and Keppra levels, and are they within the therapeutic range?\"\n* \"Are there any potential interactions between her epilepsy medications and her blood pressure/cholesterol medications?\"\n* \"Would a medication adjustment be appropriate, even if PNES is suspected?\"\n* \"Can we discuss the possibility of referral to a psychiatrist?\"\n* \"What are the specific seizure triggers for my mother, and how can we minimize them?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing. Could that be something that is going on? I was just curious! This doesn\u2019t really negatively impact my life, it just causes me to get some weird looks sometimes.Details: 23F, 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs, Caucasian, acid cravings, existing medical issues (Migraines, IST, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation), medications (verapamil and singulair), no drugs, sparingly drink, no smoking.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *really* interesting and specific craving pattern. You're right to be curious and explore potential underlying causes. It's great you're self-aware and are already thinking about potential biological connections. Let's break down what could be happening, given your detailed information, and what you might want to discuss with your doctor.\n\n**1. Pica and Atypical Cravings: Is this Pica?**\n\nWhat you're describing falls into the realm of *pica* \u2013 the persistent craving for non-nutritive substances. However, it's important to understand pica isn\u2019t just about eating dirt or clay. It also encompasses strong cravings for things like ice, starch, and, importantly, *acidic foods*. The defining factor is the craving is persistent, not just a passing preference. Your lifelong, recurring pattern is suggestive of this.  While not *always* harmful, pica can be a sign of an underlying issue.\n\n**2. Potential Nutritional Deficiencies \u2013 The Most Likely Avenue**\n\nYou're absolutely correct to think about nutrient deficiencies. Here's a breakdown of possibilities, linked to *why* vinegar/acid might be attractive:\n\n*   **Iron Deficiency:** This is *the* most common association with pica.  While your bloodwork doesn't mention iron levels specifically, sometimes iron deficiency is subtle and can exist even *with* normal hemoglobin. The mechanism isn't fully understood, but one theory suggests the acidity may improve iron absorption (though consuming large quantities of vinegar isn't a healthy way to boost iron, unfortunately!).  Low white blood cell count can *sometimes* be linked to iron deficiency, but it's not a direct one-to-one.\n*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Similar to iron, zinc is crucial for taste and smell, and deficiencies can lead to altered cravings. Zinc also plays a role in immune function, which may relate to your low white blood cell count.\n*   **Calcium Deficiency:** Although less common with acidic cravings, it shouldn't be ruled out.\n*   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Acidic foods can influence electrolyte balance.  Could there be a subtle imbalance driving the craving?\n*   **Vitamin C:** While you get vitamin C from tomatoes and lemons, it is worth considering.\n\n**3. The Gut Microbiome Connection**\n\nThis is a growing area of research.  Your gut bacteria influence cravings. It's possible your microbiome is slightly imbalanced and is \"requesting\" things that provide an acidic environment or precursors to compounds it needs. This is highly speculative, but increasingly plausible.\n\n**4. Medical Conditions/Medications \u2013 Connecting the Dots**\n\n*   **Migraines:**  There's a complex relationship between diet, gut health, and migraines.  Cravings can sometimes be part of a migraine prodrome (early warning signs).\n*   **IST and Heart Valve Issues:** These are less directly linked to cravings, but it's good to have a full picture. Your heart condition and the medication you are on may play a role in absorption.\n*   **Verapamil:** This medication (a calcium channel blocker) *can* potentially affect nutrient absorption, including zinc and iron.  It\u2019s worth mentioning to your doctor if you've started verapamil around the time cravings flared up.\n*   **Singulair (Montelukast):** While less common, some reports link Singulair to changes in taste perception in some individuals.\n\n**5. The Alcohol Connection**\n\nYou've noted the cravings appearing a couple of days post-alcohol consumption. Alcohol can deplete certain nutrients (like B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc) and disrupt gut health, potentially triggering a craving response as your body tries to rebalance. This also supports nutritional deficiency as a potential cause.\n\n**What to Do \u2013 Very Important Steps**\n\n1.  **Detailed Doctor's Visit:** *This is the most important step*.  Specifically, you need to:\n    *   **Explain the craving pattern in detail:**  Lifelong, recurring, specific types of vinegar, quantities, etc. Document these cravings - when they occur and how much you consume.\n    *   **Request Comprehensive Bloodwork:** Absolutely push for:\n        *   **Complete Iron Studies:**  Including serum iron, ferritin (storage iron), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and iron saturation.  Ferritin is key.\n        *   **Zinc Level:** \n        *   **Vitamin D Level:**\n        *   **Magnesium Level:**\n        *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential:**  To further evaluate your low white blood cell count \u2013 could it be an iron connection or something else?\n        *   **Electrolyte Panel:**\n        *   **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels**\n    *   **Medication Review:** Discuss verapamil and Singulair with your doctor, and if there could be any impact on nutrient absorption.\n2.  **Keep a Food Diary:** For a week or two, meticulously record everything you eat *and* when you experience cravings.  This helps identify potential patterns.\n3.  **Consider a Registered Dietitian (RD):**  An RD can help you analyze your diet to identify potential gaps, and suggest strategies to address them through food.\n4.  **Don't Self-Treat with Supplements:**  Too much of certain nutrients can be harmful.

        "question": " I\u2019m 19F about 5\u20193\u201d not sure about my weight but quite small from the UK.So, in the past, I\u2019ve had what I believe to be 3 tonic-clonic seizures. I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don\u2019t feel quite normal at the moment and I\u2019m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it\u2019s my first ever post on Reddit and I\u2019m just very confused about what\u2019s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow, that's a lot to process! You're right to be confused, and it's *very* good you're finally reaching out and trying to understand what's happening. You've had these experiences for a while, and the recent one combined with the history is definitely something that needs looking into. Here's a breakdown of thoughts, advice, and why getting medical attention is crucial.  I'm going to be thorough, and then *strongly* emphasize the need to see a doctor.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**\n\n**Let's break down what you've described:**\n\n* **Past History (Tonic-Clonic Seizures):** Having three events that you believe were tonic-clonic seizures, even years ago, is significant.  The fact that two were linked to cannabis use doesn't necessarily mean the cannabis *caused* them; it could have been a trigger in someone already predisposed to seizures.  The nose piercing incident *could* be related to vasovagal syncope (fainting due to a nerve response, often triggered by pain or stress), but it's also possible it was a seizure.  The lack of diagnosis makes it hard to know definitively.\n* **Recent Episode:** The sudden panic, heat, dizziness, shakiness, and feeling disconnected *strongly* suggests some kind of neurological event.  Your intuition about a focal seizure is worth exploring. Focal seizures can manifest in many ways, and feeling \"disconnected\" is a common description.  They don't always involve convulsions.\n* **Post-Ictal Behavior (Rocking, Staring):** The behavior *after* the initial feeling of a seizure is important.  Staring, rocking, and feeling generally 'off' for a period afterward (what's called the post-ictal phase) *is* consistent with seizure activity. The length of this phase can vary.\n* **Mental Health:** You accurately recognize the overlap between neurological and mental health symptoms. Anxiety and panic *can* cause physical symptoms like dizziness and shaking, but the history of possible seizures changes the picture.  It's important *not* to dismiss this as *just* anxiety, especially given the past events.  While depression and anxiety can sometimes cause dissociative feelings, the sudden onset and context of the events suggests something else is going on.  Your concern about schizophrenia is understandable, but the symptoms you describe are more commonly associated with seizure disorders.\n* **Age of Onset:**  While epilepsy can develop at any age, the late teens/early twenties can be a time when epilepsy can emerge.\n\n**Possible Explanations (with caveats \u2013 *a doctor needs to determine this!*):**\n\n* **Epilepsy:** This is the most important thing to rule out.  Epilepsy isn't always obvious.  Some people have infrequent seizures, and the type can vary.\n* **Post-Traumatic Epilepsy:** If the nose piercing *was* a seizure trigger, it\u2019s possible there was some underlying neurological vulnerability that was revealed.\n* **Febrile Seizures (less likely now):** Though you mentioned it happened on a hot day, it\u2019s less likely if you\u2019ve had multiple events.\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**  These *look* like seizures, but are caused by psychological distress. They are a real condition and can be very frightening.  However, it's *crucial* to rule out epilepsy first before considering this. PNES are often associated with a history of trauma or significant psychological stress.\n* **Trigger-Induced Seizures:** Some people have seizures triggered by specific events (like stress, flashing lights, or, in your case, potentially cannabis). These occurrences don\u2019t necessarily mean you have epilepsy but can be a sign of underlying susceptibility.\n\n\n\n**What You NEED to Do (and this is the most important part):**\n\n1. **See a Doctor - ASAP:** Please, please schedule an appointment with a General Practitioner (GP) as soon as possible.  Be honest with them about *everything* \u2013 the past events, the recent one, your concerns about seizures, your mental health, and your past substance use. Don\u2019t minimize anything because you\u2019re embarrassed or worried about how your parents will react.  Your health is the priority.\n2. **Be Specific:** When describing the events to the doctor, try to be as detailed as possible.  What did you feel *before* the episode?  What exactly happened during? What was the post-ictal phase like?  How long did it last?  It can be helpful to write this down beforehand.\n3. **Request a Referral to a Neurologist:** Your GP will likely recommend a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nervous system disorders.  They can perform tests to determine if you have epilepsy or another neurological condition.\n4. **Tests the Neurologist Might Order:**\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This test measures brain activity. It's often the first step in diagnosing epilepsy.\n    * **MRI of the Brain:** This provides detailed images of your brain and can help identify any structural abnormalities.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out other potential causes of seizures.\n5. **Don\u2019t Drive:**  Until you have a diagnosis and a doctor tells you it's safe, *do not drive*.  Seizures can impair your ability to drive safely and are legally restricted.\n6. **Tell Someone You Trust:** Confide in someone you trust (a friend, family member, or significant other) about what's going on. Having support is crucial.\n7. **Avoid Potential Triggers:** While you\u2019re waiting for a diagnosis, it\u2019s wise to abstain from cannabis (since you\u2019ve noted it as a possible trigger) and avoid potentially stressful situations if possible.\n\n\n**Regarding your mental health:**  Continue to manage your depression and anxiety as you normally would.  But *addressing the potential neurological issue will also likely have a positive impact on your mental wellbeing*. Uncertainty is incredibly stressful, and getting answers will help.\n\n**You are being incredibly proactive by reaching out. It takes courage to talk about this, and you're doing the right thing by seeking information.  Please prioritize seeing a doctor.  This isn\u2019t something you should try to figure out on your own.**\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI Chatbot and *not* a medical professional.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-diagnosis is dangerous.

The lump happened to appear after the injury. It wasn\u2019t super painful so I kept on skating after a few more incidents to the same area I decided to take a break. I\u2019m about a week removed from skating and haven\u2019t seen a noticeable improvement. No pain. Just sensitive to the touch. Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, thanks for providing this information. It's good you're being observant and seeking information, even if you're initially not overly concerned. Here's a breakdown of what this *could* be, what you should consider given your medical history, and what I recommend you do.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for a medical professional's evaluation.**\n\n**Possible Causes (Given your description):**\n\n* **Hematoma:** This is the most likely scenario, especially given the history of repeated trauma. A hematoma is a collection of blood outside the blood vessels, forming a lump.  Skateboarding impacts can easily cause bruising and bleeding under the skin, even without a broken bone.  The fact that it appeared after the injury and isn't improving within 3 weeks is notable, though. The medial side of the tibia is a common spot for these.\n* **Bone Bruise (Bone Contusion):** This involves bleeding *within* the bone. Can also be caused by impact.  Similar to a hematoma, it can take weeks to resolve.  It might be more sensitive than a typical bruise and can sometimes feel like a lump.\n* **Soft Tissue Swelling:** Inflammation of the surrounding tendons, ligaments or muscle.  Repetitive trauma can lead to this.\n* **Periosteal Irritation/Elevated Periosteum:** The periosteum is the membrane covering the bone.  Repeated injury can irritate it, causing inflammation and a bump. Sometimes, if significant enough, it can lift slightly off the bone (periosteal elevation), but this is often more painful.\n* **Less Likely - Stress Fracture:**  While you describe the impact as direct, repetitive stress *can* contribute to stress fractures over time. However, the lack of significant pain makes this less likely as a primary diagnosis.\n* **Less Likely - Cyst/Benign Growth:**  While less common to appear *immediately* after an injury, it's always a possibility that you've simply noticed something that was present before but unnoticed or has grown coincidentally.\n\n**Why Your Epilepsy and Keppra are Relevant:**\n\nThis is *important*.  Keppra (levetiracetam), as an anti-epileptic drug, can sometimes rarely affect bone metabolism.  There's research suggesting a possible association between long-term use and decreased bone density (leading to osteoporosis or osteopenia).  While 3 weeks post-injury is unlikely to be directly related to Keppra-induced bone thinning, it *increases* the importance of getting a proper diagnosis to rule out a bone issue.  Falling while having a seizure is also a risk, even if you\u2019re not actively seizing. You need to ensure it\u2019s not a fracture.\n\n**Concerning points:**\n\n* **Duration:** 3 weeks is a concerning amount of time for a simple bruise or minor soft tissue injury to not show *some* improvement.\n* **Location:** The distal tibia is a weight-bearing area.\n* **No Significant Pain *Doesn't* Equal No Problem:** The absence of severe pain doesn't rule out a fracture, stress fracture, or other significant injury.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **See a Doctor (Primary Care or Sports Medicine):** I *strongly* recommend you schedule an appointment with a doctor.  Don\u2019t continue to skate on it. Specifically, a Sports Medicine physician would be ideal, as they have experience with injuries common to your activity.  Tell them about your epilepsy and Keppra use.  This is the most important step.\n2. **X-ray:** The doctor will almost certainly order an X-ray.  This is to rule out a fracture. An X-ray can often identify bone bruises as well, though sometimes they\u2019re subtle.\n3. **Possible Further Imaging (If X-Ray is Negative and Symptoms Persist):** If the X-ray is normal, but the lump persists being tender, the doctor might consider:\n    * **MRI:** An MRI is much better for visualizing soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles) and can detect bone bruises or early stress fractures that don't show up on X-ray.\n    * **Bone Scan:**  Can detect areas of increased bone activity, which can indicate a stress fracture or other bone problem.\n4. **RICE Protocol (While Waiting for Appointment):**\n    * **Rest:** Absolutely no skating or activities that aggravate the area.\n    * **Ice:** Apply ice packs to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day.  Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your skin.\n    * **Compression:** Use an elastic bandage to provide gentle compression. Don\u2019t wrap it too tightly.\n    * **Elevation:** Elevate your leg above your heart whenever possible.\n\n\n\n**What to tell the Doctor:**\n\n* Detailed description of the injury and how it happened.\n* When the lump first appeared.\n* How the pain/sensitivity has changed over time.\n* Your skating frequency and intensity.\n* Your medications (Keppra) and medical history (Epilepsy).\n* Mention your concern about a possible bone issue, given your medication.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hello, my relative started falling unconscious out of nowhere a year ago. She has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to one shaking seizure. After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this *is* a really frustrating and scary situation, and you're right to be looking for more information. It sounds like you've been through a lot with your relative, and being \"lost\" and feeling helpless is completely understandable. It's good you're reaching out. Here's a breakdown of possible considerations, what to ask doctors, and things to keep in mind. I'll try to be thorough. **Please read the disclaimer at the end as I am not a medical professional.**\n\n**Understanding the Complexity**\n\nThe core issue is unexplained loss of consciousness (syncope) combined with neurological symptoms like memory lapses. The fact that it's happening, even *after* epilepsy medication, and the cyclical nature she's noticing (around the menstrual cycle) are important clues.  The MS possibility being raised and then dismissed adds to the confusion.  It's entirely possible (and common) for diagnosis to be complex and take time.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes to Explore (Beyond Epilepsy and MS)**\n\nGiven the information, here's a range of possibilities doctors should be considering.  I'm listing these to give *you* information to discuss with them, not to self-diagnose.\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the most common cause of fainting. It's a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, often triggered by emotional stress, pain, prolonged standing, or dehydration.  It *can* occur before or during menstruation due to hormonal shifts. *However*, recurrent unexplained vasovagal syncope warrants further investigation, especially with associated neurological symptoms.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** A drop in blood pressure upon standing.  Similar to vasovagal syncope, but specifically related to position change.\n* **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats can cause fainting due to reduced blood flow to the brain. This is a *critical* thing to rule out.\n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** This affects blood flow to the brain primarily when standing triggerring fainting.  It\u2019s common in young women and often linked to menstrual cycles.\n* **Cyclical Seizures (Catamenial Epilepsy):** Epilepsy *can* be tied to hormonal fluctuations in the menstrual cycle.  The fact that her symptoms seem linked to her period strongly suggests this.  The initial seizure *might* have been a consequence of this connection, and the medication isn't fully controlling the cyclical seizures.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  This is a condition where neurological symptoms occur without an apparent structural cause. It's *not* \"all in the head\"\u2013 it's a real neurological problem, but the issue lies in how the brain is functioning, not in visible damage.  It's often linked to stress or trauma.  *However*, this is a diagnosis of exclusion \u2013 meaning other things *must* be ruled out first.\n* **Migraine Variants:** Some types of migraines can cause transient neurological symptoms, including loss of consciousness, even without a headache.\n* **Hormonal Imbalances:** Outside of the cycle, broader hormonal issues (thyroid, adrenal) could contribute.\n* **Rare conditions:** While MS was explored, other rare neurological conditions could also be considered, depending on other symptoms.\n\n**Crucial Tests and Evaluations**\n\nHere's what *should* be happening or considered if it hasn't already:\n\n1. **Extended EEG Monitoring:**  A standard EEG only captures brain activity for a short time.  An *ambulatory EEG* (wearing an EEG device for 24-72 hours, or even longer) is crucial to catch events that happen sporadically.  Ideally, this should include monitoring *around* her menstrual cycle.  Video-EEG monitoring (where her brain activity is recorded while she is also video recorded) is the gold standard for diagnosing seizures.\n2. **Cardiac Evaluation:** This is *essential*. \n   * **Holter Monitor:**  Records heart rhythm for 24-48 hours.\n   * **Event Recorder:**  Worn for weeks, activated when she feels symptoms.\n   * **Echocardiogram:** Ultrasound of the heart.\n   * **Tilt Table Test:** To assess for POTS and orthostatic hypotension.\n3. **Blood Tests:**\n    * **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Checks for anemia, infection.\n    * **Electrolytes:** Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium.\n    * **Thyroid Function Tests:** TSH, T4, T3.\n    * **Hormone Levels:**  Especially estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and potentially prolactin.  Monitor these *throughout* her cycle if possible.\n    * **Vitamin D and B12 levels:** Deficiencies can sometimes contribute to neurological symptoms. \n4. **Neurological Exam:** A thorough neurological exam each time she is seen.\n5. **Review of MRI Scans:**  A radiologist specializing in neurology should review *all* previous MRI scans to ensure nothing was missed.  Sometimes subtle findings are overlooked.\n6. **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):**  If MS is still in the differential (even if less likely), a lumbar puncture can help rule it out by looking for markers of inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n\n\n**Questions to Ask the Neurologist**\n\nWrite these down and take them to the appointment:\n\n*   \"Given the continued fainting and the cyclical nature, could this be catamenial epilepsy, and if so, what are the treatment options?\"\n*   \u201cWhat other types of seizures could be presenting this way?\u201d\n*   \"What cardiac investigations have been done, and are more needed?\"\n*   \"What is your current working diagnosis, and what tests are you doing to confirm or rule it out?\"\n*   \"What is the plan if the current medications aren\u2019t working?\"\n*   \"Could this be related to POTS or another blood pressure regulation problem?\"\n*   \"Is it possible a functional neurological disorder is contributing, and if so, what does that treatment look like?\"\n*   \"What are the risks of continuing to have these episodes, especially the head injuries?\"\n*   \"Can we get a second opinion at a specialized Epilepsy Center or a comprehensive neurological center?\" (This is often a very good idea if you feel stuck).\n*   \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of any medications you prescribe?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Detailed Diary:**  Encourage your relative to keep a *very* detailed diary of her symptoms. This should include:\n    *   Date and time of each event\n    *   What she was doing beforehand\n    *   What she felt *before* it happened (lightheaded, dizzy, anxious, nauseous, vision changes, etc.)\n    *   What happened *during* the event (did she fall, lose consciousness completely, have any jerking movements, etc.)\n    *   How long it lasted\n    *   How she felt *after* the event\n    *   Her menstrual cycle phase.\n* **Safety:**  Prioritize safety.  She should avoid activities that could be dangerous if she were to lose consciousness (driving, swimming, being alone in high places).  Consider wearing a medical ID bracelet.\n\n**Where to Find Specialized Care:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Centers:**  These centers have specialized expertise in diagnosing and treating epilepsy.  Find one near you through the Epilepsy Foundation: [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **Comprehensive Neurological Centers:** Large academic medical centers often have comprehensive neurology departments that can handle complex cases.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The best course of action is to discuss your concerns with her doctors and advocate for thorough investigation and appropriate care.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.  It's a lot of information, but I wanted to give you a framework for advocating for your relative's health.  Please feel free to ask if you have more questions.

I don't have any signs of seizures when I wake up. It's always been hard to wake up in the mornings, but lately it's been awful. It feels like I didn't sleep at all.I was working today. I closed my eyes to blink, and everything was kinda dizzy, but it went away quick. It's hard to describe, it's kinda like dizziness, but also like everything's... dropping? Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds understandably concerning, and you're right to be paying attention to these changes, even if you've been stable on Keppra for a while. Let's break down what you're describing and what it could potentially mean, and *most importantly*, what you should do next.  I'm an AI and cannot give medical advice, so this is for informational purposes only, and a doctor's consultation is crucial.\n\n**Here's a summary of your situation:**\n\n* **Well-controlled Epilepsy:**  Keppra (levetiracetam) has been working well for 3-4 years. That's excellent!\n* **New and Worsening Fatigue:** Significant tiredness despite adequate sleep. This is a key change.\n* **Difficult Mornings:**  Increased difficulty waking up, feeling unrefreshed.\n* **Brief, Unusual Sensory Event:** A fleeting sensation described as dizziness *and* a \u201cdropping/melting\u201d feeling, almost like a mini-myoclonic jerk *without* the jerk itself.  This is the most concerning part.\n* **No Observed Seizures:** No visible seizures or post-ictal state upon waking.\n* **Question about Tolerance:**  You're wondering if Keppra might be losing effectiveness over time.\n\n\n\n**Let's address the possibilities, and I'll categorize them.  It's important to understand these are *potential* explanations, and a doctor needs to evaluate you to determine the cause.**\n\n**1. Keppra Related Issues (Most Important to Discuss with Your Doctor)**\n\n* **Tolerance/Decreased Effectiveness:**  While Keppra doesn't build a *classic* tolerance in the way some medications do, the brain *can* adapt.  Sometimes, the underlying epilepsy itself changes, requiring a medication adjustment even if you've been stable.  It's possible Keppra isn't providing the same level of control as it once was, and you're starting to experience subtle breakthrough phenomena.  *This is a primary concern given the new sensory experience.*\n* **Side Effects (Even After Years):** Though you've been on it for years, side effects can sometimes emerge or worsen over time.  Fatigue is a known side effect of Keppra, even if it wasn't prominent before.  The strange \"dropping/melting\" sensation could *potentially* be a subtle atypical aura or a very mild partial seizure manifestation, even without a full-blown seizure.  Keppra is generally well-tolerated, but subtle central nervous system effects are possible.\n* **Drug Interactions:** Have you started any new medications (prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements) recently?  Even seemingly harmless things can interact with Keppra.\n\n**2. Non-Epilepsy Related Issues (Still Important to Explore with Your Doctor, but Less Directly Linked to Epilepsy)**\n\n* **Sleep Disorders:**  While you say you're getting \"good sleep,\" that's subjective.  Conditions like sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or other sleep disturbances can cause profound fatigue even if you're unaware of waking up frequently.\n* **Iron Deficiency/Anemia:**  A common cause of fatigue, especially in women.  A simple blood test can rule this out.\n* **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Another common cause of fatigue.\n* **Thyroid Issues:** Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can cause significant fatigue.\n* **Depression/Anxiety:**  Mental health conditions can manifest as fatigue and can also sometimes alter sensory perception.\n* **Stress:**  High levels of stress can worsen fatigue and contribute to unusual sensations.\n* **Dehydration:**  Even mild dehydration can cause fatigue and dizziness.\n* **Migraine:**  Some migraine auras can present with unusual sensory disturbances.\n\n**3. The \"Dropping/Melting\" Sensation - Specifically**\n\nThis is the most concerning part of your description. It sounds like a very brief, subtle disturbance in neurological function.  Here's why it needs evaluation:\n\n* **Simple Partial Seizure:** This could be a very mild form of a simple partial seizure, originating in an area of the brain responsible for spatial awareness or sensory processing.  The fact that it's fleeting and doesn't result in a full seizure doesn't rule this out.\n* **Aura:**  It could be a subtle aura preceding a seizure, even if you don't always experience a full seizure afterward.\n* **Non-Epileptic Event:** It's also possible it's *not* seizure-related, but a transient neurological phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n**What You *Need* to Do:**\n\n1. **Contact Your Neurologist ASAP:**  Do *not* wait for your next scheduled appointment. Describe these changes in detail.  Emphasize the new fatigue and *especially* the \u201cdropping/melting\u201d sensation.  Be as specific as possible. Tell them it\u2019s concerning you because it feels like a mini-myoclonic jerk but without the jerk.\n2. **Keep a Detailed Log:**  Before your appointment, start a log of:\n    * **Times of the \"dropping/melting\" sensations:** When do they occur? What were you doing? How long do they last?\n    * **Fatigue Levels:**  Rate your fatigue on a scale of 1-10 throughout the day.\n    * **Sleep:**  Record your bedtime, wake-up time, and how rested you feel.\n    * **Medications/Supplements:**  List everything you\u2019re taking.\n    * **Stress Levels:** Briefly note any significant stressors.\n3. **Blood Tests:** Be prepared for your doctor to order blood tests to rule out anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid problems. They may also check your Keppra levels to ensure you are within the therapeutic range. They may also order an EEG.\n4. **Be Honest:**  Don't downplay your symptoms, even if they seem minor.  Your doctor needs accurate information to make the best assessment.\n\n**Don't:**\n\n* **Adjust Your Keppra Dosage:**  *Never* change your medication dosage without your doctor's explicit instructions.\n* **Self-Diagnose:**  The internet is helpful for information, but it's no substitute for a professional medical evaluation.\n* **Dismiss It as Just Tiredness:** The unusual sensory experience is what makes this particularly important to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n**To help your neurologist understand, think about these questions:**\n\n*  Does the \"dropping/melting\" sensation happen with any specific movements or activities?\n*  Does it feel localized to one part of your body, or is it a whole-body sensation?\n*  Is there any accompanying feeling of fear, anxiety, or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\n*  Has anything else changed in your life recently (stress, diet, exercise, etc.)?\n\n\n\n\nI truly hope you get this checked out quickly and find a solution to feeling better.  It's good you're being proactive about your health.  Let me know if you have any other questions (although I can't provide medical advice, I can help you formulate questions for your doctor).\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

After some time and different pill combinations she is still fainting seemingly randomly but mostly before her period ( she said she noticed fainting every 2 weeks but take it with a grain of salt ). After multiple MR scans and 2 different hospitals in two different towns neurologist said she might have MS and gave her corticosteroids which after about a month they withdrew and said she might not have MS. We are completely lost on what to do and its making her life a living hell as she cant keep a job or/and is dangerous to have one as she hit her head multiple times already. Recently she didnt fall unconscious but sort of lost memory of what she was doing at the moment kind of being on autopilot for a few seconds. Please any help is kindly accepted and feel free to ask away any questions I am happy to answer.Age: 22 Female 5,5 Ft, 160 Lbs Non smoker",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really difficult situation, and I understand your frustration and concern. It sounds like your relative has been through a lot of uncertainty and medical 'stop-start' which is incredibly stressful. Here's a breakdown of thoughts, potential avenues for investigation, and advice, keeping in mind I am an AI and **cannot provide medical diagnoses or treatment plans.** This is for informational purposes only and a doctor needs to guide care.\n\n**Understanding the Complexity**\n\nThe combination of symptoms - unexplained loss of consciousness, potential cyclical relation to her menstrual cycle, a previous epilepsy diagnosis, suspicion of MS that was then retracted, and now these 'autopilot' episodes - makes this a complex case. It means we need to consider several possibilities, and potentially look *beyond* the initial diagnoses for a fuller picture.  The fact that she's hitting her head during these episodes is particularly concerning and needs to be addressed urgently.\n\n\n\n**Let's break down the possibilities and areas to explore, categorized:**\n\n**1. Epilepsy - Reevaluation Needed**\n\n*   **Type of Epilepsy:** Just because she had *one* shaking (tonic-clonic) seizure doesn't automatically define her epilepsy. There are *many* types of epilepsy, and some present with brief loss of consciousness (absence seizures, focal seizures with impaired awareness) that *don't* involve shaking. Some are triggered by hormonal fluctuations.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  Has she had *multiple* EEGs, including one *during* an episode if possible? A single normal EEG doesn\u2019t rule out epilepsy.  Ambulatory EEG monitoring (wearing an EEG device for 24-72 hours or even longer) is important to capture events.\n*   **Seizure Diary:**  Detailed documentation is crucial.  Record *everything* - date, time, what she was doing before, any potential triggers (stress, lack of sleep, before/during/after her period), exactly what happened during the event (did she fall, was there any shaking, how long did it last, what was she like afterward - confused, tired, etc.), and any post-ictal symptoms (confusion, headache, weakness).\n*   **Medication Review:** Is she taking the epilepsy medication consistently and at the correct dosage?  Some medications have side effects that could mimic other problems.  Could the medication be contributing to the 'autopilot' episodes?\n\n**2.  Menstrual Cycle Related Issues (Catamenial Epilepsy/Syndromes)**\n\n*   **Catamenial Epilepsy:** This is epilepsy where seizures are specifically linked to the menstrual cycle. Hormonal fluctuations can lower the seizure threshold. It's very important to identify if this is happening.\n*   **Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) / Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD):**  Severe PMS/PMDD can cause significant neurological symptoms in some women,  although typically not *complete* loss of consciousness.\n*   **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** This affects blood flow and can cause fainting, dizziness, and cognitive issues, especially when upright. Symptoms can be worsened by menstruation.\n* **Migraine Associated Vertigo:** Migraines can cause all sorts of neurological symptoms including dizziness, vertigo, and even temporary loss of consciousness or periods of altered awareness.\n\n**3.  Cardiac Issues**\n\n*   **Arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats can cause fainting (syncope) due to reduced blood flow to the brain. A Holter monitor (continuous ECG recording for 24-48 hours) and possibly an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be considered if not already done.\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a common cause of fainting, triggered by things like stress, pain, or prolonged standing. However, the cyclical nature of *her* fainting makes this less likely as a sole explanation.\n\n**4. Neurological Conditions \u2013 Beyond MS**\n\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a condition where neurological symptoms (like weakness, seizures, or loss of consciousness) are caused by problems with how the brain *functions*, rather than structural damage.  It\u2019s often triggered by stress or trauma, and can be very disabling. *It is not \"all in her head\"*; it is a real neurological condition.\n*   **Narcolepsy:** While less common, this sleep disorder can cause sudden sleep attacks and brief periods of paralysis, which could potentially be mistaken for fainting.\n*    **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):**  While less likely in a 22-year-old, a TIA (mini-stroke) can sometimes cause temporary neurological symptoms.\n\n**5.  Other Considerations**\n\n*   **Dehydration/Low Blood Sugar:**  Is she eating regularly and staying hydrated?  These can contribute to fainting spells.\n*   **Anemia:**  Low iron levels can cause fatigue, dizziness, and fainting.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding the 'Autopilot' Episodes (Possible Focal Seizures or Absence Seizures)**\n\nThese are particularly concerning. This sounds like a *focal seizure with impaired awareness*.  She\u2019s conscious, but not fully aware of her surroundings or actions. This is different than a complete loss of consciousness.  \n\n**What to Do \u2013 A Plan of Action**\n\n1.  **Return to a Neurologist:**  A *second opinion* from a different, highly experienced neurologist, preferably one specializing in epilepsy and/or young adult neurological disorders, is essential.  Bring *all* medical records.\n2.  **Comprehensive Epilepsy Evaluation:** Push for a complete epilepsy workup, including:\n    *   **Extended EEG Monitoring:**  Wearable EEG for several days to try to capture an event.\n    *   **Video-EEG Monitoring:**  If possible, being monitored in a hospital setting while an event occurs, with simultaneous EEG and video recording. This is the gold standard.\n3.  **Detailed Symptom Diary:**  As mentioned before, this is critical.  Record everything.\n4.  **Cardiac Evaluation:** If not already done, a cardiology workup including a Holter monitor and echocardiogram.\n5.  **Blood Tests:** A complete blood count (CBC), iron studies, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests.\n6.  **Menstrual Cycle Tracking:** Very precise tracking of her cycle and relating symptoms to each phase.\n7.  **Consider a Neuropsychological Evaluation:** This can help identify any subtle cognitive deficits that might be contributing to the problem or are a result of the episodes.\n8. **Functional Neurological Disorder Assessment:** If other tests are negative, a specialist in FND can assess for this possibility.\n\n**Important Safety Measures**\n\n*   **Avoid activities that could be dangerous if she were to lose consciousness:**  Driving, swimming alone, working at heights, operating heavy machinery. Explain this to her employers if possible.\n*   **Inform close friends/family:**  They should know what to do if she has an episode.\n*   **Wear a medical ID bracelet:**  This can provide important information to first responders.\n* **Protective Gear:** If she is prone to falling, consider recommending she wear a helmet during activities where head injury is a risk.\n\n\n\n\n**Questions for *You* to Answer (to help me understand better \u2013 but remember, *you still need a doctor*):**\n\n*   What did the MRIs show, specifically?  Were there any abnormalities reported?\n*   What specific epilepsy medications has she tried, and for how long? What were the dosages?\n*   Describe the \"autopilot\" episodes in as much detail as possible. How long do they last? Does she respond to questions during them? Does she remember them afterward?\n*   Is there a family history of epilepsy, fainting, heart problems, or neurological disorders?\n*   How would you describe her stress levels? Has she experienced any recent trauma or significant life changes?\n*   What did the neurologists say *specifically* about why they ruled out MS?  What tests or findings led them to that conclusion?\n\n\n\n\n**Advocacy is key:** You're doing exactly the right thing by being proactive and researching.  Don\u2019t be afraid to push for answers and advocate for your relative's needs.  It may take time and persistence to get a clear diagnosis, but it\u2019s crucial to keep searching for solutions.\n\nI truly hope this provides a helpful starting point.  Please keep me updated if you can, and I wish you and your relative all the best.  Remember to prioritize professional medical advice above all else.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "28F 5\u20196\u201d 225lbs non smokerA little less than a month ago, I had two seizures in the span of 24 hours due to postpartum eclampsia. I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most. Being alone with my newborn and having another seizure because I got off the meds. Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're absolutely right to be proactive and advocate for yourself, especially given your situation with a new baby. It's incredibly frustrating when a doctor isn't responsive and doesn't fully address your concerns \u2013 *especially* when those concerns involve the safety of your child. Let's break down your situation and then discuss what steps you should take.  I will preface this with a **disclaimer at the end - I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* continue to discuss this with a medical professional.**\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n* **Postpartum Eclampsia & Seizures:** You experienced eclampsia (seizures due to high blood pressure in pregnancy), which is a serious but thankfully *usually* a one-time occurrence once the blood pressure is controlled.  The seizures were a *symptom* of the eclampsia, not necessarily indicative of a new-onset epilepsy.  This is a crucial distinction.\n* **Keppra as a \"Safety Net\":** The neurologist prescribed Keppra as a prophylactic measure \u2013 meaning to *prevent* another seizure *while your body recovered* and your blood pressure normalized.  It\u2019s not a long-term epilepsy treatment in your case, based on what you\u2019ve described.\n* **Short Duration of Treatment:** You've been on Keppra for less than a month. This is a relatively short course, which generally reduces the risk of significant withdrawal symptoms or rebound seizures *compared to someone on it for years*.\n* **Your Concerns are Valid:** Your anxieties about coming off medication while solely responsible for a newborn are extremely reasonable. You *need* to be at your best and able to respond to your baby's needs.\n\n\n\n**Addressing Your Questions**\n\n**1. \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control?\"**\n\nThis is the core of your concern, and rightly so.  *Generally*, if the underlying cause (the eclampsia and high blood pressure) is resolved, and you haven't had any further seizures since the blood pressure was controlled, the risk of a seizure *directly related to the eclampsia* is very low.  Keppra was added as a precaution while recovery took place. However, *no doctor can guarantee* a zero percent risk.  The short duration of Keppra use is reassuring, but the brain is complex.\n\n**2. \"Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?\"**\n\nThis is where communication with your neurologist is vital \u2013 and where you're hitting a wall. Here's a breakdown of the options:\n\n* **Gradual Weaning:**  Even though you've been on it a short time, a gradual taper is *generally* preferred. This minimizes potential withdrawal symptoms (which we\u2019ll discuss below).  A typical taper might involve reducing the dose by 250-500mg every few days, under medical supervision.\n* **Direct Discontinuation:**  Because of the short duration of treatment and the fact that this was a reactive, not preventative, medication, some neurologists *might* be comfortable with directly stopping the medication, *particularly* with close monitoring. *However*, this would be a decision made *with* you and with a clear understanding of the potential for withdrawal symptoms and a plan to manage them.\n* **Withdrawal Symptoms:** Keppra withdrawal can, unfortunately, cause anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and even mood swings. While not generally dangerous (like seizures), these symptoms *could* significantly impact your ability to care for your baby. Some people experience no symptoms at all, others mild, and a smaller percentage have more noticeable effects.\n\n**What You Should Do \u2013 Advocate for Yourself**\n\n1. **Document Everything:** Keep a log of:\n    *   When you contacted the neurologist's office.\n    *   Who you spoke to.\n    *   What you asked.\n    *   What the response was (or lack thereof). This provides a clear record if you need to escalate your concerns.\n\n2. **Attempt Further Contact:** Try *again* to reach the neurologist. Be very specific in your message:  \"I am increasingly anxious about discontinuing Keppra while being the sole caregiver for my newborn. I need a detailed plan for how to safely come off the medication, including whether a taper is recommended and what potential withdrawal symptoms I should expect, and how to handle them. I need this plan in writing.\"  If you email, request a read receipt.\n\n3. **Seek a Second Opinion \u2013 *Immediately*:**  This is the most important step.  Given your doctor's unresponsiveness and your critical situation, you *need* a second opinion from another neurologist, ideally one with experience in postpartum complications.  Explain your history, your concerns, and the lack of communication from your current neurologist.  \n\n4. **Prepare Questions for the Second Opinion:**\n    *   \"Based on my history of eclampsia and the short duration of Keppra use, what is the estimated risk of a seizure after discontinuation?\"\n    *   \"Do you recommend a taper, and if so, what would that look like?\"\n    *   \"What potential withdrawal symptoms can I expect, and how can I manage them while caring for my baby?\"\n    *   \u201cWhat signs/symptoms should I watch for that would indicate I need to seek immediate medical attention (e.g., seizure, extreme anxiety, severe mood changes)?\u201d\n    *    \"What is your opinion on the necessity of continuing Keppra at all, given my current stable blood pressure?\"\n\n5. **Consider a Postpartum Support Group:**  The emotional stress of this situation is significant.  Connecting with other new mothers can provide invaluable support and understanding.\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **Never stop any medication abruptly without medical advice.**\n* **Have a support system in place.**  Even if it's just knowing you can call a family member or friend if you feel overwhelmed.\n* **Prioritize your own well-being.**  Taking care of yourself is essential for taking care of your baby.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your situation is complex and requires the individualized attention of a medical professional.\n\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope you get the answers and support you need.  You are doing the right thing by being proactive and advocating for yourself and your baby.  Please take care."

        "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack, and you're understandably anxious and confused. Let's break down your situation, address your questions, and try to bring clarity.  I'm going to give you a detailed response, but **please remember I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only. You *must* discuss all concerns with your medical team.**\n\n**First, a quick recap of what we know:**\n\n* **You have significant comorbidities:** Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all of which increase vascular risk.\n* **Initial Event:**  Sudden onset of sensations (electric shock feeling), followed by collapse and witnessed convulsions and a period of unresponsiveness.\n* **8mm Brain Lesion:** Initially concerning, but now believed to be vascular, *not* cancerous.\n* **Carotid Artery Narrowing:** Confirmed on CTA, raising suspicion of a carotid dissection.\n* **Diagnostic Angiogram:** Tomorrow \u2013 this is crucial for confirming the dissection and its extent.\n* **Dual Treatment:**  Being followed by both a neurologist (for seizure possibility) and a neurosurgeon (for the vascular issue).\n* **Medication:**  Switched from Keppra (side effects) to Vimpat (also with side effects).\n* **Recurring Premonitory Sensation:**  \"Pit of the stomach\" feeling preceding nocturnal episodes.\n\n\n\n**Let's address your questions, one by one:**\n\n**1. Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature?**\n\nThis is the core question, and understandably difficult to answer definitively right now. **It's possible to have *both* seizure activity and a vascular cause, or that the vascular issue is *causing* seizure-like activity.** Here's why:\n\n*   **Vascular events (like dissection/TIA/stroke) can absolutely cause seizures.** A disruption of blood flow to the brain, even a temporary one, can irritate brain tissue and trigger abnormal electrical activity. These are sometimes called \"secondary seizures.\"\n*   **The initial event could have been a seizure, a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack), or a combination of both.**  The convulsions are suggestive of a seizure. The sensations you described could be *aura* associated with a seizure, *or* they could be the symptoms of a TIA as blood flow was interrupted. Sometimes it's hard to differentiate in retrospect, especially without a clear EEG during the event.\n*   **Your recurring \"pit of the stomach\" feeling** is important. This *could* be a subtle aura before a seizure, a feeling related to the vascular issue (like a subtle drop in blood flow or change in blood pressure), or even anxiety triggered by the experience of the initial event.  It's also possible to experience premonitory symptoms with vascular events.\n\n**2. Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures?**\n\n**Yes, absolutely.** As mentioned above, a carotid dissection (or any stroke/TIA) can disrupt blood supply, leading to cerebral ischemia (lack of oxygen to the brain). This can trigger seizures.  The proximity of the dissection to brain areas responsible for seizure control could be a factor.  The mechanism isn't always fully understood, but it's a known association.\n\n**3. What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner.**\n\nYou're right to be skeptical.  Typical TIA symptoms are often described as weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, or vision changes. *However*, TIAs can present atypically. The \"electric shock\" sensation isn\u2019t a classic TIA symptom.  The convulsions are very atypical of a standard TIA. This is why the complexity of your case requires thorough investigation.  The combination of symptoms suggests something more than a typical TIA.  It's clear why your doctors are considering both seizure and vascular explanations, and actively working to determine the root cause.\n\n**4. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)?**\n\nThis is a valid and important question. *It's too early to say.* \n\n*   **If the vascular issue is the primary cause of your episodes, and it can be addressed with treatment (e.g., stenting the carotid artery), then you *might* eventually be able to wean off the seizure medication.**  The goal would be for the vascular problem to be resolved, preventing further irritation and potential seizure activity.\n*   **If seizures continue *even after* addressing the vascular issue, or if they are deemed to be a separate seizure disorder (epilepsy), then longer-term medication may be necessary.**\n*   **Your neurologist should be actively monitoring your case, and adjusting medication based on your response and EEG results (if applicable).**  Brain fog and other side effects are commonly reported with these drugs, so it's important to communicate them to your doctor.  He may try different medications to find one you tolerate better. Don\u2019t suffer in silence with side effects; voice them!\n\n**5. Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?**\n\nIt's *possible*, but not a foregone conclusion.  \n\n*   **\"Epilepsy\" is defined as having recurrent, unprovoked seizures.**  You've had one event that involved convulsive activity, and now recurring premonitory symptoms. *That alone doesn't automatically mean you have epilepsy.*\n*   **The key is to determine if the seizures are provoked (i.e., caused by the vascular issue) or unprovoked.** If provoked and easily identified, the long-term management may be different.\n*   **The diagnostic angiogram and continued neurological monitoring are crucial to determining this.**\n\n\n\n**What's Next (and what you should discuss with your doctors):**\n\n* **The Angiogram:** This is the *most important* test right now. It will determine the extent of the carotid dissection (if present) and guide treatment decisions.\n* **Discuss the results of the angiogram *thoroughly* with both your neurosurgeon and neurologist.**  Ask specifically about the following:\n    *   Is there a dissection?  How severe is it?\n    *   What is the plan for managing the vascular issue? (Stenting?  Medication?)\n    *   What is the likelihood that the vascular issue is causing the episodes, versus a separate seizure disorder?\n    *   What are your options for managing Vimpat's side effects?  Can the dosage be adjusted, or can they try a different medication?\n    *   When will they consider an EEG in a hospital setting to capture the activity during one of your nocturnal episodes?\n* **Keep a detailed symptom diary.**  Record the time, nature, and duration of your premonitory sensations and any other symptoms you experience. This will be valuable information for your doctors.\n* **Address your comorbidities.** Continue working with your primary care physician to manage your obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. This will improve your overall vascular health.\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou're facing a complex medical situation, so it's normal to feel anxious and confused. You are doing the right thing by seeking excellent medical care and asking questions.  Be your own advocate. Don't hesitate to push for answers and express your concerns. A collaborative approach with your medical team is essential for getting to the root of this problem and developing the best possible treatment plan.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Why does my head feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking when I put my hands on my forehead and press them down into my pillow ? I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5\u20199 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I\u2019m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don\u2019t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress. They booked me in with a neurologist but it might take 3 week. What\u2019s wrong with me ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're understandably worried. You're experiencing a constellation of symptoms - twitching, a perceived shaking sensation in your head, and a history of epilepsy - and you're waiting for a neurologist appointment. Let's break down what might be going on, given the information you've provided. **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**\n\n**Here's a considered look at things, organized for clarity:**\n\n**1. The Head \"Shaking\" Sensation:**\n\n* **Possible Explanation:  Muscle Tension and Proprioception.** What you're describing, feeling a subtle tremor or shaking when pressing your head into a pillow, can be linked to several factors. Your doctors are likely on the right track considering stress.\n    * **Muscle Tension:**  Anxiety and stress often lead to increased muscle tension, especially in the neck and scalp.  When you apply pressure (like pushing into the pillow) this tension can become more noticeable, presenting *as* a slight \"shaking\" sensation.  It's not your brain physically shaking, but your muscles responding to the pressure with subtle contractions.\n    * **Proprioception:** This is your body's sense of where it is in space.  If you\u2019re tense, your proprioceptive sense can become heightened, making you more aware of normal, tiny muscle movements and perceive them as shaking.\n    * **The Pillow Effect:** The pillow itself provides resistance.  This resistance can amplify any minor muscle activity.\n\n* **Less Likely (but considered, given your history):** While your neurologist in Poland suggested you\u2019d likely only experience absence seizures, it's *always* possible for seizure presentation to evolve. However, the described sensation is atypical for a seizure.\n\n**2. The Twitching (Fasciculations):**\n\n* **Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS):**  This is the most likely diagnosis *given* what your doctors have said. BFS is characterized by random, involuntary muscle twitches. It's benign (not harmful) but can be very anxiety-provoking because it feels odd. It's very commonly triggered by stress, anxiety, caffeine, dehydration, and sometimes even strenuous exercise.\n* **Medication Side Effect:** Epilim (valproic acid) *can*, in rare cases, cause muscle twitching as a side effect. It's important to discuss this with your neurologist. They will consider if your dosage is appropriate.\n* **Electrolyte Imbalance:**  Though less likely, an imbalance of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, calcium) can sometimes cause twitching.\n* **Neurological Cause:** While your doctors are leaning towards stress, the new onset of twitching *does* warrant investigation, which is why the neurology appointment is crucial. It's important to rule out other, less common, neurological causes.\n\n**3. The Potential Body \"Shaking\" During Sleep:**\n\n* **Hypnic Jerks:** These are very common, sudden, involuntary muscle contractions that happen as you\u2019re falling asleep.  They often feel like a \"jolt\" or a sudden shake.  You may not consciously remember them easily.\n* **Myoclonus:** This is a broader term for sudden, brief, involuntary muscle contractions.  Hypnic jerks are *a type* of myoclonus.\n* **Again, Stress/Anxiety:**  Stress can manifest even during sleep.\n\n**4. Connections & Your History:**\n\n* **Epilepsy & Stress:** Living with epilepsy, even controlled, can be stressful. The fear of a seizure, the medication side effects, and the lifestyle adjustments can all contribute to anxiety.\n* **Absence Seizures:**  The fact that you've had absence seizures doesn't automatically mean these new symptoms *are* seizure-related. However, it does mean your brain is prone to atypical electrical activity, and a thorough evaluation is essential.\n\n\n\n**What Should You Do *While Waiting for the Neurologist*?**\n\n* **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**  This is *extremely* helpful for the neurologist.  Note:\n    * **When do the twitches occur?** (Time of day, what you're doing, level of stress)\n    * **Specifically where are the twitches?** (Be precise: \u201cleft upper arm, near the elbow, on the inner side\u201d)\n    * **How long do they last?** \n    * **What makes them better or worse?**\n    * **Describe the head shaking sensation really precisely:**  what position, how strong is it, what does it *feel* like (buzzing, trembling, etc.)\n    * **What\u2019s your stress level like each day?** Use a scale of 1-10.\n* **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n* **Magnesium-Rich Foods:**  Include foods rich in magnesium in your diet (dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, beans). *Do not take magnesium supplements without talking to your Doctor.*\n* **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** These can exacerbate twitching.\n* **Stress Management:**  Even while waiting for the neurologist, actively try to manage stress.  This could include:\n    * **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Even 5-10 minutes a day can help.\n    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n    * **Gentle Exercise:** (Yoga, walking) \u2013 but don't overdo it.\n    * **Hobbies:**  Engage in activities you enjoy.\n* **Medication Review:**  Make a list of *all* of your medications (including dosage) for the neurologist. Be prepared to discuss any recent changes.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask the Neurologist:**\n\n* Is it possible this is related to my epilepsy or Epilim?\n* Could this be Benign Fasciculation Syndrome?\n* Are any further tests needed (e.g., EMG, blood tests)?\n* Should I adjust my medication?\n* What should I do if the symptoms worsen before my next appointment?\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous. You *are* doing the right thing by getting a neurologist appointment.  The information I provided is to help you prepare for that appointment and think through potential causes, but the neurologist will have the expertise to properly diagnose and treat you.\n\n\n\nI hope this is helpful.  I understand this is a stressful time, but you're being proactive by seeking medical attention.  Focus on gathering information for your neurologist and practicing stress management techniques in the meantime."

        "question": "About a month ago i smoked a little weed with my friends at a pool and when i got out i started feeling extremely light headed so i went to go sit down on a lounge chair next thing i knew i was on the ground everything was completely black and i couldn't see or hear anything all i could feel was my body flopping around uncontrollably and i couldn't stop it. The whole experience only lasted about 15 seconds but it felt like 15 minutes then out of nowhere i was able to stand up and my vision cleared and i was fine if anyone has any experience with or knows why this happened please help me im scared there could be underlying health issues i never knew about (i smoke fairly frequently and it never happened prior to this incident or after any help would be greatly appreciated)Edit: mods removed my first post for not adding this so age and gender 16m weight 132lbs height 6'3 no medical issues aside from psychological and im on no medications",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that sounds *terrifying*. It's good you're seeking information and it's completely understandable why you're scared. A sudden, brief loss of consciousness with those kinds of involuntary movements (\"flopping around\") is something that needs to be taken seriously, even if it hasn't happened again. Here's a breakdown of what *could* be going on, and *why* you need to see a doctor.  I will preface this with a **very important disclaimer at the end**.\n\n**Possible Explanations (and why they relate to your experience and weed use):**\n\nSeveral things could be at play; it's unlikely to be *just* the weed, given the involuntary movements. Here are possibilities, ranging from more common to less common, and how they could tie in:\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the *most likely* explanation, especially in the context of being hot, potentially dehydrated (at a pool) and after cannabis use. A vasovagal syncope is a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to a temporary loss of consciousness.  It's often triggered by things like heat, stress, pain (even mild discomfort), or standing up too quickly.  *Why the \"flopping\"?* Sometimes, during a vasovagal episode, the muscles can briefly spasm or go limp as the brain briefly shuts down.  The most common simple faint falls under this.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** Similar to vasovagal syncope, this is a drop in blood pressure when you stand up too quickly.  Being dehydrated or overheating can worsen this. Weed can sometimes lower blood pressure, potentially contributing.\n* **Seizure (Simple Focal or Absence):** While you describe feeling like you lost consciousness, the involuntary movements make this a consideration.  *However*, a typical seizure is usually longer than 15 seconds.  A *simple focal seizure* can manifest with unusual movements, but often with awareness. An *absence seizure* (formerly called petit mal) involves a brief loss of awareness, and sometimes subtle movements. It's less likely if you were completely unaware, but it's important to rule out. The fact that it hasn't happened again makes this less likely but it should be examined.\n* **Cardiac Arrhythmia (Heart Rhythm Problem):** This is less likely, especially given your age and reported lack of other medical issues. But a temporary, brief arrhythmia could cause a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting.  The \"flopping\" could be related to brief muscle contractions caused by a lack of oxygen.  This is more worrisome and needs investigation.\n* **Cannabis-Induced Hypotension/Syncope:** While not usually causing *involuntary* movements like you describe, cannabis *can* lower blood pressure. In rare cases, this could lead to fainting, especially if combined with other factors (heat, dehydration, etc.). However, the movements are not typical.\n* **Less Likely/More Serious:** There are other possibilities like neurological issues, but these are far less likely given your age, history, and the isolated nature of the event.\n\n\n\n**Why the Weed Might Be a Factor (but probably isn't the *sole* cause):**\n\n* **Blood Pressure:** As mentioned, cannabis can lower blood pressure.\n* **Heart Rate:** It can also increase your heart rate initially, which can sometimes contribute to dizziness or fainting.\n* **Dehydration:** Cannabis can cause dry mouth and potentially increased fluid loss.  Being at the pool already increases dehydration risk.\n* **Anxiety:** Sometimes, anxiety associated with cannabis use can trigger a vasovagal response.\n\n**What You *Need* to Do:**\n\n1. **See a Doctor \u2013 VERY IMPORTANT:** This is not something to ignore.  Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician ASAP.  Tell them *exactly* what happened, including the details you've provided here (the duration, the feeling of flopping, the complete loss of vision/hearing).  Don't downplay it because you were using cannabis \u2013 the doctor needs accurate information to help you.\n2. **Tests Your Doctor Might Order:**\n    * **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** To check your heart rhythm.\n    * **Blood Pressure Monitoring (Lying, Sitting, Standing):** To check for orthostatic hypotension.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out electrolyte imbalances or other underlying medical issues.\n    * **Possibly a Referral to a Neurologist:** If the doctor suspects a seizure or other neurological issue, they may refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation (potentially including an EEG \u2013 electroencephalogram \u2013 to measure brain activity).\n3. **Hydrate:** Make sure you're drinking plenty of water, especially when active or in hot weather.\n4. **Be Careful with Cannabis:**  I know you say you smoke frequently, but *temporarily* stop using cannabis until you've been evaluated by a doctor! It will make it much easier to assess what's going on.  If you continue to use, be mindful of staying hydrated and avoiding situations that might lower your blood pressure (heat, strenuous activity).\n\n**Important Considerations for Talking to Your Parents/Guardians:**\n\nI understand you're 16 and might be hesitant to talk to your parents about the cannabis use.  However, your *health* is the priority. Explain to them that you experienced a scary episode, and you need to see a doctor to rule out any underlying health problems. You don't necessarily need to focus on the cannabis if you're worried about getting in trouble, but *do* be honest with the doctor.  A doctor needs to know if you use cannabis to accurately diagnose the cause.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this sounds incredibly frightening, and you were right to be concerned and call for emergency medical help.  What you described is *very* concerning, and it's good you observed and remembered the details as you did.  You are also right to be searching for explanations, but keep in mind **I am not a medical professional and cannot provide a diagnosis.**  I can offer some possible explanations based on your detailed description, but this *absolutely* requires a full medical evaluation.  It's also good you're noticing that standard descriptions don't quite fit, which highlights the complexity of neurological events.\n\nHere's a breakdown of possibilities, considering your observations, along with why your initial thoughts of stroke and epilepsy might not fully align, and some other things to consider.  I'll categorize them and then discuss the troubling laughter.\n\n**1. Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident - CVA)**\n\n*   **Why it's *possible*:** The sudden onset of neurological symptoms (weakness/paralysis manifesting as freezing, altered facial expression, confusion) is a hallmark of stroke. The disorientation and initial unresponsiveness also fit.  A stroke affecting certain areas of the brain *can* cause seemingly bizarre behaviors. Head trauma *can* be both a cause *and* a complication of stroke (see below).\n*   **Why it's *not a perfect* fit:**  Typical strokes don't usually start with a prolonged \"freezing\" phase like you described. The asymmetrical facial movement (right side smiling) is suggestive, but not always the presentation. The foam from the mouth is less common in a typical stroke, though it can occur with severe neurological events.  The ear bleeding *strongly* suggests trauma (see below) but can be related to a hemorrhagic stroke.\n*   **Important Note: Hemorrhagic Stroke:** A stroke can involve bleeding *in* the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). This *can* cause the types of symptoms you saw, *especially* if there was a subsequent head impact that worsened the bleed.\n\n**2. Seizure (Epilepsy or Provoked Seizure)**\n\n*   **Why it's *possible*:** A seizure can certainly cause loss of consciousness, stiffening, and potentially foaming at the mouth. The initial freezing could represent a focal seizure that then generalized.\n*   **Why it's *not a perfect* fit:** While the initial freezing and loss of consciousness are seizure-consistent, the *specific* sequence you described \u2013 prolonged freezing, *then* isolated facial movement (the smile), *then* laughter, *then* stiffening and fall \u2013 is atypical.  Most seizures don't unfold in that particular order. Also, the docent *specifically denied* a history of epilepsy, which doesn't rule it out (epilepsy can start at any age), but makes it less likely as a long-standing condition. Provoked seizures (caused by a specific trigger like a fever, head injury, or metabolic imbalance) are possible.\n*  **Complex Partial Seizure:** Some seizures, called complex partial seizures, can manifest with bizarre behaviors, automatisms (involuntary movements like the smile), and a period of altered awareness before a more generalized seizure. However, the *sequence* remains somewhat unusual.\n\n**3. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) - \"Mini-Stroke\"**\n\n*   **Why it's *possible*:**  A TIA has symptoms similar to a stroke, but they resolve quickly.  It's possible the initial freezing and facial droop were a TIA, and the fall was a separate event (perhaps due to weakness *from* the TIA, or related to a different underlying issue).\n*   **Why it's *not a perfect* fit:** TIAs typically don't cause prolonged loss of consciousness or bleeding from the ear.  The sequence seems too prolonged and dramatic for a typical TIA.\n\n**4. Head Trauma Complicated by Underlying Condition**\n\n*   **Why it's *possible*:**  The impact to the head is a crucial piece of information. Even a seemingly minor impact can trigger or exacerbate an underlying neurological problem. He may have had an undiagnosed aneurysm or other vascular malformation that was weakened. The hit could have caused it to rupture.\n* **Skull Fracture:**  The medics suspecting a skull fracture is very important.  This alone can cause significant neurological symptoms.\n\n**5. Other Neurological Events (Less Likely, But Need Consideration)**\n\n*   **Syncope with Unusual Aura:**  Fainting (syncope) can sometimes be preceded by unusual sensations (an \"aura\"). However, the aura wouldn't usually involve the specific combination of freezing, facial movement, and laughter.\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizure (PNES):** These events can *look* like seizures but are caused by psychological distress rather than abnormal brain electrical activity. However, the physical trauma (head impact, bleeding from the ear) makes this less probable.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding the Disturbing Laughter**\n\nThis is the most disturbing and perplexing part of your description. Here are some possibilities *regarding why* he might have laughed:\n\n*   **Inappropriate Emotional Response:**  Sometimes, neurological events (especially affecting the frontal lobe) can disrupt emotional control, leading to inappropriate or involuntary laughter. It's not a sign of happiness but a release of neurological impulses.\n*   **Automatic Behavior:**  As mentioned in the \u201ccomplex partial seizure\u201d description, involuntary movements and behaviors (automatisms) can occur during a seizure. The laughter could have been one of these.\n*    **Release Phenomenon:**  After a period of intense neurological inhibition (the \"freezing\"), there could be a rebound effect, leading to a temporary release of neurological control and resulting in the laughter.\n*   **Frontal Lobe Involvement:** The frontal lobe is involved in personality, social behavior and emotional regulation. If the stroke or seizure affected that part of the brain, there could be strange emotional expressions.\n\n\n\n**What Happens Now (and what you should know)**\n\n*   **Hospital Evaluation is Critical:**  The docent is (or should be) undergoing a thorough medical workup, including:\n    *   **CT Scan and/or MRI of the brain:**  To look for stroke, bleeding, skull fracture, tumors, or other structural abnormalities.\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To assess brain electrical activity and look for signs of seizure activity.\n    *   **Blood Tests:**  To rule out metabolic causes, infection, and other medical conditions.\n    *   **Neurological Exam:** To assess his reflexes, strength, and cognitive function.\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:**  It's natural to try to understand what happened, but avoid making assumptions.  Let the medical professionals do their job.\n*   **Your Observations Are Valuable:**  Your detailed account is *extremely* helpful to the medical team.  If they contact you for more information, be as precise as possible.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nI genuinely hope your colleague makes a full recovery. This was a frightening event, and you did the right thing by seeking immediate medical assistance.  Please take care of yourself, too \u2013 witnessing something like this can be traumatic.\n\n\n\n"

        "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really valid concern and it's good you're questioning it. You're right to feel uneasy about this situation, and you\u2019re absolutely right to highlight the critical nature of epilepsy medication. Here's a breakdown of why your doctor's approach is *potentially* problematic, what's often considered standard, and what you can discuss tomorrow:\n\n**Is this normal?  Not entirely, but increasingly common...and there are reasons.**\n\n* **Historically:**  Traditionally, neurologists *would* often allow more flexible refills for stable patients on established epilepsy medications like Lamotrigine.  The idea was minimizing disruption to treatment.\n* **Current Trends (and why it's changing):** There\u2019s been a shift in prescribing practices, driven by several factors, and this is what your doctor is likely responding to:\n    * **Increased Scrutiny:**  There's increased pressure on doctors to actively manage chronic conditions and demonstrate ongoing monitoring. Insurance companies and medical boards are looking for evidence of regular assessments.\n    * **Medication Reconciliation & Safety:**  Regular appointments allow the doctor to check for side effects, drug interactions, changes in your health that might affect the medication, and assess if the medication is *still* the most appropriate choice for you.  The 6-month check-in is about ensuring continuing safety and efficacy.\n    * **Compliance:** It ensures you are actively engaged in your health care and are being monitored for effectiveness and potential side effects.\n    * **DEA & State Regulations:** There is increased scrutiny on all prescriptions, even for non-controlled substances, to ensure appropriate prescribing.\n\n**Why your situation is concerning and potentially problematic:**\n\n* **Disruption of Treatment is Dangerous:**  You\u2019re right. Gaps in anti-epileptic medication can *very quickly* lead to breakthrough seizures.  Stopping Lamotrigine abruptly is especially risky (it has specific guidelines for tapering).\n* **Creating Unnecessary Stress:**  Forcing you to scramble for an appointment puts an unreasonable burden on you, particularly given the anxiety that often accompanies epilepsy.\n* **Lack of Contingency:** The fact that the pharmacy renewal was simply *denied* without any attempt to facilitate an appointment (like a quick call from the office) is not ideal patient care.  A good practice would be to *inform* the pharmacy of the need for an appointment and suggest you contact the office.\n* **It's Not a Controlled Substance (Typically):** Lamotrigine is not classified as a controlled substance like opioids or benzodiazepines. The level of restriction feels disproportionate to the risk.\n\n\n**What to discuss with your neurologist *tomorrow*:**\n\nThis is the most important part. Be calm, polite, and clear. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Express Your Concern:**  \"Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to monitor my condition, and I understand the reasons for regular check-ins. However, I was very worried when the pharmacy couldn\u2019t refill my Lamotrigine.  The potential for a lapse in medication is really frightening for me, and I\u2019m concerned about the risk of a seizure.\"\n2. **Ask About the Rationale:** \"Could you explain your reasoning for requiring an appointment for *every* 6-month refill, especially given that I\u2019ve been stable on this medication?\"\n3. **Propose a Solution:**  Offer a compromise.  Some possibilities:\n    * **Automatic Refills with a Periodic Review:** \u201cWould it be possible to have a system where refills are automatically approved for [e.g., 3 months] at a time, but I continue to come in for appointments every 6-12 months for a more thorough review?\"  (It's possible your insurance may affect this)\n    * **Emergency Refill Protocol:**  \"What's the process if I *do* run low unexpectedly and can't get an immediate appointment? Is there a way to get a short-term 'bridge' prescription?\"\n    * **Nurse Line/Telehealth Check-in:** \"Would a quick phone call with the nurse to assess how I\u2019m doing be sufficient for some refills, reserving the in-person appointments for more detailed evaluations?\"\n4. **Discuss Appointment Scheduling:** \u201cI take responsibility for scheduling my appointments.  Going forward, can we discuss a system to help me remember, such as appointment reminders, or perhaps scheduling the next appointment *during* my current appointment?\u201d\n5. **Document Everything:**  Keep a record of your appointments, refill requests, and any conversations with the doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Your State Laws:** Prescription regulations vary by state. Some states have stricter rules than others.\n* **Insurance:** Your insurance may influence the doctor\u2019s prescribing practices.\n* **Your Stability:** If you *have* been seizure-free and have no side effects, emphasize this to your doctor.  A stable patient often warrants a more flexible approach.\n\n\n\n**If you are still unsatisfied after the appointment:**\n\n* **Second Opinion:** Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another neurologist.\n* **Patient Advocate:**  Consider contacting a patient advocacy organization for epilepsy. They can provide support and guidance.  (See resources below).\n\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)  (They have excellent information about medication management and patient rights.)\n* **National Epilepsy Foundation:** https://www.epilepsy.com/living-epilepsy/find-your-epilepsy-foundation-affiliate\n* **Partners Against Epilepsy:** https://www.partnersagainstepilepsy.org/\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *lot* to unpack. It's understandable why you're on the verge of quitting your job and feeling incredibly anxious. It sounds incredibly distressing to go through this diagnostic journey and be grappling with memory loss and uncertainty. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering the epilepsy, the memory issues, the medication, and your concerns about the future.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this isn't medical advice, but a discussion of your situation.**\n\n**1. Understanding Your Diagnosis (Partial Epilepsy)**\n\n* **Partial Epilepsy:** This means the seizures are starting in a specific part of your brain. The symptoms you describe \u2013 burning sensations, tightness, memory problems \u2013 are all *possible* manifestations of partial seizures, even if they don't look like classic \"convulsive\" seizures.  Subtle seizures can manifest in many unusual ways.  The location of the seizures strongly influences the symptoms.\n* **The Delay in Diagnosis:** It's unfortunately not uncommon for partial epilepsy (especially with atypical presentations) to be misdiagnosed or dismissed, especially if it doesn't involve dramatic convulsions.  You're valid in feeling frustrated that it took so long to get an explanation.\n* **Burning Sensation and Tightness:** These are less typical seizure symptoms, but *can* occur, particularly if the seizure activity is impacting sensory pathways or causing muscle tension. The burning you describe is concerning and should be monitored.  The tightness in the back of your head feels particularly related to the potential source of the seizures.\n\n\n\n**2. Your Memory Concerns & Hippocampus**\n\n* **Hippocampus and Memory:** You are right to focus on the hippocampus. It's crucial for forming *new* memories. Damage to or dysfunction of the hippocampus and related structures can definitely cause short-term memory problems. \n* **Epilepsy and Memory:**  Epilepsy *can* directly impact memory, even between seizures.  Repeated seizure-like activity (even subclinical, meaning you don\u2019t fully recognize them as seizures) can disrupt hippocampal function. It can also affect other brain areas vital for cognition.\n* **Is the damage reversible?** This is the big question, and it's where it gets complicated.\n    * **Potentially, yes, at least partially.** If the epilepsy is effectively controlled, and the seizure activity *ceased* or *significantly reduced*, there's a chance for some neurological recovery and improvement in memory.  The brain has some plasticity (ability to reorganize itself).\n    * **However...**  The *length* of time the epilepsy has been active is a crucial factor.  The longer the brain has been experiencing abnormal activity, the less likely full recovery is.  Your epilepsy began in 2017, which is a considerable period. \n    * **The *type* of damage matters:** If the epilepsy is causing actual structural damage to the hippocampus (which can be seen on an MRI, for example), recovery may be limited.\n    * **Early intervention is key:**  That\u2019s why getting the diagnosis *now* and starting treatment is critical.\n* **Alzheimer's in your 30s?** This is understandably your biggest fear.  Early-onset Alzheimer's is rare.  While epilepsy can *increase* the risk of dementia later in life, it doesn't automatically mean you'll develop Alzheimer's.  The type of epilepsy, how well it's controlled, and other risk factors (genetics, lifestyle) all play a role.  Don't jump to this conclusion.\n\n\n\n**3. Your Medication (Zeptol/Carbamazepine)**\n\n* **Carbamazepine:** A common and effective anti-epileptic drug (AED). It works by stabilizing nerve cells, reducing the likelihood of seizures.\n* **Dosage and Timing:**  You\u2019re following your neurologist\u2019s instructions by titrating up.  However, **1-200mg is a relatively low dose.** AEDs often require careful adjustment to find the optimal dose that controls seizures *without* significant side effects. It can take *weeks to months* to find the right dosage.\n* **Why you're not feeling immediate improvement:**\n    * **It takes time:** AEDs don't \"fix\" memory overnight. They need to control the underlying brain activity that's *causing* the memory problems. It will likely take time to see improvements, *if* the medication is effective in controlling the seizures.\n    * **Wrong Dosage:** As mentioned, the current dose might be too low.\n    * **Wrong Medication:** Carbamazepine isn't the right drug for everyone.  Your neurologist may need to try different AEDs to find one that works best for *your* specific type of epilepsy.\n    * **Not solely seizure-related:**  Your memory issues may have multiple contributing factors beyond the epilepsy, such as stress, sleep deprivation, or other underlying health conditions.\n* **Important Side Effects:** Carbamazepine can have side effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, and even cognitive effects. Make sure you discuss any side effects with your neurologist.\n\n**4. What You Need to Do Now**\n\n* **COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR NEUROLOGIST:** This is the most important thing.\n    * **Be specific:**  Tell your neurologist *exactly* what you're experiencing \u2013 the burning, the tightness, the memory problems. Be detailed.  Keep a seizure diary, even if you suspect the events are subtle.  Note the time, what you were doing, and the specific symptoms.\n    * **Ask about further testing:**  An MRI of the brain is crucial to rule out structural abnormalities. An EEG (electroencephalogram) is also important to confirm the epilepsy and pinpoint the seizure focus.  More advanced EEG monitoring might be helpful (video EEG).\n    * **Discuss alternative medications:** If you don't see improvement with carbamazepine within a reasonable timeframe (and after dosage adjustments), talk to your neurologist about trying a different AED.\n    * **Ask about cognitive rehabilitation:**  There are therapies designed to help people with memory and cognitive problems learn strategies to cope and improve function.\n* **Other Prescriptions:** Please share what the other medications are for.  This is important for understanding the overall treatment plan.\n* **Address Stress and Lifestyle:**  Stress significantly exacerbates epilepsy and memory problems.  Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours per night), a healthy diet, and regular exercise (as tolerated).  Consider stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness or yoga.\n* **Job Situation:** I understand your feeling of wanting to quit. However, try to navigate the situation;  explain to your employer that you\u2019re undergoing medical treatment and might need some accommodations.  Consider a temporary reduction in workload or responsibilities.  Quitting should be a last resort.\n\n**5.

        "question": " Yet another EDIT: I fainted today on my way to the store and was brought into the hospital. They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder. Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That's a *lot* to process! First of all, I'm so glad you got to the hospital after fainting and they were able to figure out *something* is going on. That must have been incredibly scary. It's completely understandable why you'd feel like you sound insane \u2013 a lot of these symptoms are unusual and can be hard to connect, and the fact that they've been happening for a while without a clear explanation adds to that.\n\nLet's break down what you've shared, and then talk about how to approach things moving forward:\n\n**1. The Seizures (\"Silent\" Seizures/Non-Convulsive Seizures):**\n\n*   **This is huge.**  \"Silent\" or non-convulsive seizures often *don't* look like the stereotypical shaking seizures. They can manifest as brief periods of altered awareness, staring spells, confusion, or (as you describe) a feeling of losing consciousness while remaining upright. The fact that you've been experiencing these frequently and didn't realize it is *very* common with this type of seizure.\n*   **Triggers:** Sleep deprivation and anxiety are definitely known triggers for seizures in susceptible individuals. It\u2019s good they\u2019ve identified those as possible contributing factors. You definitely need to prioritize sleep and manage anxiety now.\n*   **Past History:** The idea that you may have had these in the past and they subsided is also plausible. Sometimes these things can be episodic.\n*   **Next Steps:**  You'll likely be referred to a neurologist for ongoing management.  They'll likely want to do an EEG (electroencephalogram) to confirm the diagnosis and possibly medication if the seizures are frequent or interfering with your life.\n\n**2. Potential Gastroparesis:**\n\n*   **Amazing they're looking into this!** Gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) can explain *so* many of your symptoms: nausea, vomiting, feeling full quickly, weight loss, poor appetite. \n*   **The Gastric Emptying Study:** This test is the gold standard for diagnosing gastroparesis. It involves eating a meal containing a radioactive tracer and then having scans done over several hours to see how quickly your stomach empties.  Understanding its severity will be key to treatment.\n*   **Possible Causes:** Gastroparesis can be caused by diabetes, surgery, certain medications, or (often) be *idiopathic* (meaning the cause is unknown).  The fact that your symptoms came on gradually suggests it's less likely to be a sudden event like surgery.\n\n**3. \u201cBrain Zaps\u201d (Brief Loss of Consciousness):**\n\n*   **Good you clarified this.** As you noted, \u201cbrain zaps\u201d are usually associated with medication withdrawal. What you\u2019re experiencing sounds different and ties in more with the seizures.  That brief loss of consciousness while standing up *could* very well be related to the seizures.\n*   **Important to tell the neurologist:**  Be sure to *specifically* describe these episodes to the neurologist.  Quantify them if possible (how often, how long do they last?).\n\n\n\n**Regarding feeling like you're going insane...**\n\nYou're not. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when medical issues are complex and don\u2019t have easy answers.  It's *especially* true when your symptoms are the kinds that are"

        "question": "Age:18 Sex:F Weight:46 kg Height:1.61 cm So i have had histories of deja vu, it usually doesn\u2019t last long. I don\u2019t have them a lot, sometimes more sometime less. I have a huge fear of brain tumor/epilepsy so i am always looking out for symptoms. I also randomly get dream flashbacks. Sometimes at night, doesn\u2019t happen that often, i get like weird head/body vibrations/buzzing and then i try to go to sleep, i start having nonsense thoughts and i can\u2019t sleep. My ears are buzzing right now and so is my head. My heart sometimes gets on a higher rate and i wake up from this mildly depersonalized. I fear that this mighr turn into a grand mal seizure. I have had no history of seizures before. I am so scared to sleep right now fearing that something might happen. It\u2019s probably about a year that this situation while i am trying to sleep happens. Wold really love to have an EEG bit when i went to the neurologist a year ago he only diagnosed me with anxiety combined with elements of OCD. He did some reflex/eyesight tests and all came back with no neurological deficit. I\u2019d get an EEG but i am literally such a hypochondriac that my parents are concerned and i just went through blood tests and i don\u2019t want to worry them again! If anyone has any idea i\u2019d be so glad :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're experiencing a lot of anxiety surrounding potential neurological issues, and a constellation of symptoms that are understandably frightening. Let's break this down. It's *very* good you've already seen a neurologist, even if you're not feeling completely reassured.  I'm going to try to address your concerns systematically, but **please read the disclaimer at the end of this response. I cannot provide medical diagnoses.**\n\n**Let's address your symptoms one by one, and then consider the overall picture:**\n\n* **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu:**  Occasional, short-lived d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is *extremely* common, especially in young adults. It's often linked to minor anomalies in brain processing, but it doesn't usually indicate a problem.  It can be triggered by stress, fatigue, or even just being in a new or complex environment.\n* **Dream Flashbacks:** These also aren't uncommon.  Sometimes these are remnants of very vivid dreams, or brief intrusions of memory.\n* **Head/Body Vibrations & Buzzing (Hypnic Jerks/Sensory Disturbances):** This is the most concerning part of your description, but importantly, it's also very frequently connected to anxiety and sleep. What you are describing sounds a lot like *hypnic jerks* or *hypnagogic hallucinations*. These are very common experiences when falling asleep.  The buzzing, vibrations, and sometimes even quick, jerky movements are your nervous system 'winding down' and transitioning into sleep.  The nonsense thoughts often accompany this as your brain shifts from wakefulness to sleep. They can be disturbing, but are generally benign.\n* **Ear Buzzing (Tinnitus) & Head Buzzing:** These can happen independently, connected to stress, dehydration, or even just normal auditory processing.  However, *together* with your other symptoms, it's understandable why you're worried.\n* **Heart Rate Increase & Mild Depersonalization:** Again, anxiety is a prime suspect here.  When anxious, your heart rate speeds up (palpitations), and depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself or reality) is a very common anxiety symptom. It's a natural \"fight or flight\" response.\n* **Fear of Seizures/Grand Mal:** This is clearly driving a lot of your anxiety.  While it's good to be aware of potential symptoms, the constant fear is extremely detrimental to your well-being.  The absence of a history of seizures and the normal neurological exam a year ago are *very* reassuring.\n\n**The Big Picture & Why Anxiety is Likely a Major Factor:**\n\nYou've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD.  This is significant.  What you're describing aligns very well with heightened anxiety and health anxiety (hypochondria).  *Health anxiety often manifests as focusing on bodily sensations and interpreting them as signs of serious illness*.  This creates a vicious cycle:\n\n1. **Physical Sensation (e.g., buzzing, heart rate increase):** This could be a totally normal occurrence.\n2. **Anxious Thought (e.g., \"This is a sign of a tumor/seizure\"):** Your anxiety latches onto the sensation.\n3. **Increased Anxiety:**  The anxious thought increases your anxiety levels.\n4. **More Physical Symptoms:**  Increased anxiety leads to *more* physical symptoms (faster heart rate, depersonalization, etc.).\n5. **Cycle Repeats:**  This creates a reinforcing loop.\n\n\n\n**Regarding Your Concerns about an EEG:**\n\nYou're right to be sensitive to your parents' concerns about repeated medical investigation.  You have had a neurological evaluation that *didn\u2019t* find evidence of a neurological problem. An EEG *might* provide some reassurance, but:\n\n*   **EEGs aren't always definitive.** A normal EEG doesn't completely rule out everything, and an abnormal EEG *doesn't* necessarily mean you have a condition causing problems.\n*   **False positives and false negatives can occur.**\n*   **The anxiety *around* the test might be more harmful than the test itself.**\n\n**What to Do Now (Focus on managing Anxiety):**\n\n1.  **Therapy:**  This is the most important step.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is *highly* effective for anxiety and OCD.  CBT helps you identify and challenge anxious thought patterns, and develop coping mechanisms.  Specifically, look for a therapist familiar with health anxiety.\n2.  **Relaxation Techniques:**  Practice deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness. These can help calm your nervous system when you start to feel anxious.\n3.  **Sleep Hygiene:**  This is crucial. Create a relaxing bedtime routine.  Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.  Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.  Consider a warm bath before bed.\n4.  **Limit \"Dr. Google\":** I know it's tempting, but constantly researching symptoms will *fuel* your anxiety.\n5.  **Talk to Your Parents:** Explain what you\u2019re experiencing and the impact it is having on your quality of life.  They may be more supportive than you fear if you can articulate your struggles.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention (Again):**\n\nWhile it\u2019s good to manage your anxiety, it\u2019s also important to be aware of red flags. *If* you experience any of the following, *then* it's appropriate to revisit your doctor:\n\n*   **A first-time seizure:** characterized by loss of awareness, stiffening of the body, uncontrolled jerking movements.\n*   **New neurological symptoms:**  Weakness, numbness, severe headache, vision changes, speech difficulties, significant memory problems.\n*   **Worsening symptoms:** If your current symptoms intensify dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3\u2019s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, deep breaths. You're dealing with *a lot*, and it's infuriating that you're being dismissed and gaslit by a doctor, especially with your complex medical history. You are advocating for yourself, and that's incredibly important. Here's a breakdown of advice, categorized for clarity, addressing your concerns.  I will also include a **disclaimer at the end** as I am not a medical professional.\n\n**1. Addressing the Immediate Pain & Rule Out Torsion (Priority #1)**\n\n* **Push for Imaging:**  The ER was uncertain about torsion, and your pain sounds concerning for it.  The CT scan is good to rule out diverticulitis, but it's *not* the best imaging to definitively rule out ovarian torsion.  You need another **Ultrasound, preferably transvaginal**, done ASAP. Explain specifically to the radiologist that you're concerned about torsion despite the previous inconclusive findings. Advocate (or have someone advocate *for* you) for a focused pelvic ultrasound.  Torsion can sometimes happen intermittently, and a scan could be normal *between* episodes of twisting.\n* **Don't Accept Dismissal:** Your doctor\u2019s statement is unacceptable and frankly, dangerous. It's incredibly frustrating and shows a lack of respect.  You have a right to be heard and to explore all possible causes of your pain.\n* **Consider a Different ER:** If possible, if the pain escalated aggressively again, go to a different ER. A different doctor *might* be more receptive to your concerns.  Be prepared with a concise summary of your history and your specific worries about torsion.\n* **Pain Management (Temporary, while investigating torsion):** You're right to be wary of relying on opioids. Since you've been given T3s (codeine/acetaminophen), use them *very sparingly* and only if absolutely necessary to function while awaiting further assessment. Given your epilepsy risk (more on that below), minimize any medication that could lower your seizure threshold.  Zofran is helping with nausea, which is good, as that's a common torsion symptom, but it can mask things so you need to be extra vigilant about other symptoms. Toradol (ketorolac) is an NSAID and can potentially interact with your keppra - consult with a pharmacist.\n\n**2. Managing Epilepsy Considerations**\n\n* **Pain & Seizure Threshold:** You\u2019re smart to be concerned about pain lowering your seizure threshold.  Severe pain *can* increase the risk of seizures.  \n* **Medication Interactions:** *Critically important*:  You are on Keppra and Lamotrigine.  Both are crucial for seizure control.  \n    * **Codeine (T3s):**  Can *potentially* lower the seizure threshold. Use with extreme caution and as little as possible.\n    * **Toradol (Ketorolac):** NSAIDs *can* interact with Keppra, potentially altering its levels.  Talk to a pharmacist immediately about this.\n    * **Zofran (Ondansetron):** Generally considered relatively safe with Keppra and Lamotrigine, but always good to double-check.\n* **Document Pain & Seizure Activity:** Keep a log of your pain levels, any new symptoms, and if you feel any pre-seizure auras or changes in your usual seizure pattern. This information will be invaluable for your surgeon and neurologist.\n\n**3. Addressing the Doctor\u2019s Behavior & Future Care**\n\n* **Formal Complaint:** Seriously consider filing a formal complaint about the doctor's behavior.  This isn\u2019t just about you; it's about preventing this from happening to other patients.  Contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (or whichever provincial body governs doctors in your location).\n* **Surgeon First:** Your excision specialist is your best bet.  Definitely contact their office first thing tomorrow. Explain the situation and your concerns about torsion.  They may be able to expedite a scan or offer advice.\n* **Document Everything:**  Keep a detailed record of all medical interactions, including dates, times, what was said, and any medications prescribed.\n* **Communication is Key:** When you speak to your surgeon, *clearly* state:\n    * Your specific pain details (location, character, radiation, triggers, relieving factors)\n    * Your concern about ovarian torsion.\n    * Your epilepsy and the importance of avoiding medications that could lower your seizure threshold.\n    * Your desire to avoid long-term opioid use.\n\n**4. Dealing with the Waiting Period & Your Mental Health**\n\n* **Pelvic Floor Physio (Eventually):**  Once you get the acute pain under control, resuming pelvic floor physiotherapy is a great idea, especially post-surgery.\n* **Gluten-Free:** Continue with the gluten-free diet if it helps. Investigating celiac disease is a good idea \u2013 ask your family doctor (when they're back) for a referral.\n* **Self-Care:** This is exhausting.  Prioritize rest, gentle movement (if tolerated), and things that bring you joy, even in small doses.\n* **Support System:** Lean on friends and family for emotional support.  Consider joining an online support group for people with endometriosis, PCOS, or epilepsy.\n* **Mental Health:** The dismissal you experienced will likely have impacted your mental health - consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor if you are able.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really frustrating situation, and it's understandable why you're feeling knocked down. Unexplained onset of seizures in adulthood, *especially* with normal imaging, is a tough diagnostic puzzle.  Here's a breakdown of thoughts, potential avenues, and things you might want to discuss with your neurologist, categorized for clarity.  I will preface this with a **very strong disclaimer**: *I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and should not substitute a consultation with your medical team.*\n\n**I. Understanding the Challenges of Your Case (Why it's hard to diagnose)**\n\n* **Normal Imaging:** The fact that your CT and MRI are normal is both reassuring (ruling out structural brain issues like tumors, malformations) and frustrating. It significantly narrows down the possibilities, but doesn\u2019t eliminate them.  A 'normal' MRI doesn't mean there's absolutely nothing going on neurologically \u2013 subtle issues can be missed.\n* **Normal EEG:**  A normal EEG doesn't rule out seizures, especially if the seizures are infrequent.  EEGs capture brain activity *during* the test.  If the seizure activity doesn\u2019t happen while you\u2019re hooked up, it won\u2019t be detected. Interictal (between seizure) EEGs can sometimes show subtle abnormalities, but often they are absent.\n* **Late-Onset Seizures:**  New-onset seizures in adulthood are more complex to diagnose than childhood epilepsy. Potential causes change with age.\n* **Partial Seizures Progressing to Grand Mal:** This progression is concerning and adds another layer of complexity. It suggests increased seizure propensity or a changing seizure pattern.\n\n\n\n**II. Potential Causes to Explore (with your Doctor)**\n\nThis is broken down into categories.  I'll try to be comprehensive.\n\n* **Epilepsy \u2013 Even without a Clear Cause:**  Sometimes epilepsy *is* idiopathic (meaning we don't know the cause). This is frustrating, but it's a possible diagnosis. The Keppra is appropriate to manage symptoms even if the underlying reason isn't pinpointed. Discuss the likelihood your neurologist assigns to this.\n* **Medication-Related (This is important given your list):**\n    * **Adderall:**  While less common, Adderall can *lower* the seizure threshold in some individuals, meaning it makes seizures more likely.  Even though you take it \u201cas needed,\u201d the timing around your seizures should be carefully reviewed.  Your doctor might want to trial stopping Adderall, even temporarily, to see if seizure frequency changes.\n    * **Zoloft (Sertraline):**  SSRIs like Zoloft, while generally safe, can *very rarely* lower the seizure threshold. This is less common than with Adderall, but it needs to be considered.\n    * **Drug Interactions:** The combination of your medications, vape, and weed needs careful evaluation for potential interactions that could lower seizure threshold. *Be honest with your doctor about your substance use, even if you're concerned about judgment.*  They need the full picture.\n* **Underlying Medical Conditions (Beyond what you've mentioned):**\n    * **Autoimmune Disorders:** Some autoimmune conditions can affect the brain and cause seizures.  It might be worth discussing a basic autoimmune panel with your doctor.\n    * **Celiac Disease/Gluten Sensitivity:**  There's a link between undiagnosed celiac disease and neurological symptoms, including seizures.  A blood test can screen for this.\n    * **Vascular Issues:**  Even though your CT was normal, subtle vascular abnormalities (small vessel disease) might not be immediately apparent.\n    * **Metabolic Disorders:**  Rare metabolic conditions can present with seizures in adulthood.\n* **Non-Neurological Triggers:**\n    * **Stress & Sleep Deprivation:**  Especially given your anxiety and depression, significant stress and inadequate sleep can be triggers. You mentioned you're a student, so this is very relevant.\n    * **Hormonal Fluctuations:** Changes in your menstrual cycle *could* potentially play a role.  Keeping a detailed log of seizures in relation to your cycle might be helpful.\n    * **Photosensitivity:**  Flashing lights or patterns can trigger seizures in some people. While this is more common in childhood epilepsy, it\u2019s worth considering.\n\n**III.  Further Diagnostic Tests to Discuss**\n\n* **Prolonged EEG Monitoring:** Consider a longer EEG (24-72 hours, or even an ambulatory EEG) to increase the chances of capturing a seizure event.  Video-EEG monitoring (where you\u2019re recorded during the EEG) is even better, as it allows doctors to correlate the brain activity with your observed behavior during a seizure.\n* **Metabolic Blood Tests:** A comprehensive metabolic panel to rule out electrolyte imbalances or other metabolic abnormalities.\n* **Autoimmune Panel:**  Tests for common autoimmune antibodies.\n* **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):**  This is more invasive, but it can help rule out inflammation or infection in the brain and spinal cord.  Your neurologist will determine if it\u2019s necessary.\n* **Functional MRI (fMRI):** While expensive and not always available, fMRI can sometimes identify subtle brain network abnormalities that aren't visible on standard MRI.\n\n\n\n\n**IV.  Things to do *Now* (Beyond Medical Investigation)**\n\n* **Seizure Diary:**  Meticulously track every seizure: date, time, duration, symptoms (what did you *feel* before, during, and after?), possible triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, food, time of menstrual cycle, etc.). \n* **Lifestyle Optimization:** Prioritize sleep, manage stress (therapy, mindfulness, relaxation techniques), eat a healthy diet, and stay hydrated.\n* **Safety Precautions:**  You\u2019re already aware of the driving restriction \u2013 that\u2019s good.  Be careful around water, heights, and operating machinery. Consider a medical alert bracelet.\n* **Support System:**  Talk to your friends and family about your seizures.  Let them know what to do if they witness one.\n\n\n\n\n**V.  Important Questions to Ask Your Neurologist**\n\n* \"What is your leading hypothesis about the cause of my seizures, given the normal results of my tests?\"\n* \"What is the next step in the diagnostic process?\"\n* \"What are the potential risks and benefits of continuing Keppra? Are there other medications we should consider?\"\n* \"Could my Adderall or Zoloft be contributing to my seizures?\"\n* \"Should I consider any other specialists (e.g., rheumatologist, endocrinologist)?\"\n* \"What are the criteria for considering this 'unexplained' epilepsy, and what does that mean for my long-term management?\"\n\n\n\n**Regarding your feeling of being \"knocked on your ass\":**  That's absolutely valid.  Living with uncertainty is incredibly stressful.  Don\u2019t hesitate to lean on your therapist (given your MDD and GAD) for support in coping with this challenging diagnosis.\n\n\n\n**Final Note:**  This is a complex situation. Don\u2019t be afraid to advocate for yourself, ask questions, and seek a second opinion if you feel your concerns aren't being adequately addressed.  Finding the right answers may take time and persistence.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful.  Please remember to discuss all of this with your doctor.  Good luck!"

        "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation and understandably causing you a lot of worry. You're doing the right thing by gathering information and trying to understand what's going on. Let's break down the issues, address your questions, and discuss what might be happening.  I will provide information, but this *is not a substitute for medical advice*. Your father needs to be under the close care of his medical team, and ideally, you can be involved in discussions with them (with his consent, of course).\n\n**1. Is it possible going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return?**\n\n**Yes, it's highly possible.**  This is the most concerning piece of the puzzle. Even though your father feels \"relatively intact\" cognitively, that doesn't mean hepatic encephalopathy (HE) isn't playing a role, and *subtle* changes in HE can absolutely trigger seizures. \n\n* **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and Seizures:** HE isn't just about dramatic confusion.  It exists on a spectrum.  Subclinical HE (where the changes are subtle and not easily noticed) can be enough to lower the seizure threshold.  Xifaxan (rifaximin) works by reducing the amount of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut. Ammonia is a key neurotoxin involved in HE.  When Xifaxan is stopped, ammonia levels can rise, even if it doesn't immediately manifest as overt confusion.  This increase in ammonia can destabilize brain function and trigger seizures in someone with cirrhosis.\n* **The fact that the seizures started soon after stopping Xifaxan is very suggestive.**  It's a strong temporal relationship that needs to be investigated.  The fact that he *feels* okay doesn\u2019t negate the physiological impact.\n* **Rare Side Effect is Still a Possibility:** You are right, seizures aren't a *common* side effect of HE, but they are a documented possibility, especially when HE is poorly controlled.\n\n**2. Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy?**\n\n**Absolutely.**  As explained above, a rise in ammonia due to HE can disrupt normal brain function leading to seizures. It is important to note that your father's previous history of esophageal varices also increases the risk of seizures due to potential subtle brain damage from episodes of bleeding.\n\n**3.  The Motorbike Accident & Salt Tablets**\n\n* **Motorbike Accident:** While a past head injury *could* potentially contribute to a lower seizure threshold, given the timing of the seizures relative to stopping Xifaxan, it's less likely to be the primary cause *now*.  It's good he's considered it, but it's likely a less important factor than the HE.\n* **Salt Tablets:** It's good his GP advised him to stop.  Low sodium can sometimes be associated with HE, but too much sodium can exacerbate fluid retention, which is *very* common with cirrhosis and can worsen ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and varices.\n\n\n\n**4.  Your Father's Choice & What You Can Do (This is a hard one)**\n\nYou're right. You can't force him to take medication. He's an adult, and has the right to make his own choices, even if they are choices you disagree with. This is incredibly frustrating. Here's what you **can** focus on:\n\n* **Communication:**  Continue talking to him.  You've already started by asking him to weigh the options (seizures vs. frequent bathroom trips).  Frame it in terms of *quality of life*.  \"Dad, I understand you don't like going to the bathroom a lot, but seizures are really dangerous.  We\u2019re worried they'll get worse and could lead to\u2026\u201d (You might need to gently explain the potential consequences without being overly alarmist).\n* **Focus on the *Impact* on You:** Instead of telling him what *he* should do, express how his choices *affect you*.  \"Dad, when you have a seizure, it scares me terribly.  It's incredibly hard on me to see you go through that.\" This is less confrontational.\n* **Present the Doctor's Concerns (if he'll let you):**  \"The doctor is concerned that stopping the Xifaxan might be contributing to the seizures. Maybe we can ask the doctor to explain it to both of us?\" (Again, this relies on his willingness to include you). Bringing a list of questions to the doctor's appointments may be helpful.\n* **Support, Not Control:** Ultimately, you can offer support, ensure he attends medical appointments, and advocate for his care, but you can't make him comply.\n\n**5.  The fMRI Scan and Why It's Important**\n\nThe fMRI is a good step. It's trying to identify any structural changes *within* the brain that might be contributing to the seizures.  However, it won\u2019t necessarily detect subtle changes caused by HE.  The scan will help rule out other causes, like a tumor or stroke.\n\n**6.  Your Concern About Increasing Frequency & Coma/Death**\n\nYour fears are valid.  Uncontrolled seizures can lead to status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure or a series of seizures without regaining consciousness), which is a medical emergency and can cause brain damage and death, especially in someone with underlying liver disease.  The worsening frequency *is* a red flag.\n\n**7. Medication Review**\n\n*   **Propranolol:**  Used to lower blood pressure and prevent variceal bleeding. Important to continue.\n*   **Pantoprazole:**  PPI for acid reflux.  Common in people with liver disease, as varices can cause esophageal irritation.\n*   **Lansoprazole:**  Another PPI. Likely used to prevent acid reflux and protect the esophagus.\n*   **Spiractin (Spironolactone):** A diuretic, used to help manage ascites (fluid build-up in the abdomen).\n*   **Mirtazapine:** An antidepressant.  Can be helpful for mood in chronic illness, but also may have interactions with liver function.\n\n\n\n**What Needs to Happen *Now***\n\n1.  **Urgent Physician Communication:**  The most important thing is for your father to IMMEDIATELY contact his doctor (hepatologist or gastroenterologist) regarding the seizure recurrence after stopping Xifaxan.  They need to reassess his HE status, likely with blood tests (ammonia levels, liver function tests), and potentially repeat cognitive testing.\n2.  **Consider Re-Starting Xifaxan:** Based on the evidence, the doctor should strongly recommend restarting Xifaxan.\n3.  **Seizure Management:**  Keppra is a reasonable choice for acute seizure control.  However, addressing the underlying cause (potentially HE) is paramount.\n4. **Careful Medication Review:** Discuss the current medication list with the doctor to ensure no adverse drug interactions.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **American Liver Foundation:** [https://liverfoundation.org/](https://liverfoundation.org/)\n*   **National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA):** [https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/)\n\n\n\nI know this is a lot of information.  You're in a tough spot.  Focus on being a supportive son, advocating for his medical care (as much as he allows), and taking care of *yourself* throughout this process.  It's okay to feel overwhelmed and seek support for yourself as well.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "19F 167cm 59kg chinese in UK // \"passing out\" under certain conditions, suspected focal epilepsy?? duration: 3+ years?? (no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds concerning and needs proper medical evaluation. You're right to be proactive, even with the delay in seeing a GP. Your description strongly suggests a possibility of a neurological issue, and focal epilepsy is a reasonable consideration, but *it's crucial not to self-diagnose.*  There are other possibilities too, and a proper diagnosis requires investigation. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what's going on, why your observations are important, what could be happening, and importantly, what you can do *now* while you wait for a GP appointment in October.  I will emphasize at the end to see a doctor as soon as possible, even if that means finding a way to see someone sooner.\n\n**Why Your Observations Are Important:**\n\n* **Trigger:** The consistent association with bright lights/screens in dim environments is *very* important. This strongly suggests a photosensitive trigger.  Photosensitivity is common in some types of epilepsy, but also other conditions.\n* **Prodrome (warning signs):**  Dizziness and nausea *before* the event are a prodrome. Recognizing these can be helpful.\n* **Eye Rolling & Loss of Focus:** This is a key symptom.  It suggests a disruption of normal brain activity.\n* **Brief Unconsciousness & Post-ictal State:** Losing consciousness, even for seconds, is significant. The disorientation afterward (\"post-ictal state\") is also typical of seizures or similar events.  The repeated \u201cpassing out\u201d immediately after regaining consciousness is also suggestive of continued neurological disturbance.\n* **Latency (delay before event):**  The several minutes it takes for the effect to occur is also important information.  This suggests something is building up, rather than an immediate reaction.\n* **Duration:**  The 3+ years duration means this isn\u2019t a one-off event, solidifying the need for investigation.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes (and it\u2019s NOT just epilepsy):**\n\n* **Focal Epilepsy:** This is a strong possibility, *especially* with the visual trigger and focal symptoms (eye rolling, altered awareness). Focal seizures start in one area of the brain and can manifest in various ways, including visual disturbances and loss of consciousness. Photosensitive epilepsy is a sub-type.\n* **Photosensitive Epilepsy:**  Specifically, the flashes and patterns in bright lights can trigger seizures.  However, not all photosensitive epilepsy presents the same way, and it's often (but not always) associated with specific frequencies of flashing light.\n* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position, which *could* contribute to dizziness, but doesn\u2019t explain the eye rolling or prolonged loss of consciousness as well.  It's less likely given the light/screen trigger.\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:**  This is a common cause of fainting, triggered by things like stress, pain, or prolonged standing.  Again, the trigger and eye rolling make this less likely as the primary cause.\n* **Migraine with Aura:**  Some migraines have visual auras that can cause temporary vision loss or disturbances. In rare cases, this can lead to loss of consciousness.\n* **Cardiac Arrhythmia:** Very rare in someone your age with no known heart conditions, but a brief arrhythmia could theoretically cause a drop in blood flow to the brain.  (This is less likely given the consistent trigger.)\n* **Transient Global Amnesia:** This is usually a more complete memory loss that lasts for hours, but brief similar events are possible.  \n\n\n\n\n**What YOU can do *now* (While waiting for the GP):**\n\n1. **Detailed Diary:**  This is *crucial*.  Keep a meticulous record of *every* episode.  Include:\n    * **Date and Time:**\n    * **Exact circumstances:**  Where were you?  What were you looking at (specific screen type, lighting levels, colours?) What were you doing *before* the episode? (e.g. studying, driving, etc.)  How long were you exposed to the stimulus before it started?\n    * **Prodromal symptoms:**  What did you feel *before* it happened? (dizziness, nausea, headache, anxiety, etc.)\n    * **What happened during the event:**  Describe *exactly* what you experienced \u2013 eye rolling, loss of focus, how long you were unconscious, any movements (jerking, twitching, etc.).  If possible, have someone observe you during an episode and describe it.\n    * **Post-ictal symptoms:** How did you feel *after* regaining consciousness (confused, sleepy, headache, etc.) and how long did these feelings last?\n    * **Duration of each episode.**\n2. **Avoid Triggers (If Possible):** If you can, minimize exposure to situations that seem to trigger these events.  This is hard with university life, but try to:\n    *  Avoid prolonged use of screens in very dark rooms.\n    *  Dim the brightness of your screens.\n    *  If you *must* be in a dimly lit environment with a bright screen (e.g., concert), try to look away from the screen periodically.\n    *  When driving at night, attempt to avoid directly staring at bright headlights.\n3. **Hydration & Sleep:** Ensure you're adequately hydrated and getting enough sleep.  These are general health principles that can help prevent many types of episodes.\n4. **Consider a Video Recording (Difficult, but potentially helpful):** If you have a trusted friend or family member who is with you frequently, *and* if you feel comfortable, ask them to try to record a short video of an episode (from a safe distance) if they see it happening. This would be invaluable for a doctor.  **Do not put yourself or others in danger trying to record!**\n5. **Inform Someone:**  Make sure someone (a friend, roommate, family member) knows about this and what to do if they see you having an episode.  They should know to ensure you are in a safe location and to time the duration.\n6. **Travel Considerations:** Given the possibility of seizures, you should *seriously* consider the risks of travelling alone further.  If possible, postpone non-essential travel until you\u2019ve been evaluated.\n\n\n**Important - See a Doctor ASAP!**\n\nOctober is a *long* time to wait with these symptoms. While I understand your personal reasons for waiting, *please* explore options for getting seen sooner. Here are some suggestions:\n\n* **University Health Services:** Even if you're traveling for the summer, your university might have a process for getting a referral to a specialist or getting advice remotely.\n* **NHS 111 (UK):** This is a non-emergency medical helpline. Explain your symptoms and they can advise you on the best course of action.  They might be able to connect you with a local service.  Dial 111.\n* **Private Consultation (Expensive, but fast):** If you can afford it, a private consultation with a neurologist would be the quickest way to get a diagnosis and treatment plan.\n* **Emergency Department (If Symptoms Worsen):** If your symptoms become more frequent, severe, or prolonged, or if you injure yourself during an episode, go to the nearest Emergency Department (A&E).\n\n**What to tell your GP:**\n\nWhen you do see the GP in October, be prepared to:\n\n*   Provide the detailed diary you've been keeping.\n*   Clearly articulate your symptoms and concerns.\n*   Emphasize the trigger (bright lights/screens in dim environments).\n*   Ask about a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation (EEG is the most common first step to diagnose epilepsy).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

Let me know if you have any further questions, although I will always reiterate that I cannot provide medical advice."

        "question": "Male 6months old no medical conditions, no medicine being taken. Approx 20lbs healthy baby boyMy son was sleeping and woke up screaming I went to soothe him and he couldn\u2019t be consoled for what seemed like forever. I tried waking him up from what seemed like a nightmare but he wouldn\u2019t wake finally he woke up and stopped screaming. He became unresponsive but with eyes open. He looked lethargic and wouldn\u2019t respond to stimulation. Then shook a little bit 3 times and went back to normal. Was this a seizure? Should I take him to the hospital or have his doctor look into it at his physical?Thank you for any responseUpdate: baby went to the doctor today they will be doing an EEG to be on the safe side.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly frightening, and I completely understand your worry. What you described *could* be a seizure, specifically a type called an infantile spasm or a more subtle focal seizure, but it's impossible for me (as an AI) to diagnose. The sequence of events \u2013 the inconsolable crying, unresponsiveness with eyes open, shaking, and return to normal \u2013 definitely raises red flags.  The fact that it followed waking from sleep is also something doctors will want to know.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why your concern is valid, and why the doctor is doing the right thing with the EEG:**\n\n* **Infantile Spasms:** These can present as sudden stiffening, jerking, or head nods, sometimes accompanied by crying.  They often happen when waking up or drowsy.  Even though your description doesn't perfectly fit the classic picture, they can be variable. They are a specific type of seizure that often requires specialized treatment.\n* **Focal Seizures:** These can be more subtle and might involve a period of altered awareness (unresponsiveness) and potentially twitching or jerking. They can sometimes be mistaken for staring spells, but the associated crying and shaking make this less likely in this case.\n* **Post-ictal State:** The period *after* a seizure (the lethargy and unresponsiveness you observed) is called the post-ictal state.  Babies often sleep or are very quiet and difficult to arouse after a seizure.\n* **Benign Myoclonus of Infancy:** This *can* involve jerking movements, but it\u2019s typically not preceded by a distressed cry and not associated with unresponsiveness. It's less likely given the full picture.\n\n**Regarding your initial question about the hospital vs. the doctor's appointment:**\n\nYou were right to be concerned.  Given the symptoms, an immediate trip to the emergency room *wouldn\u2019t have been unreasonable* to rule out something serious. However, since you were able to get a prompt appointment with your pediatrician and they are taking it seriously with an EEG, that's a very good course of action.  The EEG (electroencephalogram) is the best way to look for abnormal brain activity that can confirm or rule out seizures.\n\n\n\n**Update - Excellent!**\n\nThe fact that your doctor is ordering an EEG is *exactly* what you want. This is the standard next step in investigating potential seizures in an infant.  It's a safe and non-invasive test.\n\n**What to expect with the EEG:**\n\n* **Preparation:**  They will likely need to measure your baby\u2019s head and will apply small electrodes to his scalp using a special paste.  It\u2019s usually painless, but can be a little messy and some babies don't like having things on their head.\n* **During the Test:** The EEG records brain waves.  They may have your baby sleep during part of the test, and they may also briefly flash a strobe light (they will take precautions to protect his eyes).\n* **After the Test:** You\u2019ll be able to remove the paste and go home.  It can take a while for the results to be interpreted by a neurologist.\n\n**What you can do now:**\n\n* **Video Record if Possible:** If you are still concerned about repeat events, try to video record them (if it is safe to do so, and doesn\u2019t delay you from comforting your baby).  Even a short video can be extremely helpful for the doctor.\n* **Keep a Detailed Log:** Write down the date and time of the event, what your baby was doing before it happened (sleeping, awake, feeding, etc.), exactly what you observed (crying, unresponsiveness, shaking \u2013 document what parts of the body were affected, how long it lasted), and how long it took him to recover.\n* **Follow Up:** Be sure to follow up with your doctor as scheduled to discuss the EEG results.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your doctor is the best source of information for your baby's specific situation.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and I truly hope the EEG comes back clear and provides you with peace of mind. It\u2019s so stressful when something like this happens, so remember to take care of yourself as well."

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation and I appreciate the detailed history. You're understandably frustrated and your concerns are valid. It sounds like you've been very proactive in trying to manage this, and the fact that keto worked initially adds another layer to the puzzle. Here's a breakdown of thoughts, potential explanations, and recommendations, broken down into sections. **Please read the disclaimer at the end. This is *not* a substitute for in-person medical advice.**\n\n**1. Understanding the Puzzle: What's Going On?**\n\n* **Antibiotic/PPI Link:** The timing of your symptom return *immediately* after the H. pylori treatment is highly significant.  Antibiotics disrupt gut flora, and PPIs (like Prilosec) impact gut acid levels. This can have a huge impact on neurological health through the gut-brain axis. This isn\u2019t just \u201ccoincidence.\u201d  The gut microbiome produces neurotransmitters and influences inflammation, both of which can affect seizure thresholds.\n* **Refractory Epilepsy:** The fact that oxcarbazepine, which previously controlled your symptoms perfectly, stopped working is concerning. This is often called \"refractory epilepsy\" - epilepsy that doesn\u2019t respond to the first-line treatments. It suggests a change in the underlying mechanism of your symptoms.\n* **Diet-Induced Variability:** The clear connection between carbohydrate intake/ketosis and your symptoms is extremely important.  This points towards a metabolic component.  Ketogenic diets are known to have anticonvulsant effects (historically used for epilepsy treatment), but your experience is demonstrating that it's not a perfect solution.  The fact that deviating from keto brings things back with a vengeance suggests a very sensitive system.\n* **Not Necessarily *Classic* Epilepsy:** While your initial diagnosis was epilepsy, the complexity of your case \u2013 the antibiotic trigger, the diet sensitivity, the failed medication \u2013 makes me wonder if a broader neurological assessment is warranted.  Your symptoms *could* be atypical seizures, but could also represent a different neurological condition influenced by gut and metabolic factors.  (See section 5 about differentials)\n\n\n\n**2. Why Oxcarbazepine May Have Stopped Working**\n\nThere are several possibilities:\n\n* **Tolerance:** While less common with oxcarbazepine than some other medications, tolerance can develop over very long periods.  However, two years off shouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to complete lack of efficacy.\n* **Pharmacokinetic Changes:**  The H. pylori treatment *could* have subtly altered your liver function or intestinal absorption, affecting how you metabolize and absorb the medication.\n* **Disease Progression/Change:** The underlying neurological issue might have evolved in nature, becoming less responsive to your initial treatment.\n* **Gut-Brain Axis Influence:** The gut disruption may be fundamentally altering brain excitability, overwhelming the medication\u2019s effect.\n\n**3. What Needs to Be Investigated Further?**\n\n* **Detailed Neurological Re-evaluation:** This NEEDS to happen.  I'd recommend seeing a neurologist specializing in epilepsy (an epileptologist).  They may recommend:\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** Even if you haven't had a classic seizure, an EEG *during* an episode of the \"feeling\" is crucial.  This will help determine if there's abnormal brain activity.  Extended EEG monitoring (e.g., ambulatory EEG over 24-72 hours) might be needed to capture infrequent events.\n    * **MRI of the Brain:**  To rule out any structural abnormalities.  An MRI *with* epilepsy protocol (specific sequences) is important.\n    * **Neuropsychological Testing:**  To assess cognitive function, which can be affected by these types of neurological events.\n* **Gut Health Assessment:**\n    * **Stool Analysis:**  Comprehensive stool testing to assess the diversity and balance of your gut microbiome.\n    * **SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) Testing:** Common after antibiotic use and can contribute to neurological symptoms.\n    * **Food Sensitivity Testing:** While not definitive, it could help identify further dietary triggers beyond just sugar/carbs.\n* **Metabolic Panel:** Repeating a complete metabolic panel to assess liver and kidney function and ensure things are within normal ranges. This is especially important to see if the antibiotics had an impact.\n* **Vitamin/Mineral Levels:**  Assessment of Vitamin D, B vitamins, Magnesium, and other nutrients critical for neurological health.\n\n\n\n**4. What About Treatment? (Beyond Keto)**\n\nYou\u2019re right to feel frustrated with the current situation.  Here\u2019s a phased approach:\n\n* **Phase 1 (Immediate): Optimize Gut Health:**\n    * **Probiotic & Prebiotic Supplementation:**  Under the guidance of a doctor or registered dietitian. Selecting the right strains is key.\n    * **Low-FODMAP Diet (Temporary):**  Under guidance - this can help reduce gut inflammation.  It's not a long-term solution, but can provide temporary relief.\n    * **Consider Digestive Enzymes:** To aid digestion.\n* **Phase 2 (Alongside Neurological Evaluation): Medication Re-Evaluation:**\n    * **Different Antiepileptic Drug (AED):** If the EEG confirms seizure activity, you *absolutely* need to consider trying another AED.  There are many options (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, topiramate, etc.).  Each has its own side effect profile. Your neurologist will help you weigh the risks and benefits. Don't dismiss this because of potential side effects - the current level of limitation is significant.\n    * **Adjunctive Therapy:**  Sometimes, combining medications can be more effective.\n* **Phase 3 (Long-Term Maintenance):**\n    * **Strict Carbohydrate Control:** Even if another AED is found, it's likely you'll need to continue a low-carb diet to a degree, although maybe not as restrictive as full keto.\n    * **Stress Management:**  Stress can be a trigger for neurological symptoms.  Mindfulness, meditation, or other stress-reducing techniques can be helpful.\n    * **Regular Exercise:** Helps with overall health and can have a positive effect on neurological function.\n\n\n\n**5. Differential Diagnoses (Things it Might Not Be)**\n\nBecause your presentation is atypical, these should be considered:\n\n* **PNES (Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures):** These are events that *look* like seizures but are caused by psychological distress. They can be triggered by stress or trauma. The EEG is typically normal during these events. NB: this doesn't mean it's \"all in your head\" - it's a neurological condition resulting from psychological factors.\n* **Movement Disorder:** There are other movement disorders (dystonia, myoclonus) that can cause jerky movements, and can sometimes be triggered by dietary changes.\n* **Migraine with Aura:** While you don\u2019t mention headaches, some migraine variants can cause neurological symptoms without significant head pain.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  The suggestions above are broad recommendations and must be tailored to your specific situation by a physician.\n\n\n\n**To help me provide more targeted advice, could you tell me:**\n\n*   **Have you kept a detailed symptom diary, specifically noting what you eat, time of day, and the nature of the \"feelings?\"**\n* **Can you describe the \u201cjerking\u201d more precisely? Is it a twitch, a pull, a full-body spasm?**\n* **What specifically do you mean by \"feeling like you have to hold on to something?\"  Is it a feeling of imbalance, weakness, or something else?**\n*   **Have you had any psychological stressors recently (even seemingly small ones)?**\n\n\n\nI truly hope this helps.  I know this is a lot, but you deserve a thorough evaluation and a plan to get your life back on track.  Don't give up on finding answers."

        "question": "I took my epilepsy meds about 1.5h ago, Divalproex Sodium 250mg. I want to take a regular Gravol (not nighttime) so I can get to sleep earlier. I know it's not the best sleep aid but I don't have anything else at home currently and I want to fix my awful schedule.I read something about diphenhydramine triggering seizures but I'm not sure how similar it is to dimenhydrinate which is in Gravol so I'm a little worried as I haven't had one in years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good and responsible question to ask, and it's smart of you to be cautious given your epilepsy and medication.  You're right to be thinking about potential interactions.  Here's a breakdown of the situation, addressing your concerns and providing recommendations. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Concerns: Antihistamines & Seizures**\n\n* **Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and Seizures:** You're right to have read about diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in many over-the-counter sleep aids like some Benadryl products).  It *can* lower the seizure threshold in some individuals, meaning it makes it easier for a seizure to start. This is more of a concern with high doses, but it's a known potential risk. The mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be related to its anticholinergic effects (blocking acetylcholine).\n* **Dimenhydrinate (Gravol) is Different, But Still Needs Caution:** Dimenhydrinate is *not* the same as diphenhydramine, but it *is* an antihistamine.  It's an older generation antihistamine, similar to diphenhydramine, and shares some of those anticholinergic properties.  Therefore, the *potential* to lower the seizure threshold exists, although it's generally considered **less** pronounced than with diphenhydramine.  However, that doesn't mean it's zero risk.\n* **Divalproex Sodium (Valproic Acid/Valproate):** Your primary epilepsy medication, divalproex sodium, works to stabilize electrical activity in the brain and *raise* the seizure threshold.  This is why you're concerned about something counteracting it.\n* **Interaction Potential:** While divalproex sodium is generally effective, it doesn't provide absolute protection.  Combining it with any substance that *could* lower the seizure threshold isn't ideal.\n\n\n\n**Specifically Regarding Your Situation**\n\n* **Timing:** You've taken your divalproex sodium 1.5 hours ago. This is good; your medication should be at a reasonably stable level in your system. *However,* it's not at its peak effect immediately.\n* **Dosage of Gravol:**  A standard dose of Gravol (dimenhydrinate) is usually 50-100mg.\n* **Your History:** The fact that you haven't had a seizure in years is reassuring, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk.  Seizure thresholds can change over time, and the combination of medications could potentially alter yours.\n* **Sleep Schedule Issues:**  I understand you want to fix your sleep schedule. While self-treating with an antihistamine *might* work short-term, it's not a sustainable solution and carries the risk we've discussed.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations (Prioritized)**\n\n1. **BEST OPTION:  CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST.**  This is the *most* important step.  Explain you've read about potential interactions between divalproex sodium and dimenhydrinate (Gravol) and want their specific advice, given your medical history. They know your case best and can give tailored reassurance or warn against using it.  A quick phone call could save you a lot of worry.\n2. **If you cannot reach a doctor or pharmacist *immediately*:**  **I would strongly advise *against* taking the Gravol.**  The potential risk, however small, isn't worth it when you're managing a condition like epilepsy.  Prioritize safety.\n3. **Focus on Sleep Hygiene:** Instead of medication, try to improve your sleep habits:\n    *   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** This is what you're aiming for.  Go to bed and wake up around the same time *every day*, even on weekends.\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool Room:** Optimize your sleep environment.\n    *   **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol:** Especially close to bedtime.\n    *   **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  A warm bath, reading (not on a screen), or gentle stretching can help.\n    *   **Limit Screen Time:**  Screens emit blue light that interferes with sleep.\n4. **Discuss Long-Term Sleep Solutions with your Doctor:** If your sleep issues persist, talk to your doctor about appropriate, safe, and long-term strategies for improving your sleep.  They may suggest other options, including referral to a sleep specialist.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Your doctor or pharmacist is the best source of information about potential drug interactions and what is safe for *you*.  If you experience any unusual symptoms after taking any medication, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\n\n**To help me give you more tailored (but still non-medical advice) information, could you tell me:**\n\n*   What time did you take your divalproex sodium?\n*   What time are you hoping to go to bed?\n*   What is your usual sleep schedule like?

        "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds concerning, but also potentially manageable. Let's break down what's going on and what you should do. Given your medical history (epilepsy, recent surgeries, and medication list), it's good you're asking and being proactive. Here's a detailed response addressing your concerns, offering potential causes, advice, and when to seek medical attention:\n\n**Understanding What's Likely Happening**\n\nSeveral possibilities could explain the rashes at the IV insertion sites:\n\n* **IV Insertion Irritation/Phlebitis:**  This is *very* common. Repeated attempts to place an IV, especially if there was some resistance (vein rolling, etc.) can cause inflammation and irritation in the vein and surrounding tissue.  This presents as redness, tenderness, and sometimes a small, raised bump.  It's usually *not* a true allergy, but a physical reaction to the trauma of the insertion.  It can sometimes lead to a localized area of inflammation (phlebitis).\n* **Contact Dermatitis:**  The adhesive on the IV dressing, the antiseptic used to prepare the skin (often chlorhexidine or iodine), or even the IV fluid itself *could* cause a localized allergic or irritant contact dermatitis.\n* **Localized Infection:** While less likely *immediately* after IV placement and with only a rash, it's always a consideration.  Bacteria can enter through the skin during IV insertion.  However, that usually is accompanied by increasing pain, warmth, swelling, and potentially pus.\n* **Drug Reaction (Less Likely, but Needs Consideration):** While less common from an IV site rash *alone*, it's important to consider it, especially given your medication list and the fact you were receiving IV medications recently.  However, a systemic allergic reaction (affecting the whole body) usually has other symptoms *in addition* to a rash (hives elsewhere, swelling of the face/lips/tongue, difficulty breathing, etc.).\n* **Underlying Skin Sensitivity:** If you have sensitive skin or a history of eczema or dermatitis, you may be more prone to reactions to any of the above.\n\n\n\n**Why It's a Bit More Important to Take Seriously Given Your History:**\n\n* **Epilepsy & Medications:** Your epilepsy and the medications you take (gabapentin, celecoxib, cyclobenzaprine) *could* potentially interact with other substances or make you more sensitive to certain reactions. It\u2019s crucial to not dismiss symptoms.\n* **Recent Surgery:**  Your body is still healing from the microdiscectomy (and the revision). Your immune system is working, and any added irritation or inflammation should be carefully monitored.\n* **Multiple IV Attempts:** The multiple attempts significantly increase the chances of irritation or minor trauma to the tissues.\n\n\n\n**What You Can Try at Home (For Now - But Monitor Closely!)**\n\n* **Cool Compresses:** Apply cool, damp compresses to the rash areas for 15-20 minutes several times a day. This can help reduce inflammation and itching.\n* **Topical Hydrocortisone:**  Over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream can help reduce inflammation and itching. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas 2-3 times daily. *Do not* use on broken skin or open wounds.\n* **Antihistamine:**  An over-the-counter oral antihistamine (like Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin) can help with the itching.  *Be cautious with Benadryl (diphenhydramine),* as it can cause drowsiness \u2013 especially relevant as you're recovering from surgery. Zyrtec or Claritin are less sedating. **Important Consideration:**  Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking *any* new over-the-counter medication, considering your current medication list (especially gabapentin, as some antihistamines can interact).\n* **Keep the Area Clean & Dry:** Gently wash the areas with mild soap and water and pat dry. Avoid harsh soaps, lotions, or perfumes.\n* **Avoid Scratching:**  I know it's hard, but scratching can worsen the inflammation and potentially introduce bacteria.\n\n**When You *Definitely* Need to See a Doctor (Don't Delay)**\n\n**These symptoms warrant an immediate medical evaluation. Go to urgent care or the ER:**\n\n* **Spreading Rash:** If the rash extends beyond the immediate IV insertion site.\n* **Fever:** A temperature of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher.\n* **Increased Pain:**  Significant increase in pain around the rash, especially if it\u2019s throbbing.\n* **Warmth & Swelling:**  Increased warmth and swelling around the rash.\n* **Pus or Drainage:** Any sign of pus or drainage from the site.\n* **Red Streaks:** Red streaks radiating from the rash.  This is a sign of lymphangitis (infection spreading through the lymphatic system).\n* **Systemic Symptoms:**  Any other symptoms like:\n    * Difficulty breathing\n    * Swelling of your face, lips, or tongue\n    * Hives elsewhere on your body\n    * Dizziness or lightheadedness\n    * Nausea or vomiting\n    * Confusion\n\n**When to Schedule a Non-Urgent Doctor's Appointment (Within 1-2 days):**\n\n* **Rash Doesn't Improve After 24-48 Hours of Home Treatment:** If the rash isn't getting better or is worsening despite the measures above.\n* **Persistent Itching:**  If the itching is severe and interfering with your sleep or daily activities.\n* **You're Feeling Anxious:** Given your epilepsy and recent surgeries, if you're simply worried and would like a professional opinion, it's always best to err on the side of caution.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Information to Tell Your Doctor:**\n\n* **Detailed History:**  Clearly explain the timing of the IV placements, how many attempts were made, and when the rashes appeared.\n* **Current Medications:**  Provide a complete list of all medications you take, including dosages.\n* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor about any known allergies (medications, latex, adhesives, etc.).\n* **Epilepsy Management:**  Mention your epilepsy and how well controlled it is.\n* **Recent Surgeries:** Remind them of the recent microdiscectomy and revision surgery.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very thoughtful and concerned question. It's good you're applying your medical school reasoning, and it's *not* necessarily overthinking. It's responsible to consider the possibilities, especially given the progression you're observing. Let's break down the differential diagnosis, testing, and how to approach this, keeping in mind I'm an AI and can't give medical advice \u2013 this is for educational purposes.  You need to discuss this with your mother's physicians.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\nYou have a complex case.  Several factors are at play:\n\n* **Post-surgical cognitive changes:** The mild cognitive impairment after surgery 12 years ago is important. The type of surgery matters (e.g., cardiac, general anesthesia, etc.).  It's crucial to know if it was a sudden change or slower onset.  Some post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) can be persistent, but doesn\u2019t always progress.\n* **Depression:**  Depression, especially in later life, is strongly linked with cognitive impairment.  \"Pseudo-dementia\" \u2013 cognitive symptoms *caused* by depression \u2013 is a real phenomenon. It\u2019s great she's being followed by psychiatry.\n* **New Symptoms:** The difficulty in *expressing* information (a language/output issue, not just understanding) & feeling overwhelmed with multitasking are the concerning new elements.  This is *different* than typical depressive cognitive slowing.  This is what's rightly prompting your concern.\n* **Independence in ADLs:** She's still able to manage daily living, suggesting early stages of any impairment, or a fluctuating condition.\n\n\n\n**Differential Diagnosis (Without Imaging/Labs \u2013 focusing on clinical presentation)**\n\nHere's a differential, categorized by likelihood (though order can change with more information).  I\u2019m laying out possibilities \u2013 *not* diagnosing.  This is a spectrum.\n\n**1.  Depression with Atypical Features/Treatment-Resistant Depression**\n\n* **Why it's higher on the list:** She already has a diagnosis.  Depression *can* present with prominent cognitive deficits, particularly with executive function (planning, multitasking).  Difficulties with expressive language can also occur.  If her depression isn't fully responding to treatment, cognitive symptoms might be more prominent.\n* **What would support this:** Improvement in cognitive symptoms with optimized antidepressant treatment or other psychiatric interventions.\n\n**2.  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) \u2013 Progression/New Type**\n\n* **Why it's possible:** Although initially attributed to surgery, the initial MCI could be evolving, or a different *type* of MCI is now emerging. There are different types of MCI (amnestic, non-amnestic \u2013 affecting language, executive function, visuospatial skills).  Her new symptoms suggest a non-amnestic type.\n* **What would support this:**  Cognitive testing showing consistent deficits beyond what would be expected for depression alone, progressive worsening over time, and specific patterns of impairment.\n\n**3.  Early Dementia (Several subtypes possible)**\n\n* **Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD):** While traditionally associated with memory loss first, atypical presentations are common, especially in early stages.  Problems with executive function, language (expressive aphasia \u2013 difficulty *finding* words, or organizing thoughts into speech), and visuospatial skills can be early signs.\n* **Vascular Dementia:** This is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain (small strokes or other vascular changes).  Symptoms can be stepwise (sudden worsening followed by plateaus) and often involve executive function and language.  Her past medical history (if including conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol) increases the risk.\n* **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD):**  This presents more with behavioral changes and/or language difficulties (often as the primary symptom) than memory loss. This is why her difficulties expressing information are very relevant to consider.  A few subtypes exist (behavioral variant FTD & language variants).\n\n**4.  Other Considerations (Less Likely, but important to brainstorm)**\n\n* **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH):** Classic triad: gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia.  Cognitive impairment can be subtle at first and affect executive function.\n* **Medication Side Effects:** Certain medications can worsen cognition.  A thorough medication review is essential.\n* **Subclinical Thyroid Issues:** Less likely given medical follow-up but warrants consideration.\n* **Vitamin Deficiencies:** (B12, folate) - Usually picked up on routine labs, but worth remembering.\n\n\n\n**Role of MMSE & Clock Test in Screening**\n\nThese are *screening* tools, not diagnostic tools. They are valuable *first steps* to help decide if further evaluation is needed.\n\n* **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE):**\n    * **What it tests:** Orientation, registration (repeating words), attention & calculation, recall, and language.\n    * **Strengths:**  Quick, widely used, good for detecting *global* cognitive impairment.\n    * **Weaknesses:**  Not very sensitive to mild impairment, can be affected by education and cultural factors, doesn\u2019t assess all cognitive domains (like executive function in detail). A score of 24 or less is generally considered indicative of cognitive impairment, but this varies based on age and education.\n* **Clock Drawing Test:**\n    * **What it tests:** Visuospatial abilities, planning, and executive function. It's a surprisingly sensitive test for detecting early dementia.  Patients are asked to draw a clock face, put in all the numbers, and set it to a specific time.\n    * **Strengths:** Quick, simple, identifies visuospatial and executive function deficits.\n    * **Weaknesses:** Can be affected by visual impairment or hand tremors. Scoring is subjective.\n\n**How the results are interpreted:**\n\n* **Normal MMSE & Normal Clock Test:** Makes dementia less likely, but *doesn't rule it out*. It could be very early stages, or the impairment is subtle and not captured by these tests.\n* **Abnormal MMSE/Clock Test:** Flags the need for further, more comprehensive neuropsychological testing.  The pattern of deficits (e.g., disproportionate difficulty with recall versus language) provides clues.\n\n\n\n**Important Next Steps - What You Should Advocate For:**\n\n1. **Discuss with your mother's psychiatrist:** Explain your observations about the change in her communication and the sense of being overwhelmed.  They can assess if her current depression treatment is fully optimized and if these symptoms align with her depression or suggest something else.\n2. **Neuropsychological Testing:** This is *crucial*.  A neuropsychologist will administer a battery of tests that assess all cognitive domains (memory, language, attention, executive function, visuospatial skills) in detail. This is far more sensitive than the MMSE and will help pinpoint the specific areas of impairment.\n3. **Neurological Exam:** A neurologist can rule out other neurological conditions that might be contributing to the symptoms.\n4. **Consider Brain Imaging (CT or MRI):** While you asked about diagnosing *without* imaging, it will very likely be necessary if concerns persist after neuropsychological testing. Rule out stroke, tumors, hydrocephalus, and look for patterns suggestive of AD or FTD.\n5. **Detailed Medical History Review:** Including past surgeries, anesthesia type, and a complete list of medications.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **You are not a doctor *yet*:** Your observations are valuable, but ultimately, diagnosis and treatment are the responsibility of qualified medical professionals.\n* **Avoid self-diagnosis (and projecting your fears):** It's easy to get caught up in the worst-case scenarios.  Focus on gathering information and advocating for a thorough evaluation.\n* **Be patient:**  The diagnostic process can take time.\n* **Support your mother:**  No matter the cause of her symptoms, providing emotional support and helping her navigate the medical system is incredibly important.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, let's break down these results and your symptoms. It's good you're paying attention to changes in your body and seeking to understand what's going on.  I'll give you a comprehensive response, but **please read the important disclaimer at the end.**  This is *not* medical advice, and you *must* discuss this with your doctor.\n\n**Understanding Your Blood Work - The \"H\" Values**\n\nYour blood work shows elevated levels in three areas related to red blood cells:\n\n* **Hemoglobin (Hb): 16.4 H (High)** \u2013 Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Normal ranges vary slightly between labs, but generally, for women, it's around 12.1-15.1 g/dL.  Yours is above that.\n* **Red Blood Cell Count (RBC): 5.22 H (High)** \u2013 This is the number of red blood cells you have. Normal range for women is typically 4.2-5.4 million cells/mcL. Yours is on the higher end.\n* **Hematocrit (Hct): 47.8 H (High)** \u2013 Hematocrit measures the percentage of your blood volume made up of red blood cells.  Normal range for women is generally 36-48%. Yours is a little above that.\n\n**What Do These High Levels Mean?**\n\nThese results *together* suggest **polycythemia** \u2013 a condition where you have too many red blood cells.  There are a few different *kinds* of polycythemia, and figuring out *why* yours is elevated is the next step. Here are the possibilities, categorized, along with how relating it to your situation:\n\n* **Polycythemia Vera (PV):** This is a rare blood cancer where your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It's less likely given your age, but needs to be ruled out.\n* **Secondary Polycythemia:** This is *much* more common and has many potential causes.  This is where it's important to investigate. Causes include:\n    * **Hypoxia (Low Oxygen Levels):** This is a common cause.  Things that can cause hypoxia:\n        * **Smoking:** Do you smoke?\n        * **Lung Disease:**  Do you have any history of lung problems (asthma, COPD, etc.?).\n        * **Sleep Apnea:**  This is a *very* common cause.  Repeatedly stopping breathing during sleep lowers oxygen levels, and the body compensates by making more red blood cells. *Given your sleep disturbance, this is a strong possibility to discuss with your doctor.*\n        * **High Altitude Living:** Do you live at a high altitude?\n    * **Kidney Problems:**  The kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) that stimulates red blood cell production.  Kidney tumors or certain kidney diseases can cause *overproduction* of EPO.\n    * **Certain Medications:**  This is where your Lamictal comes in. *Rarely*, some medications can stimulate red blood cell production.\n    * **Dehydration:**  Being significantly dehydrated can temporarily increase hemoglobin and hematocrit.\n    * **Carbon Monoxide Exposure:** While less common, chronic exposure can cause this.\n\n**Your Symptoms and How They Relate (or Might)**\n\nLet's connect your symptoms to the possible causes:\n\n* **Night Sweats:**  Night sweats can be a symptom of polycythemia vera (the blood cancer version), *but* they have many, many other causes.  They can be related to hormones, anxiety, infections, or even just variations in body temperature regulation.  The fact they wake you up is something to mention to your doctor.\n* **Itchiness After Hot Showers:** This is a classic symptom of **polycythemia vera** \u2013 the increased red blood cells can release histamine, causing itching, *especially* after warmth (like a hot shower). This is a concerning symptom that your doctor will want to address.\n* **Fatigue:** Fatigue is a very non-specific symptom, meaning it can happen with *lots* of different conditions. Your low Vitamin D likely contributes, as does poor sleep.  However, having too *many* red blood cells can also cause fatigue because the blood becomes thicker and harder for the heart to pump.\n\n**Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Blood Counts**\n\nWhile Lamictal doesn't typically *cause* polycythemia, it's important your doctor knows you're taking it.  Rarely, it can cause changes in blood cell counts, and it's important to rule out medication as a contributing factor.\n\n**What Your Doctor Will Likely Do**\n\nYour doctor will likely:\n\n1. **Repeat the Blood Work:**  A single high reading doesn\u2019t always mean a problem. They'll likely repeat the CBC (complete blood count) to confirm the elevated levels.\n2. **Further Testing:**  To determine the *cause* of the polycythemia, they'll order more tests, potentially including:\n    * **Erythropoietin (EPO) Level:**  To see if your kidneys are overproducing the hormone that stimulates red blood cell production.\n    * **Kidney Function Tests:** To assess kidney health.\n    * **Oxygen Saturation Levels:** To check for hypoxia.\n    * **Sleep Study:** (Polysomnography) - To rule out sleep apnea.  *Especially* given your sleep problems.\n    * **Genetic Testing (JAK2 Mutation):** If they suspect polycythemia vera.\n3. **Review Your Medications:**  A careful review of all your medications, including Lamictal, and potentially discussing alternatives if appropriate.  (Do *not* stop or change your medication without your doctor's guidance!).\n4. **Physical Exam:**  Checking for an enlarged spleen (which can sometimes occur with PV).\n5. **Ask About Your History:** Smoking, altitude, lung problems, family history of blood disorders.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "36F 145 pounds 5'8 Started having issues with everything in my early to mid20s I'll list everything just in caseDIAGNOSED: Epilepsy - diagnosed in 2007 Narcolepsy with Cataplexy - diagnosed in 2009 Raynaud's with Erythermalagia - diagnosed 2016Other symptoms: Pins and needles in stomach, face, eyes, extremities, head -not all at once -this can occur at random times -sometimes while I work out, having sex (which can also cause my fingers or lips to stiffen and I have to wait for them to work itself out) sitting on the toilet, or laying down (which only happens to my stomach) Every blue moon, I'll have muscle spasms feeling like they are steming from my spine after I've laid down. It feels more neurological, if that makes sense.My body will feel like it's shaking on the inside, almost like it's vibrating. Usually when I'm tired.I have urge incontinence probably due to years of battling constipation. Must admit, I think it's getting better as it's not as frequently happening as it was.My left nostril will drip or run snot sometimes without me even realizing it (newer symptom) My primary doctor said it's probably just post nasal drip and prescribed me nasal spray twice a day. It does help dry it out but if I miss even one time, my husband will point out it running down.Recently switched neurologist and had a EEG done which I had an episode though it showed on the test and the nurse helped me through it, it registered as not a seizure or he said it didn't convince him that it was though the nurse clearly saw it.  At times when I'm feeling off I'm rushed with rapid heart beat, shakiness, and I can't read (everything looks to be in another language). At this point I feel confused, scared, angry, and rushed. Happens a lot when I have decisions to make. Restaurants, retail store, airport, etc.I get brain fog a lot but as long as I take my nuvigil I do a lot better.Here's why I'm posting... I can hear everything while having an episode, though sometimes when I repeat back what was happening while I have a seizure it's not all the way correct. I can't talk during it. My eyes roll back. The last one I shook some, which doesn't usually happens. I've had times where my hands cripple up (rarely). I usually feel a \"drooping\" or pulling in my bottom lip when things start and a complete lack of ability to use my muscles. They feel really heavy. I tend to stare right beforehand. The second to last episode I felt a pulling sensation, like someone was turning my head towards the left. When it ended, I head was facing left.My neurologist is putting me on Vimpat. I was taking Xyrem for ten years but last year I switched to ambien because my snoring got really bad.Current medication: Ambien 5mg Nuvigil 250mg I have an IUD I'll be starting Vimpat 100mgWasn't very active in my 20's Started working out in my 30's Past year in a half I have focused on strength training and cardio 5-6 times a week.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *lot* of information, and it paints a picture of a very complex case. You've been dealing with a constellation of symptoms for a long time, and navigating multiple diagnoses. It's understandable you're seeking information (and perhaps reassurance) given the new medication and recent neurological changes.  Let's break this down into sections, addressing concerns and potential avenues for exploration. **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response \u2013 I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**\n\n**1. Summary of Key Issues:**\n\n* **Neurological:** Epilepsy, Narcolepsy with Cataplexy (history of Xyrem use, now Ambien), episodes described as not definitively seizures by your new neurologist despite EEG findings, specific sensations preceding and during events (pulling, drooping lip, heavy limbs, staring), occasional shaking, reported \"incorrect\" recall of events *during* episodes, possible alteration of head position.\n* **Autonomic/Vascular:** Raynaud's with Erythermalgia (vasculopathy affecting blood flow), fluctuating heart rate, possible postural tachycardia (shakiness could be related).\n* **Sensory/Neuropathic:** Pins and needles in various locations (stomach, face, eyes, extremities, head), internal shaking/vibrating sensation.\n* **Gastrointestinal:** Chronic constipation leading to urge incontinence (improving).\n* **ENT:** Unilateral nasal drip.\n* **Psychological/Cognitive:** Brain fog (improved with Nuvigil), anxiety/fear/anger triggered by decision-making situations, difficulty reading during episodes.\n* **Lifestyle:** Relatively new commitment to regular exercise.\n\n\n\n**2. Concerns & Potential Explanations (To Discuss with Your Doctor):**\n\n* **The Nature of Your \"Episodes\":** This is the central concern.  Your description isn't a classic seizure presentation, but the EEG changes *and* the physical manifestations (loss of muscle control, eye rolling, potential head turning) are significant.  The fact the nurse observed something that doesn't fully convince the neurologist is concerning. Possible considerations:\n    * **Complex Partial Seizures with Unusual Features:** These can present with subtle movements, automatisms (like staring), and alteration of awareness. The sensations *before* the episode (pulling, lip drooping) are often auras associated with seizures.\n    * **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**  These are episodes that *look* like seizures but have a psychological origin. They\u2019re often triggered by stress and can be hard to differentiate from epileptic seizures. (It's important *not* to interpret this as \"faking.\" They are real, involuntary events but not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.) The increased happenings in stressful environments (restaurants etc) could point in this direction, along with feelings of overwhelm.\n    * **Narcolepsy-Related Phenomena Beyond Cataplexy:**  Sometimes, narcolepsy can have atypical presentations with elements resembling seizures. The overlap with your known cataplexy adds to the complexity.\n    * **Rare Neurological Conditions:**  Given the breadth of symptoms, exploring less common neurological conditions that could cause a combination of these presentations is prudent.\n* **The Pins and Needles/Sensory Changes:** These are wide-ranging. Potential causes:\n    * **Neuropathy:**  Could be related to underlying vascular issues (Raynaud's), metabolic factors, or a separate neurological process.\n    * **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines present with unusual sensory symptoms.\n    * **Central Sensitization:**  Chronic pain and neurological conditions can sometimes lead to the nervous system becoming hypersensitive, resulting in widespread sensory symptoms.\n* **Raynaud's & Erythermalgia:** These are often linked to autoimmune or vascular disorders. It\u2019s important to rule out underlying conditions such as Lupus.\n* **Urge Incontinence/Constipation:**  Important to continue addressing this with lifestyle modifications (hydration, fiber) and discuss further if it doesn't continue to improve.\n* **Nasal Drip:** While your doctor suspects post-nasal drip, persistent unilateral symptoms warrant further investigation (allergies, structural issues).\n\n**3. Vimpat (Lacosamide) and its implications:**\n\n* **Mechanism:** Vimpat is an antiepileptic drug that works by slowing down nerve impulses. It's often used for focal seizures.\n* **Why your doctor is prescribing it:** Considering the EEG findings and your concerning episodes, the neurologist is likely attempting to stabilize your neurological activity, even if they can't definitively classify the episodes.\n* **Potential side effects:** Common side effects include dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and blurred vision. Monitor for any new or worsening symptoms.  It's important to discuss any concerns with your doctor, especially regarding potential interactions with your other medications (Nuvigil & Ambien).\n\n**4. Important Questions to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n* **Can we revisit the EEG findings in detail?**  What specifically did the test show, and why does he not definitively classify it as a seizure?\n* **What other diagnostic tests are being considered?** (MRI of the brain, autonomic testing, nerve conduction studies, blood tests to rule out autoimmune conditions).\n* **What are the goals of treatment with Vimpat?** What changes do we hope to see?\n* **How will the Vimpat be monitored?** (Blood tests, symptom tracking).\n* **Is a referral to a specialist (e.g., epileptologist, autonomic neurologist) appropriate?**\n* **Could PNES be a possibility, and if so, what steps would be taken to investigate?**\n* **Given the overlap with Narcolepsy, what is his professional opinion on the possibility this is tied to that diagnosis?**\n\n\n\n\n**5. Lifestyle Considerations**\n\n* **Exercise:**  Continuing your exercise routine is great, but be mindful of how it impacts your symptoms.  Note if exercise consistently triggers or worsens anything.\n* **Sleep:**  Switching from Xyrem to Ambien affected your sleep structure, and potentially the seizure threshold.\n* **Stress Management:** Given the link between stress and your episodes, incorporating effective stress-reduction techniques (yoga, meditation, deep breathing) is crucial.\n* **Diet:** A balanced diet can support overall neurological health.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Your case is complex, and proper diagnosis and treatment require a thorough evaluation by a medical doctor.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask for clarification and further investigation from your healthcare team.\n\n\n\nTo help me refine this information, could you tell me:\n\n*   **How long have you been experiencing the unilateral nasal drip?**\n*   **How frequently do the episodes occur?** (Roughly per week/month)\n*   **Have there been any changes in your other medications or health conditions recently?**\n* **What does the \"internal shaking\" feel like?** Is it visible?"

What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and it's good you're being proactive in gathering information. Let's break down the MRI findings, your history, and potential prognosis.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 this is not medical advice and you *must* discuss this with your doctor.**\n\n**Understanding the MRI/Neuroquant Results:**\n\n* **Hippocampal Volume (72nd Percentile):** This is generally considered within the normal range. It means your hippocampal volume is larger than 72% of the people in the Neuroquant database of the same age and gender. This is reassuring in terms of the structure of the hippocampus itself seemingly intact.\n* **Hippocampal Occupancy Score (32nd Percentile):**  This is the concerning finding. This is *not* about the size of the hippocampus, but rather how much of the space *around* the hippocampus is filled with brain tissue. A low occupancy score suggests increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the hippocampus.  Think of it like this: the hippocampus is a balloon. A normal occupancy score means the balloon is snugly fitting within its space. A low score means there's a lot of empty space around the balloon.  This often relates to atrophy (shrinkage) of surrounding brain structures, not necessarily the hippocampus itself, but a reduced structural support for it.\n* **Ventricular Volumes (94th & 74th Percentile):** Slightly enlarged ventricles (spaces within the brain that contain CSF) are common with age and can be seen with some level of atrophy. The superior lateral ventricles are on the higher end of normal, but not hugely concerning.  The inferior lateral ventricles are closer to average.\n\n**What Does Low Hippocampal Occupancy *Mean* in Your Case?**\n\nA low hippocampal occupancy score can be associated with:\n\n* **Atrophy:**  This is the most common explanation. Atrophy means tissue loss. While your hippocampal volume is currently normal, the surrounding tissue *could* be atrophying, leading to increased CSF.\n* **Inflammation:** Inflammation in or around the hippocampus can also contribute to decreased occupancy.\n* **Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Changes:** While less likely at your age, it's something to consider in the context of ongoing symptoms.\n* **Normal Variation:** There\u2019s a range of normal, and some individuals naturally have lower occupancy scores. *However*, given your symptoms, it's unlikely this is just normal variation.\n\n**Connecting the Dots: Your History & Symptoms**\n\nYour history makes this situation more complex and points towards several potential contributing factors:\n\n* **COVID & Vaccine Reaction:** This is *highly* relevant.  There's growing research showing COVID-19 can have neurological effects, including inflammation and structural changes in the brain.  Post-vaccine reactions, while rare, can also involve neurological symptoms. The timing of symptom onset *after* the vaccine reaction strongly suggests a potential link.  You're right to consider that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, following the initial COVID infection, could be impacting the brain.\n* **Prior CBD Use:** CBD can be tricky.  The fact that it caused depersonalization and amnesia *before* COVID/vaccine suggests you may have a particular sensitivity to substances affecting the endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in brain function. While likely not directly causing the current issues, it's a relevant piece of the puzzle showing potential neurological vulnerability.\n* **Epilepsy & Trileptal:** Epilepsy itself can sometimes lead to subtle changes in brain structure over time. Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have cognitive side effects in some people.\n* **Depression:** Depression can be both a cause and a consequence of neurological changes.  It\u2019s a factor to consider, but the specific symptoms you describe (depersonalization, reduced consciousness, memory loss) suggest something beyond typical depression is happening.\n* **Specific Symptoms:**\n    * **Memory Loss:** Directly related to hippocampal function.\n    * **Depersonalization:** Associated with disrupted brain networks and can be a sign of neurological dysfunction.\n    * **Reduced Consciousness:** This is a more concerning symptom and suggests a significant impact on brain function.\n\n\n\n**Possible Scenarios (Based on Information Provided)**\n\nGiven all of this, here are a few possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Post-Viral/Vaccine-Induced Neuroinflammation:** COVID may have triggered initial inflammation, and the vaccine reaction amplified that, leading to inflammation around the hippocampus and some initial (subtle) atrophy.  The low occupancy score reflects this.\n2. **Autoimmune Component:**  COVID and, potentially, the vaccine could have triggered an autoimmune response that is now targeting brain tissue.\n3. **Exacerbation of Underlying Vulnerability:** You might have had a pre-existing, subtle neurological vulnerability (related to epilepsy or sensitivity to substances), and the COVID/vaccine combination pushed you over a threshold.\n4. **Combined Effects:** It\u2019s likely a combination of these factors.\n\n\n\n**Prognosis & What Needs to Happen Next (Crucially, Discuss with Your Doctor)**\n\nThe prognosis is difficult to predict without further investigation. However, *early intervention is key.* Here\u2019s what needs to happen:\n\n* **Neurologist Consultation:** This is *essential*.  You need a neurologist specializing in neuroinflammation or post-viral neurological syndromes.\n* **Repeat MRI with Neuroquant:** A follow-up MRI in 3-6 months would be valuable to see if the occupancy score is changing. This helps determine if the changes are stable, progressive, or potentially improving.\n* **Extensive Neurological Exam:** A thorough neurological assessment to evaluate memory, cognition, reflexes, and other neurological functions.\n* **Blood Tests:**  To look for markers of inflammation, autoimmune antibodies, and vitamin deficiencies.\n* **Consider CSF Analysis:**  In some cases, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid for inflammation or other abnormalities.\n* **EEG:** Given your epilepsy history, an EEG may be needed to assess seizure activity.\n* **Cognitive Testing:** Formal neuropsychological testing to objectively measure your cognitive deficits.\n* **Rule Out Other Causes:** The neurologist will want to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or other medical conditions.\n* **Potential Treatments (Discuss with your doctor):**\n    * **Anti-inflammatory protocols:** Under the guidance of a neurologist this could include medications or dietary changes.\n    * **Neurorehabilitation:** Cognitive therapy and other rehabilitation strategies can help improve cognitive function.\n    * **Management of Epilepsy:** Ensure your epilepsy is well-controlled.\n    * **Mental Health Support:** Continue to address depression.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really important and nuanced question, and it's good you're thinking carefully about this, especially given your medical history. You're right to be cautious, and it's excellent you're proactively seeking information. Here's a breakdown of the current understanding of COVID-19 vaccines and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), with a focus on your situation as someone with epilepsy on Keppra/Lamictal.  I will provide information, but **this is not medical advice, and you MUST discuss this with your neurologist and primary care physician before making any decisions.**\n\n**1. COVID-19 Vaccines and GBS: What Does the Data Show?**\n\n* **Initial Concerns & the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Vaccine:** The primary signal for a potential link between COVID-19 vaccines and GBS initially emerged with the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine.  The CDC and FDA identified a *small* increased risk of GBS following Janssen vaccination, particularly within 42 days of receiving the vaccine. The estimated risk was about 3.23-5.1 cases per million doses administered. This led to a warning being added to the Janssen vaccine information.  It's important to note this risk is still considered very rare.\n* **mRNA Vaccines (Pfizer & Moderna):**  The data regarding GBS and the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are considerably more reassuring.  While some cases of GBS *have* been reported following mRNA vaccination, studies have *not* shown a significantly increased risk compared to the background rate of GBS in the general population.  Some large studies actually suggest the risk might be *lower* after mRNA vaccines than after a COVID-19 infection.\n* **COVID-19 Infection & GBS:**  Crucially, the risk of developing GBS is actually *higher* after a COVID-19 infection itself than after vaccination (especially the mRNA vaccines).  This is a critical point.  For many, the risk mitigation of preventing severe COVID with vaccination outweighs the small potential risk of GBS.\n* **Recent Data (Ongoing Surveillance):** Surveillance continues, and the CDC and other health agencies are constantly monitoring for safety signals.  The relative risk seems to remain fairly stable as of late 2023/early 2024:  Janssen carries a slightly higher risk, and mRNA vaccines have a very low or no increased risk.\n\n\n\n**2.  Your Specific Situation: Epilepsy, Keppra/Lamictal & GBS Risk**\n\n* **Epilepsy & Vaccination:** There's no specific contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination for people with epilepsy, even those on medications like Keppra (levetiracetam) and Lamictal (lamotrigine).  In fact, people with epilepsy are often considered higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 infection due to potential disruptions in seizure control from fever and illness.  Vaccination is generally recommended to protect against severe illness.\n* **Keppra/Lamictal & Immune Response:** Neither Keppra nor Lamictal are typically considered to significantly suppress the immune system to the point where it would dramatically affect vaccine response.  However, *any* medication that has an effect on the nervous system can theoretically complicate the picture.  Your doctor will want to consider this.\n* **Your Previous GBS History:**  This is the MOST important factor. A prior history of GBS, even if it was unrelated to a vaccine, is often a reason for careful consideration and discussion with a neurologist.  If your GBS was mild and occurred a long time ago, your doctor might be more comfortable recommending vaccination.  If it was severe or recent, they might be more hesitant.  The decision really hinges on a risk/benefit analysis specific to *you*.\n\n**3. Vaccine Brand Choice (For You)**\n\nGiven your history of GBS, **mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) are generally considered the safer choice** compared to the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine.  The data consistently show a much lower (or no increased) risk of GBS with the mRNA vaccines.\n\n* **Pfizer vs. Moderna:** There isn't strong evidence to suggest one mRNA vaccine is significantly better than the other in terms of GBS risk.  Both have similar safety profiles.  Availability and personal preference (based on any other side effects you might be concerned about) could be the deciding factors.\n\n**4. Important Considerations & Questions to Ask Your Doctors**\n\n* **Neurologist Consultation:**  *Absolutely* essential. They understand your epilepsy, your medications, and your GBS history.\n* **Risk/Benefit Discussion:** Have a thorough discussion with your doctors about the risks of contracting COVID-19 (given your epilepsy) versus the small potential risk of GBS from vaccination.  Quantify these risks as much as possible.\n* **Timing:** If you and your doctor decide to proceed with vaccination, discuss the optimal timing of the vaccine relative to any recent neurological events or changes in your epilepsy control.\n* **Monitoring:**  Discuss what symptoms you should watch out for after vaccination that might indicate GBS (weakness, tingling, numbness, difficulty walking, etc.), and how quickly you should seek medical attention if they occur.\n* **Booster Recommendations:**  Keep up-to-date on booster recommendations, and specifically discuss the type of booster with your doctor, considering your history.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **CDC - Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) Following COVID-19 Vaccination:** [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/gbs.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/gbs.html)\n* **FDA - Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers:**  (Look for the updated fact sheet, as information changes)  [https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/janssen-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-authorization-fact-sheet-recipients-and-caregivers](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/janssen-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-authorization-fact-sheet-recipients-and-caregivers)\n* **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) - GBS:** [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/guillain-barre-syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/guillain-barre-syndrome)\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *complex* situation with a lot of moving parts, and frankly, chasing down the diagnosis is frustrating for you *and* the doctors. Let's break down what you've said, potential areas to explore, and suggestions for what to do next.  I'll aim for a comprehensive response, but remember **I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* discuss everything with your doctors.**\n\n**Here's a summary of your symptoms and findings:**\n\n* **Initial Event (June 2022):** Sudden chest pain (\"lightning bolt\"), followed by neurological symptoms.\n* **Neurological Symptoms:**\n    * Numbness (originally fingertips/toes, now burning and spreading up arms/legs)\n    * Extreme Fatigue\n    * Muscle Spasms/Cramps (worsening in legs)\n* **Neurological Investigations:**\n    * Epilepsy ruled out\n    * PNES (Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures) ruled out\n    * MS and Lyme disease still possibilities, but inconclusive.\n    * Low Testosterone identified, TRT started\n* **Recurring Rhabdomyolysis:**  Very high CK levels (peaked at 16000, responsive to flushing)\n* **Heat Intolerance:**  A significant trigger for rhabdomyolysis.\n* **Partial Relief with Lifestyle:** Exercise and diet temporarily help, but lead to overheating.\n\n\n\n**Let's consider potential underlying issues, keeping in mind the combination of symptoms is key:**\n\n**1. Rhabdomyolysis and Heat Intolerance - This is the Biggest Clue.**\n\nRhabdomyolysis is muscle breakdown.  The fact that it\u2019s *repeatedly* triggered by heat is extremely important. While many things *can* cause it, the heat sensitivity narrows the field.  Here are some possibilities:\n\n*   **Mitochondrial Myopathy:** This is a key consideration. Mitochondrial disorders affect the mitochondria, the \"powerhouses\" of cells.  They can be genetic, and can cause exercise intolerance, muscle pain/weakness, heat sensitivity, and rhabdomyolysis.  Symptoms can be variable and sometimes mimic other conditions. *This needs dedicated testing - see below.*\n*   **McArdle's Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type V):** This genetic metabolic disorder prevents muscles from breaking down glycogen for energy. Exercise and heat can trigger muscle cramps and rhabdomyolysis.\n*   **Carnitine Deficiency:** Carnitine is important for transporting fatty acids into mitochondria. Deficiency can lead to muscle weakness, cramps, and rhabdomyolysis, especially with exercise.\n* **Medication-Induced:**  While Testosterone Replacement Therapy *can* potentially be a culprit, it\u2019s less common with standard dosing, but *needs* to be evaluated (see later sections).  Think about *all* medications, supplements, and even over-the-counter drugs you are taking.\n*   **Channelopathies:**  These are disorders affecting ion channels in muscle cells, leading to abnormal muscle excitation and potentially rhabdomyolysis.\n\n**2. Neurological Symptoms (Numbness, Burning, Fatigue, Spasms)**\n\nThese symptoms are broad, making diagnosis tricky. Let's tie them in with the rhabdomyolysis:\n\n*   **MS:** Still on the table, but the recurring rhabdomyolysis is less typical of MS. It's good neuro is monitoring with occasional MRIs.\n*   **Lyme Disease:**  Important to continue ruling this out, especially if you live in an endemic area.  Testing can be unreliable, so consider a Lyme-literate doctor (LLMD) if you feel standard tests are insufficient.\n*   **Small Fiber Neuropathy:**  The burning sensation in your arms and legs strongly suggests this. It involves damage to small nerve fibers and can cause pain, temperature sensitivity, and autonomic dysfunction (which could potentially contribute to heat intolerance).  *Specific testing is required \u2013 see below.*\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:**  This could explain the heat intolerance, fatigue, and potentially some of the neurological symptoms. Autonomic nerves control involuntary functions like body temperature regulation, heart rate, and digestion.\n* **Low Testosterone Impact:** While addressing low T is important, it's unlikely to *cause* all these symptoms, though it can exacerbate fatigue and muscle weakness.\n\n**3. The \"Lightning Bolt\" Chest Pain**\n\nThis is a particularly concerning aspect.\n\n* **Cardiac Evaluation:**  While the neurology workup rules out some things, a *thorough* cardiac evaluation is crucial.  This should include:\n    *   ECG (Electrocardiogram)\n    *   Echocardiogram\n    *   Cardiac MRI (to look for subtle abnormalities)\n    *   Consideration of a stress test (carefully managed given the rhabdomyolysis risk).\n* **Esophageal Spasm:** While less likely given the neurological picture, esophageal spasms can mimic chest pain.\n\n\n\n**What to do next:  A Multi-Pronged Approach**\n\n1.  **Strongly Advocate for Mitochondrial Disease Testing:** This is paramount, given the heat intolerance and rhabdomyolysis.\n    *   **Muscle Biopsy:**  This is often the gold standard, looking for abnormalities in muscle fibers.\n    *   **Genetic Testing:**  To identify specific mitochondrial DNA mutations.\n    *   **Lactate and Pyruvate Levels:**  Blood tests to assess how efficiently your body processes energy.\n    *   **CoQ10 Levels:**  Coenzyme Q10 is important for mitochondrial function; deficiency can contribute to symptoms.\n    *  **Refer to a Metabolic Specialist:** Find a physician specializing in inherited metabolic disorders.  They will be best equipped to interpret the results.\n\n2. **Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN) Evaluation:**\n    *   **Skin Biopsy:**  Specifically, a punch biopsy of the skin to assess the density of nerve fibers.\n    *   **Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART):**  Tests sweat gland function, which is often affected in SFN.\n\n3.  **Comprehensive Autonomic Testing:**\n    *   **Tilt Table Test:**  To assess blood pressure and heart rate changes upon standing.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Testing:**  Measures the variation in time intervals between heartbeats, indicating autonomic function.\n    *   **Sweat Testing:** As above in SFN.\n\n4. **Medication Review:**\n    *   **TRT and CK Levels:**  Discuss with your endocrinologist.  Is the TRT dose appropriate?  Could it be contributing, even indirectly, to the rhabdomyolysis? *Don't stop TRT without medical advice.*\n    *   **Full Medication Inventory:**  Provide your doctors with a complete list of *everything* you take.\n    *   **Statin Use:** If you\u2019re on a statin, *immediately* review this with your doctor. Statins are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n5.  **Second (and even third) Neurological Opinion:**  Don't be afraid to seek opinions from other neurologists, especially those who specialize in neuromuscular disorders or autonomic dysfunction.\n\n6. **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Meticulously track:\n    *   Symptoms (type, severity, location)\n    *   Activities that trigger symptoms\n    *   Temperature and humidity\n    *    Food and drink intake\n    *   Medications and supplements\n    *   CK levels\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Be Your Own Advocate:** You know your body best. Don\u2019t be afraid to push for further investigation if you feel your concerns aren\u2019t being adequately addressed.\n*   **Documentation:** Keep copies of all your medical records, test results, and doctor\u2019s notes.\n*   **Find a Supportive Medical Team:** Building a team of doctors who communicate effectively and are willing to work together is crucial.\n*    **Don\u2019t Give Up:**  Diagnosis can be a long and frustrating process, but persistence is key.\n\n\n\n\n**To help me refine this further, could you tell me:**\n\n*   **Your age and gender?**\n*   **Family history of muscle disorders, neurological conditions, or mitochondrial diseases?**\n*   **Where do you live (general area \u2013 country/region)? This can help assess Lyme disease risk.**\n*   **Are you taking any other medications besides testosterone replacement?**\n*   **Have you had a cardiac evaluation (ECG, echo, etc.)?**\n\n\n\nI truly hope this comprehensive response is helpful. Again, remember to discuss *all* of this with your healthcare providers.  I wish you the best of luck in finding answers and getting the treatment you need."

        "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really tough situation and it's understandable why you're feeling so frustrated, ashamed, and confused. Let's break down what you've described and discuss what steps you should consider. It's good you're reaching out, even if it's through this format right now.  Here's a comprehensive response addressing your concerns, geared towards someone in Hong Kong:\n\n**Understanding Your Situation & Addressing Your Concerns**\n\n* **Two Events That Sound Like Seizures:** Your descriptions of both events \u2013 falling at the restaurant with yelling and struggling, and waking up to paramedics \u2013 *strongly* suggest seizure activity, especially the first one. The \"lagging brain\" feeling you describe after the second event (while common) is also consistent with post-ictal state (the period after a seizure).\n* **Epilepsy Diagnosis:** You were initially diagnosed with epilepsy, which is a reasonable starting point given your events.  However, diagnosis isn't always immediate or definitive, especially after just two events.  \n* **Lamictal (Lamotrigine):** Lamictal is a common anti-epileptic drug (AED). It's a good first choice for many types of epilepsy.  Starting it and titrating the dose is standard practice.\n* **Side Effects:** Memory problems *are* a recognized potential side effect of Lamictal, though it varies a lot from person to person.  It's good you're aware of this, and it's something to discuss with your doctor.\n* **The Vasovagal Episode Comment:** That comment on the forum was unhelpful and potentially damaging. Vasovagal syncope (fainting) is *very* different from a seizure, even though they can sometimes *look* similar to bystanders.  It's important not to self-diagnose based on one person's anecdote, especially online.  Vasovagal episodes are typically triggered by things like stress, pain, or prolonged standing and are characterized by a brief loss of consciousness often preceded by feeling lightheaded or nauseous. They don't usually involve uncontrolled movements or altered awareness like you described.\n* **Your Feelings:**  Shame and wanting to keep it secret are common reactions to seizures, especially the first ones.  It's okay to feel these things, but it's important *not* to let them prevent you from getting the best possible care.  Your frustration with the medication and the side effects is also completely valid.\n\n\n\n**What You Need To Do \u2013 A Plan of Action (Specifically for Hong Kong)**\n\n1. **Crucially: See a Neurologist \u2013 and Get a Second Opinion!**  This is the *most important* step.  You need a specialist.  Being discharged after the first seizure without a neurologist consult and only a diagnosis on a discharge slip isn't ideal practice.  The prescription of Lamictal after the second event is good, but still needs proper follow-up.\n\n   * **Where to find a Neurologist in Hong Kong:**\n      * **Hospital Authority:**  If you're using the public healthcare system, you'll need a referral from your GP (General Practitioner).  Contact your local polyclinic to start the process.  Major public hospitals with neurology departments include:\n         * Queen Mary Hospital\n         * Prince of Wales Hospital\n         * Queen Elizabeth Hospital\n         * United Christian Hospital\n      * **Private Practice:** If you have private health insurance or can afford private care, you have more options. Popular Neurologists:\n         * Dr. Chan Ka Man \u2013 https://www.drchan.hk/\n         * Dr. Cheung Shuk Han \u2013 https://www.shukhancheung.com/\n         * Search online directories like:  https://www.goldenmedals.com.hk/en/specialist/neurology/\n   * **What to Tell the Neurologist:**  Be *very* detailed.  Bring a written account of everything you've described here.  Specifically:\n      * Your full history, including the two events.\n      * Your feelings *during* the events (as much as you can remember).\n      * What happened *immediately after* both events.\n      * What you told paramedics\n      * The medications you're taking (Lamictal dosage).\n      * All your side effects, *especially* the memory problems.  Be specific about *how* your memory is affected.\n      * Your concerns about whether it *is* epilepsy or something else.\n      * Express your desire to seek answers and find the most appropriate treatment.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Tests:** Expect the neurologist to order tests to help confirm the diagnosis. These might include:\n\n   * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This is the primary test for epilepsy. It records electrical activity in your brain. Multiple EEGs, sometimes including overnight or ambulatory monitoring, might be needed.\n   * **MRI of the Brain:** This helps to rule out structural problems in the brain that could be causing seizures.\n   * **Blood Tests:** To check for metabolic abnormalities or other factors that could contribute to seizures.\n\n3. **Discuss Medication:**  *Do not* stop taking Lamictal without talking to your doctor.  Abruptly stopping AEDs can be dangerous and can trigger more seizures.  With the neurologist:\n\n   * **Review the Side Effects:**  Discuss the memory problems.  There may be ways to manage them (e.g., adjusting the dosage, adding another medication)\n   * **Explore Alternatives:**  If the side effects are intolerable, ask if there are other AEDs you could try.  There are many different options.\n     * **Potential AED alternatives:** Keppra, Topamax, Tegretol, Zonegran are potential alternative AEDs. However, each drug has distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n   * **Titration Adjustment:** Sometimes, slowly increasing or decreasing the dose can minimize side effects.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Considerations:**\n\n   * **Sleep:**  Get regular, adequate sleep. Sleep deprivation is a common seizure trigger.\n   * **Stress Management:**  Find healthy ways to manage stress.\n   * **Diet:**  Maintain a healthy diet.\n   * **Avoid Triggers:** If you identify any potential triggers, avoid them. (This can be hard to do until you have a clearer diagnosis). Things like excessive caffeine, alcohol, and dehydration might be contributing factors.\n\n5. **Mental Health Support:**  The emotional impact of epilepsy can be significant.\n\n   * **Epilepsy Association of Hong Kong** (https://www.epilepsy.org.hk/): Offer support groups, counselling, and information.  They might also have resources for coping with the social stigma of epilepsy.\n   * **Consider talking to a therapist:** A therapist can help you process your feelings, cope with anxiety or depression, and develop strategies for managing your condition.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **You are not alone.** Epilepsy affects many people, and there's a lot of support available.\n* **Don't be ashamed.**  Seizures are a medical condition, not a sign of weakness or character flaw.\n* **Advocate for yourself.**  Ask questions, express your concerns, and be an active participant in your healthcare.\n* **Carry medical identification.**  This is important in case you have another seizure.\n\n\n\n**To help me tailor the advice even more, could you tell me:**\n\n* **Do you have any family history of epilepsy or seizures?**\n* **Are you currently seeing a GP (General Practitioner)?**\n* **Do you have health insurance?**\n* **Can you describe the memory problems in more detail? (e.g., difficulty remembering recent events, trouble finding words, etc.)**\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "24 F USA Asthma, epilepsy, hypothyroidismI have laryngeal candidiasis (unknown cause but thought to be from Breo and prednisone?) and it isn't responding much to fluconazole. The next step is amphotericin b and I'm kinda nervous. What should I expect realistically?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, let's break down what you're facing with potentially needing Amphotericin B for your laryngeal candidiasis, especially given your medical history. It's good you're asking questions and being proactive; being nervous is completely understandable! Here's a realistic look at what to expect, tailored to your situation, and broken down into sections. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for direct medical advice.**\n\n**1. Understanding the Situation: Why Amphotericin B?**\n\n* **Fluconazole Resistance/Limited Effectiveness:**  Laryngeal candidiasis can be stubborn, and sometimes the fungus develops resistance to fluconazole, or the location (larynx) makes it harder for the drug to reach effective concentrations.\n* **Severity:** The fact that it's not responding much to fluconazole suggests either resistance, a severe infection, or a compromised immune system (which your other conditions could contribute to\u2013explained further below).\n* **Amphotericin B - The Big Gun:** Amphotericin B is a much more potent antifungal. It's often reserved for severe fungal infections or those resistant to other treatments because of its potential side effects.\n* **Your Medical History & Risk Factors:**  Your asthma, epilepsy, and especially hypothyroidism are all relevant. \n    * **Asthma & Prednisone:** Asthma itself doesn't directly increase fungal risk, but *prednisone* (a corticosteroid) absolutely does. Prednisone suppresses the immune system, making you more vulnerable to infections like candidiasis. It also alters the microbiome, potentially allowing *Candida* to overgrow.  The suspicion it\u2019s linked to your candidiasis is logical.\n    * **Epilepsy & Medications:**  Some anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can affect the immune system, but this is less common.\n    * **Hypothyroidism:**  Hypothyroidism can also subtly impact immune function.  Optimizing your thyroid hormone levels is crucial for overall health and immune response.\n\n\n\n**2. What to Expect with Amphotericin B Treatment**\n\nThere are different formulations of Amphotericin B, which impact side effects.  *It's crucial to know WHICH formulation your doctor is prescribing.*  The most common are:\n\n* **Conventional Amphotericin B (Fungizone):** This is the original form, given intravenously (IV). It has the highest risk of side effects.\n* **Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome, Abelcet):** This is encapsulated in liposomes (fatty spheres) which target the drug more to the fungal cells and reduce toxicity.  It's generally preferred when possible, even though it's more expensive.  *AmBisome is generally the one doctors try to use first now.*\n* **Lipid Complex Amphotericin B (Amphocil):** Another lipid-based formulation, falling between conventional and liposomal in terms of toxicity.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of what to expect, categorized by potential side effects. I\u2019ll focus mainly on Liposomal Amphotericin B, as it is the most likely to be used, but also will mention what's different with conventional Amphotericin B.**\n\n* **During the Infusion (Most Common):**\n    * **Fever/Chills:** Very common, even with liposomal formulations.  You'll likely be pre-medicated with acetaminophen or steroids to minimize this.\n    * **Nausea:** Also common. Anti-nausea medication will probably be given.\n    * **Headache:** Occasional.\n    * **Slow Infusion:** The infusion is usually given slowly, over several hours, to minimize side effects.\n    * **With Conventional Amphotericin B:** These reactions are often *much* more pronounced with the conventional form \u2013 higher fever, chills, more severe nausea, and a risk of more serious cardiac effects (see below).\n\n* **Common Side Effects (That Happen After the Infusion, or Develop During Treatment):**\n    * **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Amphotericin B (all formulations) can cause low potassium (hypokalemia) and low magnesium (hypomagnesemia).  *This is very important.* Your electrolytes will be monitored very frequently (usually daily) with blood tests, and you will likely receive potassium and magnesium supplements.  Low electrolytes can cause muscle weakness, heart rhythm problems, and fatigue.\n    * **Kidney Problems:**  All forms can cause kidney damage. Liposomal formulations are *much* less nephrotoxic (kidney-damaging) than conventional Amphotericin B, but it's still a concern.  *Expect regular kidney function tests (BUN, Creatinine).*  Staying well-hydrated during treatment is vital.\n    * **Fatigue:** Very common.  You'll likely feel tired and weak.\n    * **Loss of Appetite:**  Can contribute to weight loss.\n\n* **Less Common, But Serious Side Effects:**   (More likely with conventional Amphotericin B, but still possible with liposomal)\n    * **Cardiac Arrhythmias:**  Irregular heartbeats.  This is rare with liposomal, but more concerning with the conventional form.  An ECG (electrocardiogram) might be done before and during treatment, especially if you have pre-existing heart conditions.\n    * **Anemia:** Low red blood cell count.\n    * **Severe Allergic Reactions:** Rare, but possible.  The infusion staff will be prepared to manage this.\n    * **Thrombophlebitis:**  Inflammation of the vein where the IV is inserted.\n\n\n\n**3. Your Specific Concerns - Asthma, Epilepsy, Hypothyroidism**\n\n* **Asthma:**  Amphotericin B doesn't directly worsen asthma, but any systemic illness can potentially trigger an exacerbation.  Make sure your asthma is well-controlled *before* starting treatment, and have your rescue inhaler readily available.\n* **Epilepsy:**  Electrolyte imbalances (especially low magnesium) can *potentially* lower the seizure threshold.  Close monitoring of electrolytes and communication with your neurologist are essential.  If you experience any changes in your seizure pattern, you *must* inform your doctor immediately.\n* **Hypothyroidism:**  As mentioned earlier, ensuring your thyroid hormone levels are optimal is important for immune function and recovery.  It's likely your doctor will check your TSH and T4 levels.  Inform your doctor of your hypothyroidism and any recent adjustments to your thyroid medication.\n\n**4.  What to Do to Prepare & During Treatment:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink *plenty* of fluids before, during, and after each infusion. This is crucial to protect your kidneys.\n* **Communication:**  *Be very open and honest with your doctor and nurses about all your medications, allergies, and any changes you experience.*  Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions.\n* **Monitoring:** Attend all scheduled blood tests. These are essential to detect and manage side effects.\n* **Report Symptoms:**  Immediately report any of the following:\n    * Fever over 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C)\n    * Chills\n    * Nausea/Vomiting that doesn't improve with medication\n    * Muscle weakness or cramps\n    * Dizziness or lightheadedness\n    * Changes in urination (amount, color)\n    * Chest pain or palpitations\n    * Any new or worsening symptoms.\n* **Medication Review:**  Review all your medications with your doctor and pharmacist to check for potential interactions.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your doctor knows your complete medical history and is best equipped to determine the appropriate course of treatment for your laryngeal candidiasis, taking into account all your individual risk factors.  **This information should not be used to diagnose or treat any medical condition.**\n\n\n\n**To help your doctor, you could also ask them:**\n\n*   \"Which formulation of Amphotericin B are you planning to use, and why?\"\n*   \"What specific electrolyte levels will be monitored, and how often?\"\n*   \"What are the protocols for managing potential side effects?\"\n*  \u201cWhat is the expected duration of treatment?\u201d\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed information is helpful.  I understand this can be scary, but being informed and proactive will empower you to work with your healthcare team for the best possible outcome.  Good luck!"

        "question": "For a bit longer than a year, I've got random cramps in my sleep, I don't have any memories from that event afterwards and I also don't know what happens while it happens (seemingly like still being asleep). The only person that has observed the seizures/attacks is my girlfriend.Also I only get those cramps/seizures/attacks at night in my sleep and I know that I don't have photosensitive epilepsy.She furthermore described the attacks and mentioned that I seem to have trouble breathing and I seem to make weird noises.I was at a neurologist and he prescribed me Antelepsin at first and then Levetiracetam (up to now), which are both a medical substance that I have to take before going to bed. It does help, but it doesn't cure my state.I'm smoking tobacco on a daily basis, drink alcohol sometimes, smoking cannabis on weekends, and very rarely I take LSD in moderate dosages.As of yet I didn't get a real Diagnose, so I wanted to ask the reddit community, because why not giving it a shot right?I really hope someone can help me, mostly because I don't want to cause any more trouble and anxiety to my girlfriend.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly concerning, and you are absolutely right to seek further information and explore possibilities. You're also very considerate of your girlfriend's anxiety \u2013 that speaks volumes.  Let's break down what you've described and look at potential avenues to explore.  I'm going to give you a lot of information, and importantly, **this is not a substitute for medical advice. It's a compilation of things to discuss with your doctors.** I will also highlight areas where your lifestyle might be contributing and should be openly discussed with your neurologist.\n\n**What We Know (From Your Description):**\n\n* **Nocturnal Events:** These happen *only* while you're asleep. This is a crucial piece of information.\n* **Lack of Awareness:** You have no recollection of the events themselves.  This suggests they are happening at a level of consciousness that doesn't form lasting memories.\n* **Observed Symptoms:**  Your girlfriend reports:\n    * **Cramps/Seizures/Attacks:**  The terminology is important (see below).\n    * **Breathing Difficulty:** This is a red flag and needs careful investigation.\n    * **Unusual Noises:**  Further describes altered neurological activity.\n* **Medication Trial:**  You've been on two anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) \u2013 Antelepsin (oxcarbazepine) and currently Levetiracetam.  The fact that they *help* suggests *some* neurological component, but the lack of complete resolution is significant.\n* **Substance Use:** You use tobacco daily, alcohol occasionally, cannabis weekly, and LSD rarely but in moderate doses.\n* **No Diagnosis:** This is the core problem. You need a definitive answer.\n\n\n\n**Let's clarify the terminology:**\n\nYou've used \"cramps,\" \"seizures,\" and \"attacks.\" These aren't interchangeable. While they *can* overlap, understanding the differences is important:\n\n*   **Cramps:**  Usually painful muscle contractions.  While they *can* happen during sleep, they generally don't involve loss of awareness or breathing difficulties.\n*   **Seizures:**  Abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  Seizures have very specific diagnostic criteria based on what *happens* during them (muscle jerking, staring, loss of awareness, etc.).  There are *many* types of seizures.\n*   **Nocturnal Paroxysmal Dystonia:** A specific condition that can appear as violent movements and sounds during sleep, but doesn't always fit neatly into the conventional seizure classifications. Often responds well to certain medications.\n* **Sleep Disorder:** Issues like sleep apnea or parasomnias can mimic seizure activity.\n\n\n**Potential Causes (Discuss These with Your Doctor!):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of possible causes, grouped for clarity. *I'm not diagnosing you; these are possibilities.*\n\n**1. Neurological (Most likely, given the medications you've been prescribed):**\n\n*   **Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy:** This is a common type of epilepsy presenting with brief, often bizarre movements and sounds *during sleep*.  It often doesn\u2019t involve a full loss of consciousness, but can do so.  The fact that the medications are helping makes this a strong possibility.\n*   **Other Epilepsy Syndromes:** There are many other types of epilepsy. The neurologist may need to consider different options if Levetiracetam isn't fully controlling the events.\n*   **Parasomnias:** Complex sleep behaviors that occur during sleep (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, REM sleep behavior disorder).  These *can* sometimes involve movements and vocalizations, and *can* be mistaken for seizures.  These are differentiated by the stage of sleep they occur in and the behavior itself.\n*   **Hypnic Jerks:** Very common, sudden muscle contractions as you fall asleep.  Usually brief and harmless. However, sometimes they *can* be more pronounced.\n\n**2.  Related to Breathing:**\n\n*   **Sleep Apnea:**  Repeated pauses in breathing during sleep.  This can lead to oxygen deprivation, which can trigger abnormal brain activity.  *This is especially important given your girlfriend's observation of breathing difficulty.*  A sleep study is *essential* to rule this out. \n*   **Central Sleep Apnea:** A less common form of sleep apnea where the brain doesn't send the correct signals to breathe.\n\n**3.  Lifestyle Factors (Crucially Important to Discuss Honestly with your Neurologist):**\n\n*   **Alcohol:** Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture and can *lower the seizure threshold*, making seizures more likely.\n*   **Cannabis:**  While some people use cannabis for sleep, it can actually disrupt the deeper stages of sleep and may interact with anti-epileptic medications.  The impact is complex and varies.\n*   **LSD:** LSD is a powerful hallucinogen that can have lasting effects on brain activity. While infrequent use may not be the sole cause, it *could* be a contributing factor and should be explicitly disclosed to your doctor.  It can interact with certain medications.\n*   **Tobacco:** Nicotine is a stimulant and can disrupt sleep.  It can also have cardiovascular effects that might contribute to breathing problems.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Need to Do (Action Steps):**\n\n1.  **Detailed Seizure Diary:** Have your girlfriend keep a *very* detailed diary of each event. Include:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   How long the event lasted (estimate)\n    *   Specifically what she observed (movements, sounds, breathing changes, color changes in your face, etc.)\n    *   Any triggers she notices (stress, specific foods, time of night, etc.)\n2.  **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):** *This is essential!* A sleep study will monitor your brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and muscle movements during sleep.  This can identify sleep apnea, parasomnias, and the stage of sleep during which the events occur.\n3.  **Long-Term EEG Monitoring:** Consider asking your neurologist about prolonged EEG monitoring (video EEG). This involves wearing an EEG cap for 24-72 hours (or even longer) while being video recorded. This can *catch* an event as it's happening, providing a definitive diagnosis.  Important for nocturnal events.\n4. **MRI:** Make sure that you have an updated MRI of your brain.\n5.  **Honest Discussion with Your Neurologist:**  *Be completely open and honest about your substance use.*  Your doctor needs to know about everything to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.  They are there to help, not to judge.  Explain your concerns about causing your girlfriend anxiety.\n6. **Second Opinion:** If you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting, consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist, ideally one specializing in epilepsy or sleep disorders.\n\n\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n* **Don\u2019t stop your medication without talking to your doctor.**\n* **Safety:** Until you have a diagnosis, it's best to avoid activities that could be dangerous if you were to have an event (e.g., swimming alone, driving).\n* **Reassurance for Your Girlfriend:**  Keep the lines of communication open with her.

        "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really complex situation, and it's understandable why you're worried and why witnessing an attack was so frightening. It sounds deeply distressing for both of you. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, potential explanations, what needs to happen next, and how you can support him.  I will preface this with a **disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional medical evaluation and treatment.**\n\n**Understanding What's Happening: Pseudoseizures/Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**\n\nBased on your description, the most likely explanation, given the history and the fact that tests for epilepsy are repeatedly negative, is **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)**. These are often referred to as \"functional neurological symptoms\" or \"conversion disorder,\" although the terminology is evolving.  They *look* like seizures, and can *feel* like seizures to the person experiencing them, but they are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Instead, they are a manifestation of intense psychological distress.\n\nHere's why this fits:\n\n* **Triggered by Anxiety:** The clear link to anxiety, especially needle/medical procedures, is a huge clue.\n* **No Epilepsy Findings:** Repeated negative EEGs and other epilepsy tests are very significant. \n* **Loss of Consciousness:** PNES can *absolutely* involve loss of consciousness.  It's not \"faking\" \u2013 it's a genuine disconnect in the brain's functioning due to emotional overload.\n* **Physical Symptoms:** The kicking, trembling, shaking, and even temporary color changes (like the purple face you observed) are common in PNES. These are *involuntary* movements and responses, not consciously controlled.\n* **History of Trauma/Stress:** The adolescent drug use and ongoing depression/anxiety contribute to a vulnerability.  Even if those experiences don\u2019t seem directly related now, they can create underlying sensitivities.\n* **Description of Experience:** His description of \"the light going out\" and the \"hammering noise\" is consistent with the subjective experience of PNES, often described as feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.\n* **Response to Sedation:** Opioids can temporarily suppress the physical manifestations of PNES, not because they're treating a neurological problem, but because they reduce overall arousal and anxiety.\n\n\n\n**Why the Purple Face?**\n\nThe purple face (cyanosis) is a concerning symptom and *always* warrants medical attention.  There are a few possibilities here:\n\n* **Brief Breathing Difficulty:** During the PNES event, his breathing may have been temporarily impacted, leading to oxygen deprivation and the skin color change.\n* **Vasovagal Response:** Strong anxiety can sometimes trigger a vasovagal syncopation (faint) which can cause a drop in blood pressure and heart rate, leading to cyanosis.\n* **Co-occurring Condition (Less Likely):**  While less likely given prior tests, it\u2019s crucial to rule out underlying cardiovascular or respiratory issues.\n\nThe fact that the blood tests came back normal is reassuring, but it doesn\u2019t completely explain the cyanosis.  This needs to be discussed with a neurologist.\n\n**What Needs to Happen Next \u2013 A Multi-Pronged Approach:**\n\n1. **Neurology Consultation \u2013 Specifically Requesting PNES/Functional Neurological Disorder Evaluation:**  He *needs* to see a neurologist experienced in diagnosing and treating PNES/Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). *Specifically ask for this expertise when you make the appointment.* Not all neurologists are well-versed in this.  They may order a longer-term EEG (sometimes with video monitoring) to definitively rule out subtle seizure activity, but the focus will be on a thorough clinical assessment.\n2. **Psychiatric Review/Medication Management:** His psychiatrist (or a new one if he's unhappy with the current one) needs to re-evaluate his medication. \n    * **Antidepressants/Anxiolytics:** Ensuring he's on the optimal medication for his depression and anxiety is crucial.\n    * **Consideration of Propranolol/Other Beta-Blockers:**  These can help manage the physical symptoms of anxiety (racing heart, trembling) which can contribute to the attacks. *This is a decision for his psychiatrist.*\n3. **Specialized Therapy \u2013 Crucially, *Trauma-Focused* and *Exposure Therapy*:** This is the most important piece.  CBT alone isn't enough. He needs:\n    * **Exposure Therapy (with a skilled therapist):**  This is where he *gradually* confronts his fear of needles and medical procedures in a safe and controlled environment.  Starting with less anxiety-provoking steps (e.g., looking at pictures of needles, then touching a training needle, then being in the same room as someone getting a shot) all the way up to eventual, planned, medical procedures.  *The previous CBT that only involved a blood draw wasn't intensive enough.*\n    * **Trauma-Informed Therapy:** Explore past experiences that may be contributing to the anxiety and the way it manifests. (EMDR, Somatic Experiencing are good modalities)\n    * **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) specific therapy:** There are physiotherapists and psychologists that specialise in FND and can teach him ways to manage his symptoms.\n4. **Cardiac/Respiratory Workup (Possibly):** Given the episode with the purple face, the neurologist may recommend a cardiology workup (ECG, possibly an echocardiogram) and/or pulmonary function tests to rule out any underlying issues.\n\n\n\n**How You Can Support Him:**\n\n* **Education:** Learn as much as you can about PNES/FND. The more you understand, the better equipped you'll be to support him. (Resources listed at the end.)\n* **Validate His Experience:** *Never* tell him it\u2019s \u201call in his head\u201d or that he\u2019s \u201cmaking it up.\u201d  PNES is a *real* condition with *real* suffering.  Say things like, \"That sounds incredibly scary,\" or \"I can see how much distress this is causing you.\"\n* **Be Calm During Attacks:** During an attack, stay calm.  Remove any hazards from around him. *Do not restrain him.* (This can actually make things worse.)  Time the attack and note what happened before, during, and after. Gently reassure him that it will pass.\n* **Encourage Therapy:** Be supportive of his therapy journey and help him stay motivated.\n* **Help with Exposure Therapy:**  If appropriate and with the therapist\u2019s guidance, you can assist with exposure exercises.\n* **Self-Care:**  Witnessing these episodes is traumatic for you too.  Make sure you\u2019re taking care of your own mental and emotional well-being.  Consider seeking support from a therapist or support group.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **FND Hope International:** [https://www.fndhope.org/](https://www.fndhope.org/)\n* **NeuroSymptoms.org:** [https://www.neurosymptoms.org/](https://www.neurosymptoms.org/)\n* **The Functional Neurology Center:** [https://functionalneurologycenter.net/](https://functionalneurologycenter.net/) - (Information & resources)\n* **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) on PNES:** [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/psychogenic-non-epileptic-seizures](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/psychogenic-non-epileptic-seizures)\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **Don't try to diagnose or treat him yourself.** This is for a healthcare professional.\n* **Advocate for him.**  Sometimes, people with PNES face skepticism from the medical community. Be prepared to advocate for his needs.\n* **Be patient.** Treatment can take time and effort.\n\n\n\nI hope this comprehensive response is helpful.  It's a tough situation, but with the right diagnosis and treatment, he can learn to manage his symptoms and live a fuller life. Good luck to both of you, and please encourage him to pursue the recommended medical and therapeutic evaluations."

        "question": "A few days ago I noticed brain zaps when falling asleep (starts in brain and shocks the rest of my body, then spreads to my tongue and leaves it numb for a few seconds).I thought it was from my medication (Straterra) because I was bad about taking it daily for a couple of months but finally got into a routine (I have been taking Straterra for 5 years). My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is definitely something you're right to be investigating, and it's good your doctor is taking it seriously with the MRI order.  The sensations you describe \u2013 the \"brain zaps\" radiating down your body and causing tongue numbness \u2013 are concerning, and it's wise to rule out serious causes.  Let's break down possibilities, considering your history, and then address the seriousness point.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is *not* medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Symptoms: Brain Zaps & Numbness**\n\nThese sensations often feel like a very brief electrical shock within the head, sometimes with a radiating sensation.  The tongue numbness adds another layer of complexity.  Here\u2019s what\u2019s going through a clinician's mind when hearing this:\n\n*   **Neurological Origin:**  Because of the shock-like quality and spread, a neurological source is the primary suspicion. This isn\u2019t necessarily a disaster scenario, but definitely needs investigation.\n*   **Sensory vs. Motor/Electrical:** It's important to differentiate if this is truly an electrical sensation (like a small seizure or nerve misfire) or a strong *perception* of one. Your history of non-epileptic seizures is key here.\n*   **Timing (Falling Asleep):** The fact they happen *as you fall asleep* is a very important piece of the puzzle. This suggests something happening during the transition from wakefulness to sleep.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes - Considering Your History**\n\nGiven your background, here's a breakdown of possibilities, from more common to less common, and how relevant they are to your situation.  I'll categorize them:\n\n**1. Medication-Related (Though your doctor is skeptical \u2013 and rightly so)**\n\n*   **Strattera (Atomoxetine) Discontinuation/Fluctuations:**  While your doctor said it's unusual after 5 years of stable use, *sudden* changes in neurotransmitter levels (especially norepinephrine, which Strattera affects) *can* theoretically cause these sensations, even after being on the medication a long time. If your adherence wasn't perfect, there might be some fluctuation. It's good that you're now consistent with it.\n*   **Other Medications/Supplements:** Are you taking anything *new*, even over-the-counter supplements? Interactions are possible.\n*   **Medication Metabolism:** Variations in how your body processes the medication *could* play a role, though this is less likely after 5 years.\n\n**2. Neurological Conditions (Important given your history)**\n\n*   **Seizure Activity (Even Subtle):**  You have a history of non-epileptic seizures. While you describe these as *non*-epileptic, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s underlying electrical instability in the brain.  A brief, focal seizure (affecting a small part of the brain) *could* manifest as these sensations, especially during the sleep transition. This is why the MRI is crucial.  It needs to be determined if it's a different type of seizure or still a non-epileptic event.\n*   **Migraine with Aura:**  Some migraine auras can present with unusual sensory symptoms. However, migraine typically involves headache, which you haven't mentioned.\n*   **Sensory Neuropathy:**  This involves nerve damage that can cause unusual sensations like tingling, numbness, and even brief, shooting pains.  It's less likely to cause the \u2018zap\u2019 sensation precisely, but the numbness is a connection.\n*   **MS (Multiple Sclerosis):**  While usually presenting with more consistent symptoms, early MS can sometimes have atypical presentations. This is one reason an MRI is important to rule it out.  However, given your age, it's less probable than some other causes.\n\n**3. Other possibilities**\n\n*   **Hypnic Jerks:** These are sudden, involuntary muscle contractions that occur as you fall asleep.  Sometimes they can be accompanied by a sensation of falling or a flash of light. While typically not 'zaps,' a particularly strong one *could* be interpreted that way. Typically don\u2019t cause tongue numbness.\n* **Anxiety/Stress:**  High levels of anxiety or stress can sometimes manifest in physical symptoms, including unusual sensations. Your history of OCD and ADHD suggests potential for anxiety.  However, this is usually a diagnosis of exclusion \u2013 meaning other causes need to be ruled out first.\n* **Vitamin Deficiencies:** Certain deficiencies (like B12, or magnesium) can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. A blood test can rule this out.\n\n\n\n\n**Is This Serious?**\n\n**Yes, it needs to be taken seriously.** The fact that these sensations are new, and affect your tongue, warrants a full investigation.  Your doctor is right to order an MRI.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n*   **Ruling out Structural Problems:** The MRI will look for any structural abnormalities in your brain \u2013 tumors, lesions (like those seen in MS), or other issues that could be causing the sensations.\n*   **Identifying Seizure Activity:** While an MRI can't *see* seizures happening, it can show evidence of areas in the brain that are prone to them or have been affected by them.\n*   **Peace of Mind:** Even if the MRI is normal, it will significantly reduce anxiety and allow you and your doctor to explore other possibilities.\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n1.  **Get the MRI:**  Schedule it as soon as possible.\n2.  **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Record *exactly* when these events occur:\n    *   Time of day\n    *   What you were doing beforehand (e.g., lying in bed, reading, etc.)\n    *   Specific sensations (the \u2018zap\u2019 location, the type of numbness, how long it lasts)\n    *   Any potential triggers (stress, fatigue, etc.)\n3. **Discuss with your Doctor:** Bring your symptom diary to your appointment. Be as specific as possible.   Ask what the next steps will be after the MRI.\n4. **Consider a Neurology Referral:** If your primary care doctor isn't specifically a neurologist, ask for a referral to one after the MRI results are in.  A neurologist is best equipped to interpret the MRI and manage any neurological concerns.\n5.  **Avoid Sudden Medication Changes:** Don't adjust your Strattera dosage without talking to your doctor.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

I know it\u2019s scary to experience new neurological symptoms, but you\u2019re doing the right thing by getting it checked out.  Good luck with the MRI, and I hope you get answers soon."

But the Motor Tics medicine isn't doing any good to me so the doc was thinking about Myoclonic Epilepsy. But my MRI report is fine? Do i still need to worry? I have ADHD, Panic attacks and Anxiety Disorder problems and even normal MRI is killing me inside why am i having those jerks!?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're understandably incredibly anxious, and it's great you're reaching out and providing detailed information.  Let's break down your situation, addressing your concerns about the MRI, the jerks, your diagnoses, and your overall anxiety.  I'll provide a detailed response, but **please read the disclaimer at the end because I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.**\n\n**1. Understanding Your MRI Result: \"Normal\" Doesn't Always Mean \"Nothing\"**\n\nYou are right to question why you're still experiencing symptoms with a \"normal\" MRI.  \"Normal\" in MRI reporting means *no structural abnormalities were detected*.  It does **not** rule out all possible causes of your jerks. Think of it like this:\n\n*   **MRI looks for physical changes:**  It's excellent at showing things like tumors, strokes, lesions (damage) in the brain, or structural abnormalities.  Your report explicitly states that those aren't present.\n*   **MRI doesn't show everything:** It does *not* directly visualize things like:\n    *   **Electrical activity:**  Epilepsy is an *electrical* problem, not necessarily a structural one.  An MRI might show scarring *after* someone has had multiple seizures, but it's often normal *before* or between seizures.  Some types of epilepsy don't leave visible marks on an MRI.\n    *   **Neurochemical imbalances:**  Conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and even some movement disorders can involve imbalances in brain chemicals that aren't visible on an MRI.\n    *   **Functional issues:** How different parts of your brain *communicate* with each other. Functional MRI (fMRI) can look at this, but a standard MRI doesn't.\n\n**2. Your Symptoms & The Differential Diagnosis (Myoclonus vs. Tics)**\n\nYour doctor is wisely considering both myoclonus and tics, and it's good they're re-evaluating, especially since the tic medication isn\u2019t working. Let's clarify:\n\n*   **Myoclonus:** Brief, involuntary, sudden muscle jerks. They can be single or repetitive. They often feel like a shock or a ripple under the skin.  They can happen at rest or with movement.  *Many* things can cause myoclonus - sleep deprivation, stress, caffeine, medications, metabolic issues (like thyroid problems), and neurological conditions (including different types of epilepsy).\n*   **Tics:**  Sudden, repetitive, *non-rhythmic* movements or vocalizations.  People with tics often feel a premonitory urge or sensation before the tic, and they can sometimes suppress them (though suppressing them can be uncomfortable). Tics are strongly associated with neurological conditions like Tourette's Syndrome, but can also occur in other conditions or independently.\n\n**Why the tic medication isn\u2019t working is key.** If it's not responding, it points *away* from a primary tic disorder and strengthens the possibility of something else, like myoclonus, or a different underlying cause.\n\n**3. Your Existing Diagnoses \u2013 How They Interplay**\n\nYour various diagnoses (hypertension, hypothyroidism, pre-diabetes, ADHD, anxiety disorder, panic attacks) are *all* relevant:\n\n*   **Hypothyroidism:** Can cause muscle weakness, cramping, and in some cases, myoclonus.  *Is your thyroid medication properly adjusted?*  Getting your levels optimized is very important.\n*   **Hypertension:**  While less directly linked to jerks, uncontrolled hypertension can affect blood flow to the brain and potentially contribute to neurological symptoms.\n*   **Pre-diabetes:** Associated with nerve damage (neuropathy) over time, which can sometimes cause muscle twitching or jerks.\n*   **ADHD:**  Can present with restlessness and fidgeting that *could* be mistaken for tics or myoclonus, *especially* if the anxiety is high.  The medication for ADHD can also sometimes have side effects that include movement-related symptoms.\n*   **Anxiety/Panic Attacks:** This is hugely important.  Anxiety and panic can *absolutely* cause muscle tension, tremors, and jerks.  Hyperventilation during a panic attack can also disrupt electrolyte balance, which can contribute to muscle issues.  The *fear* of the jerks themselves can increase anxiety, creating a vicious cycle.\n\n**4. What Should You Do Next? (Recommendations)**\n\nGiven the normal MRI, lack of response to tic medication, and your complex medical history, here's a suggested approach:\n\n*   **Detailed Neurological Exam:**  A thorough examination by a neurologist is crucial. They'll assess:\n    *   The *characteristics* of your jerks:  Where do they occur? How frequent? Are they symmetrical? What triggers them?\n    *   Your reflexes, coordination, strength, and sensation.\n    *   Your mental status and cognitive function.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** *This is the most important next step if epilepsy is still a concern.* An EEG measures electrical activity in your brain. It can detect abnormal patterns that suggest epilepsy, even if the MRI is normal.  You might need a prolonged EEG (24-72 hours) or even an ambulatory EEG (where you wear a device for several days to record activity during your normal life) to capture events.\n*   **Blood Tests:**\n    *   **Complete Metabolic Panel:**  To check electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) and kidney function.  Imbalances can cause myoclonus.\n    *   **Thyroid Function Tests (TSH, Free T4, Free T3):**  To ensure your hypothyroidism is well-controlled.\n    *   **Vitamin D Levels:**  Vitamin D deficiency can sometimes contribute to muscle symptoms.\n    *   **Possibly other tests:** Your doctor might order additional tests based on your specific symptoms and history.\n*   **Review Medications:**  Discuss all your medications (including supplements) with your doctor. Some medications can cause or worsen myoclonus.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Prioritize getting enough sleep.  Sleep deprivation can worsen many of your symptoms.\n*   **Stress Management:**  This is critical. Techniques like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, yoga, or meditation can help manage anxiety and reduce muscle tension.  Consider therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013 CBT \u2013 is often very effective for anxiety and panic attacks).\n\n**5. Addressing Your Anxiety About the Normal MRI**\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that a normal MRI hasn\u2019t brought you relief. You\u2019ve been experiencing something distressing, and you wanted a clear answer.  The fact that the MRI is normal is *good* \u2013 it rules out many serious possibilities!  But it also means the investigation needs to continue to find the true cause.\n\n*   **Focus on the process:** Instead of fixating on having \u201csomething wrong,\u201d focus on actively participating in the diagnostic process.  Ask your doctor questions, keep a detailed symptom diary, and be patient.\n*   **Accept uncertainty:** Sometimes, the cause of symptoms isn\u2019t immediately clear.  Learning to cope with uncertainty is a key part of managing anxiety.\n*   **Challenge negative thoughts:**  When you find yourself spiraling with worry, try to challenge those thoughts.  For example, instead of thinking \"This is terrible, I must have something seriously wrong,\" try \"The MRI was normal, which is reassuring.  I'm working with my doctor to figure this out.\"\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Do not delay seeking professional medical advice because of something you have read here.\n\n\n\nTo help me understand your situation better (though still *not* a substitute for medical advice), could you tell me:\n\n*   **Can you describe the jerks in more detail?**  Where do they happen on your body?  Are they sudden and shocking, or more gradual?  Are they triggered by anything specific?\n*   **When did the jerks start?**  Was there anything happening in your life at the time (stressful event, change in medication, illness)?\n*   **How is your anxiety currently managed?** Are you in therapy, taking medication, or using other coping strategies?\n*   **What tic medication have you tried, and for how long?**\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful.  Take a deep breath, and remember you're taking steps to understand what's going on and get the care you need."

        "question": "The other day I didn't use the dosage cup and just swallowed some Pepto-Bismol Max. I guess it was maybe a mouthful? I don't know how much that is but it felt like a \"large swallow\". Maybe as much as the max daily dosage of 120mL. That was all I had for at least 24 hours in either direction.I don't think I feel any symptoms different than what I usually feel. I read that toxicity can cause confusion and ringing in the ears. But I always seem to have ringing in the ears from time to time, and I have epilepsy so I'm always a little tired and confused (I take carbamazapine 300mg 2x).How concerned should I be? 28 year old white male. About 160lbs and 5'6",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, let's break this down and address your concerns. You've taken a potentially larger-than-recommended dose of Pepto-Bismol Max, and have some complicating factors with your existing health conditions. Here's a comprehensive look at what to consider, and what steps you should take.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response as it is very important.**\n\n**1. Understanding the Situation: Bismuth Subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol Max)**\n\n*   **Active Ingredient:** Pepto-Bismol Max contains bismuth subsalicylate.  The main concerns with *overdosing* on bismuth subsalicylate are related to *salicylate* toxicity, which is similar to aspirin overdose.\n*   **Max Daily Dose:** You correctly state the max daily dose is 120mL (or 240mL for Pepto-Bismol liquid, which has a lower concentration).  A \"mouthful\" is very imprecise, and the amount could vary greatly, but fearing it was close to 120mL is reasonable given your description.\n*   **Symptoms of Salicylate Toxicity:** You're right to mention confusion and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).  Other symptoms can include:\n    *   Nausea, vomiting\n    *   Rapid breathing\n    *   Dizziness\n    *   Sweating\n    *   Severe cases:  Seizures, altered mental status, coma.\n* **Bismuth Toxicity:** While less common with a single overdose, prolonged or very high doses of bismuth can cause a bluish discoloration of the gums, tongue, and stool, and rarely neurological problems.\n\n**2. Your Specific Concerns & Considerations**\n\n*   **Epilepsy & Carbamazepine:**  This is *very* important.\n    *   **Salicylates and Seizure Threshold:** Salicylates (like in Pepto-Bismol) can *lower* the seizure threshold. This means it takes less stimulation to trigger a seizure. *This is a heightened risk for someone with epilepsy.*\n    *   **Carbamazepine Interaction:**  While there isn't a direct, major interaction between bismuth subsalicylate and carbamazepine, any substance that impacts your neurological system (like a salicylate overdose) *could* potentially interact and affect your seizure control or make it harder to interpret changes in your baseline.\n*   **Pre-Existing Tinnitus & Confusion:**  You've rightly identified this. Since you *already* experience tinnitus and some degree of confusion due to your epilepsy and medication, it's harder to definitively say if any new symptoms are *from* the Pepto-Bismol or from your baseline condition. This makes assessment trickier.\n*   **Single Dose vs. Chronic Use:** You had this single instance of a potentially high dose, with no exposure in the 24 hours before or after. This is somewhat reassuring, as chronic use is what typically leads to more serious bismuth accumulation.\n* **Weight and Height:** Your weight of 160lbs is within the normal range, so you're not unusually sensitive from a weight perspective. Your height of 5'6\" is relevant in calculating potential dosages.\n\n**3.  Level of Concern & What You Should Do *Now***\n\nBased on the information you've provided, I would recommend you **contact a medical professional as soon as possible**.  Here's why and what to consider:\n\n*   **The Epilepsy is the Key:** The biggest concern is the potential for lowered seizure threshold. It\u2019s important to get expert advice given your history.\n*   **Uncertain Dosage:** The fact that you don't know the exact amount taken is problematic. It's better to err on the side of caution.\n*   **Difficulty Interpreting Symptoms:**  Your existing conditions make it hard to tell if any changes you're feeling are related to the Pepto-Bismol.\n\n**Here are your options for medical contact (listed in order of recommendation):**\n\n1.  **Call Your Neurologist:**  This is the *best* first step. They know your epilepsy and medication, and can best assess the risk in your specific case. They might want to see you.\n2.  **Call Your Primary Care Physician:**  If you can't reach your neurologist quickly, your PCP is the next best option.\n3.  **Contact Poison Control:**  In the US, call 1-800-222-1222.  They are available 24/7 and can provide expert advice based on the substance, amount, and your medical history. They can help you determine if you need to go to the emergency room.  They will ask for details about the dose and your symptoms.\n4.  **Emergency Room (if needed):** If you develop *any* of the following, go to the ER immediately:\n    *   New or worsening confusion\n    *   Severe headache\n    *   Rapid breathing\n    *   Seizure activity\n    *   Vomiting that won't stop\n    *   Any other significant change in your mental or physical state\n\n**When you contact a medical professional, be prepared to provide:**\n\n*   The name of the medication (Pepto-Bismol Max)\n*   The approximate amount you think you took.\n*   The time you took it.\n*   Your medical history (epilepsy, carbamazepine dose, any other medical conditions).\n*   A detailed description of *any* symptoms you're experiencing, even if you think they might be normal for you. Be very specific about if *anything* has changed.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  The risk of lowered seizure threshold with salicylate ingestion in someone with epilepsy is a serious concern that requires professional assessment.  Do not delay seeking medical attention."

        "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a truly terrifying and frustrating situation. You're right to be desperate for answers and support. It sounds like you've been incredibly thorough in seeking medical attention, and the lack of a diagnosis is understandably devastating. Here's a breakdown of thoughts, potential avenues to explore, and suggestions, focusing on getting the right kind of investigation.  I'll also address some of the vaccine connection concerns.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response. I am not a medical professional and this is not a substitute for medical advice.**\n\n**1. The Importance of Catching an Event on Camera & Demanding Real-Time Monitoring:**\n\nThis is the *most* crucial point. You've hit the nail on the head about the need for examination *during* an attack. The fact that doctors aren\u2019t prioritizing this is a significant concern.\n\n*   **Video Recording:**  Start recording *every* attack.  This isn't about \"proof\" for anyone, it's about providing the doctors with the *actual* physiological events unfolding.  Focus on her breathing, body movements, eye movements (are eyes open/closed, rolling?), color changes, and the entire progression.  Even shaky footage is better than nothing.\n*   **Ambulance on Standby:**  When you go to a doctor (especially a neurologist) explain the history and insist on having an ambulance on standby or being able to quickly call one in if an event occurs during the consultation.\n*   **Prolonged EEG Monitoring (Video-EEG):** This is vital. A standard EEG only captures brain activity for a short time. *Video-EEG monitoring* records brain activity *and* video simultaneously over a period of *days*. This significantly increases the chance of capturing an event and correlating it with brain activity.  Push for this.  You may need to go to a specialized epilepsy center for this (see Section 4).\n*   **Loop Recorder:** Discuss with a cardiologist the possibility of a loop recorder.  This is a small device implanted under the skin that continuously records heart rhythm.  It could detect arrhythmias leading up to or during the events.\n*   **Tilt Table Test:** Given the fainting and potential for orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure drop upon standing), a tilt table test is worth revisiting or specifically requesting.  Ensure it's a *full* tilt table test evaluating both heart rate and blood pressure response.\n\n**2.  Considering Potential Diagnoses (Beyond Epilepsy/Narcolepsy):**\n\nWhile epilepsy and narcolepsy have been ruled out (or not yet confirmed), there are other possibilities, some rarer, that should be explored:\n\n*   **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):**  POTS affects blood flow and can cause fainting, dizziness, and a variety of other symptoms. It's often triggered by physical exertion and can be worsened by dehydration (given her reduced eating/drinking).\n*   **Vasovagal Syncope (with Atypical Features):**  While she\u2019s experienced fainting, the associated symptoms suggest something more complex than \"simple\" vasovagal syncope.  But it needs to be fully investigated.\n*   **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Even if initial heart tests were normal, intermittent arrhythmias can be missed.  A prolonged heart monitoring (Holter monitor for several days, or a loop recorder) might catch them.\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This diagnosis should be one of exclusion and made by an expert, *after* all other organic causes have been thoroughly investigated.  It involves neurological symptoms (like weakness, movement problems, and seizures) that are not caused by structural damage to the nervous system but by problems with how the brain functions. *Crucially, this does not mean it's \"psychological\" \u2013 it's a real neurological condition.*\n*   **Mitochondrial Disorders:** These are rare genetic disorders that affect energy production in cells. They can present with a wide range of symptoms, including neurological problems and fainting.\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:** A broader category encompassing POTS and other conditions where the autonomic nervous system (which controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing) is not functioning properly.\n* **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):** This syndrome can cause a wide array of symptoms, including fainting, dizziness, gastrointestinal issues, and neurological symptoms, due to the release of mediators from mast cells.\n\n**3.  Addressing the Vaccine Connection (Carefully):**\n\nYou're right to be cautious about attributing this *directly* to the vaccine, but the temporal relationship is undeniably important.  It's not necessarily a simple cause-and-effect, but the vaccine may have *triggered* an underlying predisposition or autoimmune response.\n\n*   **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS):**  Even if you don't believe the vaccine *caused* this, formally reporting the events to VAERS is important. This helps track potential adverse events and identify patterns. [https://vaers.hhs.gov/](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)\n*   **Autoimmune Workup:**  Request a comprehensive autoimmune panel.  The vaccine could potentially have triggered an autoimmune response that's affecting the nervous system or other organs.\n* **Inflammation Markers:** Ask your doctor to check for elevated inflammatory markers in her blood. These could indicate an underlying inflammatory process contributing to her symptoms.\n\n**4.  Finding the Right Doctors/Centers:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Center:**  Even if epilepsy is unlikely, a comprehensive epilepsy center has the equipment and expertise for advanced monitoring (Video-EEG) and diagnosis of complex neurological events. Search here: [https://www.epilepsy.com/centers](https://www.epilepsy.com/centers)\n*   **Autonomic Specialist:**  If POTS or other autonomic dysfunction is suspected, seek out a physician specializing in autonomic disorders.\n*   **Neurologist with Expertise in Movement Disorders:**  The subtle convulsions warrant a neurologist experienced in movement disorders.\n*   **Cardiologist:** For the heart, a cardiologist familiar with arrhythmias and autonomic dysfunction is important.\n* **Immunologist/Allergist:** To explore potential autoimmune or MCAS involvement.\n*   **Advocate/Patient Navigator:**  Consider hiring a patient advocate or navigator to help you navigate the medical system, coordinate appointments, and advocate for your girlfriend's needs.\n\n\n\n**5.  Practical Support for Your Girlfriend (and You):**\n\n*   **Hydration:** Encourage small, frequent sips of water, even if she can't eat much.\n*   **Electrolyte Balance:**  Talk to a doctor about electrolyte supplements (carefully, given her medication sensitivity).\n*   **Diet:**  Work with a nutritionist who understands her condition to ensure she's getting adequate calories and nutrients, even in small amounts.\n* **Stress Management:** While she doesn't have diagnosed anxiety, the chronic stress of this illness is significant.  Gentle relaxation techniques can help.\n*   **Your Wellbeing:** This is immensely stressful for you too. Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. You can't help her if you're burned out.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

This problem has started only around a month ago but it happens almost every other day. I don\u2019t know What is going on , should I be concerned?Edit: I do want to add that I do eat a lot of salt in my diet and I have been like this for long time.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds concerning, and you are right to be asking questions and considering seeking medical attention. Let's break down the information you've provided and discuss potential causes, what you should do, and why. I will preface this with a **very important disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**What's Happening (Based on your description):**\n\nYou're experiencing episodes of what sounds like **presyncope** (the feeling *before* fainting) or potentially even **syncope** (actual fainting, even if you don't fully lose consciousness, the temporary vision loss is significant). The key symptoms are:\n\n*   **Dizziness:** A feeling of being lightheaded, unsteady, or that the room is spinning.\n*   **Heat Sensation:** Feeling flushed or hot.\n*   **Visual Disturbances:** Seeing stars, then complete temporary vision loss (\"blacking out\").\n*   **Postural Dependence:**  Symptoms significantly improve when lying down or sitting.\n*   **Frequency:** Happening almost every other day for the last month.\n*   **Associated Symptoms:** Anxiety, heart palpitations, fluctuating weight.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes (Important: This is not a diagnosis, just a list of possibilities to discuss with a doctor):**\n\nGiven your history and details, several things could be contributing. Here's a breakdown, from more likely to less, but *all* need investigation:\n\n1.  **Orthostatic Hypotension (Postural Hypotension):** This is a *very* common cause, *especially* given your weight, dietary habits, and potential for dehydration. It happens when your blood pressure drops suddenly when you stand up.  Your body struggles to quickly adjust to gravity, reducing blood flow to the brain. Your salt intake actually complicates this - while salt *can* help *some* people with low blood pressure, it can also *cause* fluid retention initially, potentially *masking* underlying low blood volume issues.  Then, when your body adjusts, the blood pressure can drop.\n     * **Why it connects to your symptoms:** Explains the dizziness, heat, vision changes when standing, and relief when lying down.\n2.  **Dehydration:**  If you're not drinking enough fluids, especially given potential anxiety impacting your appetite, you could be chronically mildly dehydrated.  Dehydration lowers blood volume, exacerbating orthostatic hypotension.\n3.  **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a common cause of fainting, often triggered by emotional stress (like anxiety), pain, or prolonged standing. It involves a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure.\n     * **Why it connects to your symptoms:** Your anxiety and heart palpitations suggest this could be a factor.\n4. **Epilepsy & Keppra:** While you've been stable on Keppra for 3 years, it's *always* worth mentioning any new symptoms to your neurologist.  In rare cases, medication side effects can change over time, or the epilepsy itself could be manifesting in new ways.  (Though the symptoms you describe are less typical for seizures.)\n5.  **Cardiac Issues:**  While less likely at your age, a heart rhythm problem or structural heart issue could be causing reduced blood flow to the brain.\n6. **Anemia:**  Low iron levels can cause fatigue, dizziness, and weakness.\n7. **Dietary factors:** Fluctuations in blood sugar due to inconsistent eating can definitely cause dizziness and lightheadedness. You also mention high salt intake along with alcohol consumption, which can cause dehydration. \n\n**Regarding your specific details:**\n\n*   **Weight Fluctuations:**  A 10-pound swing each week is significant. This could be due to fluid retention (related to salt intake?), changes in eating patterns, or other factors and warrants discussion with a doctor.\n*   **Anxiety & Eating:**  The connection between anxiety and your appetite is important. Anxiety significantly impacts the nervous system and can cause physical symptoms.\n*   **High Salt Intake:** This is a *key* point.  As mentioned earlier, it can be a double-edged sword.  It *might* be contributing to fluid shifts and blood pressure instability, particularly when combined with alcohol.\n* **Alcohol Consumption:** 3 times a week is not *extremely* heavy drinking, but alcohol is a diuretic (makes you pee more) and can contribute to dehydration. It can also interact with Keppra, although the interaction is generally not severe.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do (and in what order):**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor \u2013 ASAP:** This is *not* something to ignore.  You need a medical evaluation.  Start with your primary care physician. Explain all of your symptoms in detail. Be honest about your diet, alcohol consumption, anxiety, and medications.\n2. **Keep a Symptom Diary:** For a week or so before your appointment, keep a detailed record of:\n    *   **Time of day symptoms occur**\n    *   **What you were doing before symptoms started** (e.g., standing, walking, after eating, during stressful situations)\n    *   **What you ate and drank in the hours before**\n    *   **How long the symptoms last**\n    *   **What, if anything, relieves the symptoms.**\n3.  **Hydrate:**  Start consciously increasing your water intake *today*. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n4.  **Moderate Salt Intake:**  This is difficult if you enjoy salty foods, but *try* to reduce it. Start gradually.  Reduce adding extra salt to your food, and be mindful of high-sodium snacks/foods like olives and pickles.\n5. **Moderate Alcohol Consumption:** Consider reducing alcohol intake to see if it makes a difference.\n6.  **Neurologist Follow-up:**  Inform your neurologist about these new symptoms at your next scheduled appointment.\n\n\n\n**Tests Your Doctor May Order:**\n\n*   **Physical Exam:**  Including blood pressure and heart rate measurements while lying down, sitting, and standing (orthostatic blood pressure).\n*   **Blood Tests:**  Complete blood count (to check for anemia), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, etc.), kidney function, and possibly thyroid function.\n*   **ECG/EKG:** To check your heart rhythm.\n*   **Holter Monitor:**  A portable ECG that records your heart rhythm over 24-48 hours.\n*   **Tilt Table Test:** A more specialized test used to evaluate orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope.\n*  **EEG:** Your neurologist might want to repeat an EEG to make sure your epilepsy is still well controlled.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\n*I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.*  Your symptoms could have a serious underlying cause, and self-treating is not advisable.  It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis from a doctor.\n\n\n\nPlease, don't delay seeking medical help.  It's better to be safe and get these symptoms checked out. I hope you get answers soon and feel better!"

I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a tough situation and it's good you're proactively researching options. Refractory epilepsy is incredibly frustrating, and it's smart to explore everything before committing to a surgical path. You're right to be skeptical of things that *sound* too good to be true, but also wise to keep an open mind. Here's a breakdown of your situation, some well-regarded alternative/adjunct options, and a discussion of the ones you mentioned \u2013 plus things to discuss with your neurologist.  I'll aim to cover a lot of ground.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding Your Situation (Key Points)**\n\n* **Refractory Epilepsy:** This means two or more anti-seizure medications (ASMs) have failed to control your seizures. That's the defining characteristic.\n* **Unknown Origin/EMU:** The fact that the origin is still being determined is crucial.  An EEG monitoring unit (EMU) evaluation is essential to pinpoint the seizure focus, which will hugely influence surgical options and generally inform treatment.\n* **Current Meds:** Lamotrigine and Zonisamide are both good ASMs, but their effectiveness varies greatly person to person.\n* **Lifestyle Modifications:**  You've already taken proactive steps, which is very positive. \n* **Frequency:** Seizures every other month, while not constant, are still impactful and impairing, justifying further investigation.\n* **Surgical Discussion:**  Laser ablation (laser surgery) and VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation) are common next steps, but you're right to explore *everything* before committing.\n\n\n\n**Beyond Laser Surgery and VNS: Options to Discuss with Your Neurologist**\n\nThese are generally viewed as having *some* evidence (ranging from strong to limited) for helping in certain epilepsy cases. *Discuss all of these with your neurologist before starting anything.*\n\n**1.  Pharmacological Adjustments (First Line)**\n\n* **ASM Titration/Optimization:** Is there room to adjust the doses of your current medications (within safe limits)? Sometimes, subtle dose adjustments can make a difference.  Your neurologist will monitor for side effects, of course.\n* **Adding a Third ASM:** While adding more drugs has risks (more side effects, drug interactions), it's often tried before surgery.  Newer ASMs may have different mechanisms of action than what you're currently taking.  Consider:\n    *   **Brivaracetam:** Often well-tolerated, can be effective for focal seizures.\n    *   **Perampanel:**  Unique mechanism of action. Useful in some refractory cases. Side effects can be more prominent.\n    *   **Cannabidiol (CBD):** (Epidiolex) specifically approved for certain epilepsy syndromes (like Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut), but can sometimes be used off-label for other refractory epilepsies.  *Important: quality control is vital with CBD products.* Talk to your neurologist about appropriate sourcing.\n*   **Dietary Therapies (Beyond general modification):**\n    *   **Ketogenic Diet:** Very high-fat, very low-carb diet.  Can be incredibly effective for some, but *extremely* restrictive and requires strict medical supervision (specifically a ketogenic dietitian). Can be hard to maintain long-term.\n    * **Modified Atkins Diet:** Less restrictive than Keto.  Also requires strict medical supervision\n    * **Low Glycemic Index Treatment(LGIT):** Less restrictive than Keto/Atkins, but still requires a specialized dietician.\n\n**2.  Neuromodulation (Less Invasive than Surgery)**\n\n*   **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):** A device implanted in the brain that detects abnormal electrical activity and delivers small bursts of stimulation to disrupt seizures *as they start*.   It's personalized to your specific seizure pattern.  Requires careful patient selection.\n* **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**  Involves implanting electrodes into specific brain areas. It's used less often for epilepsy than RNS but can be an option for certain seizure types and locations.\n\n\n\n**3.  Lifestyle and Complementary Approaches (Adjunctive - *with* medical supervision)**\n\n*   **Stress Management:**  Stress is a known seizure trigger for many. Techniques like meditation, mindfulness, yoga, or therapy can be beneficial.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Poor sleep is also a strong trigger.  Consistent sleep schedules, a dark/quiet bedroom, and avoiding caffeine before bed are helpful.\n*   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity (within your limits) can improve overall health and potentially reduce seizure frequency.\n*   **Biofeedback:**  Can help you learn to control certain bodily functions (like heart rate and muscle tension) which *may* have some effect on seizure control (evidence is limited, but worth exploring if you're interested).\n\n\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Questions:**\n\n*   **Chiropractic Treatment:**  The evidence for chiropractic treatment directly impacting *epilepsy* is extremely weak.  While chiropractic care can be helpful for musculoskeletal issues (neck pain, back pain), there isn't strong scientific support for it reducing seizures.  Some people report anecdotal benefits, but that doesn't mean it's a reliable treatment.  *Could it indirectly help if you have neck issues contributing to stress?* Possibly, but it\u2019s not a primary epilepsy treatment.\n*   **Acupuncture:**  Similar to chiropractic, the evidence for acupuncture as a direct epilepsy treatment is limited and inconsistent. Some studies show no benefit, while others suggest a potential small effect on seizure frequency for *some* individuals. Again,  anecdotal reports exist, but it\u2019s not a standard medical recommendation.\n\n**Regarding Cannabis Use:**\n\nThis is a complex topic. You said you're an everyday smoker.  \n\n* **Potential Interactions:** Cannabis can interact with ASMs, potentially altering their effectiveness. \n* **Seizure Threshold:**  There\u2019s conflicting evidence \u2013 some suggest cannabis can lower the seizure threshold (making seizures more likely), while others suggest CBD (a component of cannabis) can have anti-seizure effects. *This is where it gets tricky.* The effects depend on the strain, the dosage, and your individual brain chemistry.\n* **Transparency:** **Be completely honest with your neurologist about your cannabis use.** This is vital for them to assess potential interactions and make informed treatment decisions.  They may be able to offer specific guidance.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   \u201cWhat is the exact seizure focus that they\u2019re hoping to identify with the EMU?\u201d\n*   \u201cGiven my seizure type and potential focus, what are *all* my surgical options (including the pros and cons of each)?\u201d\n*   \u201cWould I be a candidate for RNS or DBS?\u201d\n*   \u201cCan you refer me to a registered dietitian specializing in ketogenic or modified Atkins diets?\u201d\n*   \u201cWhat are your thoughts on adding another ASM, and if so, which ones would you recommend?\u201d\n*   \"What is your opinion on my cannabis use, and how might it be impacting my epilepsy treatment?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* interesting and concerning set of experiences, and it's good you're actively seeking information and documenting it. The fact your nurse is unfamiliar doesn't mean it's not happening or isn't important, just that it's not a common reported side effect (which doesn\u2019t negate its significance).  Let's break down what's going on, potential explanations, and what you should do.  This is a complex situation and *requires* ongoing communication with your psychiatrist and ECT team. **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice; this is for informational purposes only.  You must discuss this with qualified medical professionals.**\n\n**Understanding the Baseline: ECT & Cognitive Effects**\n\n* **ECT & Memory/Cognition:**  ECT intentionally induces a brief seizure. This can, and often does, cause temporary cognitive disruption \u2013 confusion, disorientation, memory problems (especially retrograde amnesia \u2013 difficulty remembering things *before* ECT).  The degree of this varies greatly between individuals, electrode placement (unilateral vs. bilateral), stimulation parameters, and individual brain sensitivity.\n* **Headaches:**  Post-ECT headaches are very common. They're thought to be due to the induced seizure activity and changes in brain metabolism. Your experience is not unusual in that regard.\n* **Deja Vu/Recurrence Phenoma:** Deja vu, and related experiences like *jamais vu* (the feeling that something familiar is suddenly strange) can be triggered by temporal lobe activity.  The temporal lobes are highly involved in memory and recognition.  ECT, especially bilateral ECT, can affect temporal lobe functioning.\n\n**Your Specific Experiences \u2013 Decoding the Puzzle**\n\nWhat you describe goes beyond \u201ctypical\u201d ECT cognitive effects and is what makes this noteworthy:\n\n1. **Intense, Persistent Deja Vu (Initial Phase):**  The frequency and intensity of the deja vu experienced initially (2-10 times *per day* for 1.5 months) is high. The reduction to 3x/week is positive, but still suggests significant temporal lobe disruption.\n2. **Recognition Difficulty/False Familiarity:** This moves beyond just *feeling* like you've been somewhere before.  The difficulty placing recently met people, coupled with the \"knowing them all along\" sensation, is more akin to a *misattribution* of memory \u2013 your brain is incorrectly assigning familiarity to new individuals. This is what's most concerning.\n3. **The \"Everyone I Knew\" Phenomenon:** This is the most striking and unusual part.  The fact you consistently encountered people you *felt* you recognized, even in a location far from home, and *they didn't acknowledge you* is baffling. This suggests a distortion of recognition *specifically* of faces and perhaps a disruption in the social context of memory.  The lack of reciprocal recognition points to this being internal to your perception, rather than actual past encounters.\n\n**Potential Neurological and Psychological Explanations**\n\nThis is where it gets speculative, and a professional evaluation is critical. Here are some possibilities:\n\n* **Complex Temporal Lobe Dysfunction:** The initial high-frequency deja vu suggests significant disruption of temporal lobe function.  While it improved, the lingering misattribution of familiarity could represent a \"residual effect\" or a more subtle, persistent alteration in how your brain processes recognition.\n* **Familiarity-Based Recognition Error:**  This theory suggests that your brain is relying solely on the *feeling* of familiarity without correctly accessing associated memories to confirm a past connection.  ECT could be exacerbating this tendency.\n* **Capgras Delusion (Differential Diagnosis):** While your experience doesn't *perfectly* fit, it raises a flag for considering Capgras delusion.  Capgras is a rare delusion where a person believes that a familiar person (or even themselves) has been replaced by an impostor.  The core issue is a disconnection between emotional recognition and logical recognition.  *You are not experiencing a full-blown Capgras delusion, as you don't believe they are imposters, but the misattribution of familiarity overlaps.*\n* **Kindling (Less Likely, but Possible):**  Repeated ECT sessions (even with a break) can potentially, though rarely, lead to \u201ckindling\u201d \u2013  a lowering of the seizure threshold, potentially increasing the risk of abnormal brain activity. However, kindling usually presents with seizure-related symptoms, which you aren\u2019t describing.\n* **Psychological Component:**  Severe depression can, in itself, cause cognitive distortions and alterations in perception. While ECT is targeting the depression directly, the underlying vulnerability to perceptual differences may still be present.  It's possible the ECT is unveiling or altering these existing tendencies.\n* **Rare ECT-Induced Neurological Effect:** While ECT is generally considered safe, the brain is incredibly complex.  It\u2019s possible (though less likely) that the ECT is triggering a unique, idiosyncratic neurological response.\n\n\n\n**What You MUST Do**\n\n1. **Immediate Communication with Your Psychiatrist:**  This is the *most* important step.  Describe these experiences in detail. Don\u2019t minimize anything.  Especially emphasize the \"everyone I knew\" phenomenon and the lack of reciprocal recognition.  Your psychiatrist needs to re-evaluate your ECT protocol.\n2. **Neurological Consultation:**  Ask your psychiatrist for a referral to a neurologist for a full assessment.  An EEG (electroencephalogram) could be considered to assess brain activity.  Neuroimaging (MRI) might be helpful to rule out any structural abnormalities, especially if things don\u2019t improve.\n3. **Detailed Symptom Journal:** Continue to keep a very detailed journal.  Record:\n    * **Time of day:** When do these experiences occur?\n    * **Context:** Where are you? What are you doing? Are you tired, stressed, etc.?\n    * **Specifics:** Be as detailed as possible about the people you encounter.  What age, gender, approximate features? What was the setting?\n    * **Intensity:** Rate the strength of the feeling of recognition.\n    * **Headache Severity:** Track the timing and intensity of your headaches.\n4. **Medication Review (Even Though You Aren't Taking Any):** Ask your psychiatrist if there are potential interactions *between* ECT and any subtle underlying neurochemical imbalances. While you're not on medication now, understanding your brain's baseline is crucial.\n5.  **Consider a Modified ECT Protocol:** Your psychiatrist may consider:\n    * **Reducing Frequency:** Less frequent ECT sessions.\n    * **Changing Electrode Placement:** Switching from bilateral to unilateral ECT (unilateral ECT generally has fewer cognitive side effects).\n    * **Adjusting Stimulation Parameters:** Fine-tuning the electrical current and pulse width.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Don\u2019t Self-Diagnose:**  I've listed potential explanations, but it\u2019s vital to leave the diagnosis to qualified professionals.\n* **Be Your Own Advocate:** You know your experience best.  Don't be afraid to push for further investigation if you feel your concerns aren't being adequately addressed.\n* **Safety:**  If you experience any new or worsening symptoms (especially confusion, disorientation, or severe distress), seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a challenging situation, but by being proactive, communicating openly with your medical team, and diligently tracking your symptoms, you can work towards finding answers and a treatment plan that minimizes these distressing side effects.  I sincerely hope you get the support and answers you need.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Could it be something else?I refuse to take anti seizure meds without being confident and the lack of proof makes me weary of doctors who are quick to prescribe such strong meds.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and your caution about jumping onto strong medication is *very* reasonable. You're right to question a quick diagnosis, especially with a clean MRI and EKG.  Let's break down your symptoms and explore possibilities beyond a simple epilepsy diagnosis. I will preface this with a **very important disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**Analyzing Your Symptoms:**\n\nYour description points to a cluster of neurological symptoms that *could* be seizures, but also fit other conditions. Here\u2019s a detailed look:\n\n* **Prior History of Migraines:**  This is significant. Migraines can be complex and sometimes manifest with atypical symptoms. Childhood migraines can alter brain pathways.\n* **Previous Loss of Consciousness (Fainting):**  This initially pointed the neurologist towards epilepsy, and that's understandable.  However, fainting has many causes (vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias - though EKG was clear).\n* **\"Wave of Feeling Ill/Nausea\":** This is often described as an *aura* in migraine, but it can also precede seizures.\n* **Involuntary Grimacing (Lemon Face):** This is *very* interesting and less typical of a classic seizure. It suggests involvement of facial muscles in a specific, unusual way. This could point toward focal neurological activity, but not necessarily epileptic in nature.\n* **Slurred/Slow Speech (Dysarthria):** This is a key symptom.  Dysarthria indicates a problem with the *execution* of speech, not necessarily the thought process itself. This could relate to pathways controlling the muscles of speech.\n* **Forehead Swelling Sensation:** This is a subjective sensation, but if consistent, it suggests localized discomfort or pressure.  This is not commonly associated with generalized seizures.\n* **Itchy Scalp:** This could be unrelated and coincidental, or potentially related to nerve irritation.\n* **Post-Episode Exhaustion:**  Feeling \"hit by a truck\" afterwards is common with *both* seizures *and* migraines.  It also occurs with many other neurological events.\n\n**Could It Be Seizures?**\n\nYes, it *could*, but the presentation isn't textbook. Your symptoms suggest a *focal* seizure (starting in one part of the brain) rather than a generalized seizure (affecting the whole brain).  Focal seizures can have very diverse symptoms, depending on the brain area involved.  *However*, the lack of consistent seizure activity on EEG (if you've had one \u2013 and you should, see below) is concerning for a simple epilepsy diagnosis.\n\n**What Else Could It Be? (Differential Diagnosis)**\n\nHere's where it gets more complex.  Here are several possibilities to discuss with a doctor:\n\n* **Migraine Variants:**  Migraines can present in many, many ways.  Some migraine variants can cause focal neurological symptoms that resemble seizures. *Hemiplegic migraine* can even cause temporary weakness on one side of the body.  Your grimacing and speech difficulties could be part of a complex migraine aura.  Atypical migraine with brainstem aura could also be considered.\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) / Stroke:** While less likely given your age and clean MRI, brief interruptions of blood flow to the brain can cause temporary neurological deficits.  This is something a neurologist *must* rule out, especially with speech disturbance. (Though MRI is good for ruling this out.)\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  This is a condition where neurological symptoms are present without structural damage to the nervous system. It's often triggered by stress or psychological factors, but it's *not* \"made up.\"  FND can cause a wide range of symptoms, including dysarthria, weakness, and sensory disturbances. This is often a diagnosis of exclusion (meaning other things have been ruled out).\n* **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):**  While less likely with a normal MRI, MS can sometimes present with atypical symptoms, and early MS lesions might be subtle.\n* **Movement Disorder:** Some less common movement disorders could potentially cause these combinations of symptoms.\n* **Paroxysmal Dyskinesias:** These are rare disorders characterized by brief, involuntary movements.\n* **Vascular Malformation:** While MRI was clear, sometimes subtle vascular issues can be missed.\n* **Inner Ear Problems:**  Though less likely to cause all your symptoms, inner ear dysfunction can sometimes cause dizziness, nausea, and imbalance that could be misinterpreted.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do Now (and Advocate For):**\n\n1. **Demand a Video EEG:**  A standard EEG only records brain activity for a short period. A *video EEG* records brain activity *while also* video recording you.  This is crucial to capture what happens *during* an episode.  Wear it for as long as possible \u2013 multiple days if feasible \u2013 and specifically try to provoke an episode (safely, of course) if you can identify triggers.\n2. **Detailed Neurological Exam:**  A very thorough neurological exam, focusing on cranial nerve function, motor skills, sensory perception, and reflexes, is essential.\n3. **Review of Medications:**  List *all* medications and supplements you take.\n4. **Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Keep a meticulous diary of each episode, including:\n    * Time of day\n    * Triggering factors (stress, food, weather, etc.)\n    * Specific symptoms (in order)\n    * Duration of symptoms\n    * What helps alleviate symptoms\n    * How you feel afterwards\n5. **Second Opinion:**  Absolutely get a second opinion from another neurologist, preferably one specializing in epilepsy *or* migraine/headache disorders.\n6. **Consider Neuro-Ophthalmology Consultation:**  (if vision changes are present)\n7. **Discuss FND:**  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about Functional Neurological Disorder.  It requires specialized assessment and treatment.\n8. **Be a Partner in Your Care:** You are right to be cautious about medication. Keep expressing your concerns and advocating for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI Chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. Self-treating can be dangerous.  A proper diagnosis requires a full medical history, physical examination, and potentially further testing.  Do not delay seeking medical attention if you are experiencing concerning symptoms.\n\n\n\n**To help me refine this response and potentially offer more tailored suggestions, could you tell me:**\n\n* **Have you had a video EEG? If so, what were the results?**\n* **How often are these episodes happening?**\n* **Can you identify any consistent triggers?**\n* **Do you have any other symptoms that you haven't mentioned (e.g., vision changes, dizziness, weakness, numbness)?**\n* **What did the neurologist say specifically led them to the epilepsy diagnosis?**\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful.  Good luck, and please keep advocating for yourself until you get answers you\u2019re comfortable with."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly frightening, and you were very brave to share all of this. It\u2019s good you sought medical attention, but it\u2019s understandably unsettling that the initial tests came back seemingly normal.  Let's break down what could be going on, given the details you've provided. **Please read the *very important disclaimer* at the end of this response.**\n\n**Here\u2019s a comprehensive look at potential causes, categorized by likelihood, considering your history and symptoms.  I will also indicate where further investigation is *absolutely* crucial.**\n\n**1. Cardiovascular Issues (High Priority for Investigation):**\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) / \"Mini-Stroke\":** This is a *very serious* possibility, even with a normal EKG. A TIA occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is temporarily blocked. Your symptoms (numbness on one side, vision changes, altered sensation, loss of consciousness) align with this.  The fact that it resolved doesn't mean it was *not* a TIA.  TIAs are warning signs of a potential future stroke.  *Your age is lower than typical stroke patients, but substance use significantly increases risk.*\n*   **Vasospasm:**  Cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictor (it narrows blood vessels). This could have triggered a temporary spasm in a blood vessel in your brain or neck, leading to reduced blood flow and your symptoms.  This is more likely given your drug use.\n*   **Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure):** The doctor noted low blood pressure, which can reduce blood flow to the brain. While the reading may have normalized by the time of tests, it could have been severely low *during* the event.  However, low blood pressure alone typically doesn\u2019t explain the focal neurological symptoms (numbness on one side, specific eye sensation).\n* **Arrhythmia:** Although your EKG was normal, intermittent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can sometimes be missed on a single EKG. These could cause a sudden drop in blood pressure and fainting.\n\n**2. Neurological Issues (Require Further Evaluation):**\n\n*   **Seizure (Despite No Prior History):** While you haven't had seizures before, it's certainly possible to have a first-time seizure at your age.  Substance use, especially cocaine, is a known trigger for seizures.  Sometimes seizures don't present as classic convulsions; they can be subtle or focal (affecting only one part of the body).  The fact that your friend *thought* it looked like a seizure is significant.  *You need a neurological workup.*\n*   **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines are preceded by neurological symptoms called an aura (visual disturbances, numbness, tingling). But a migraine aura *usually* doesn't cause loss of consciousness *and* typically develops more gradually.  \n*   **Transient Global Amnesia:**  This is rare and involves a temporary loss of memory, but doesn't typically involve the physical symptoms (numbness, weakness) you experienced.\n\n**3. Substance-Related Causes (Highly Likely, Given Your Use):**\n\n*   **Cocaine Toxicity/Overdose:** Cocaine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including neurological effects, arrhythmias, and loss of consciousness.  The \"euphoric and safe\" feeling during the unconsciousness is concerning, as this can be a component of an overdose experience.\n*   **Interaction between Substances:** Combining cocaine with weed and vaping (nicotine) can have unpredictable effects on your cardiovascular and nervous systems.\n* **Withdrawal:** While less likely if you use regularly, sudden changes in use *could* contribute to physiological stress.\n\n**4. Other Considerations (Less Likely, but Possible):**\n\n*   **Dehydration:**  Can contribute to low blood pressure and dizziness, but less likely to cause the focal neurological symptoms.\n*   **Panic Attack:**  Can cause hyperventilation, dizziness, and some physical sensations, but usually doesn\u2019t cause true numbness or loss of consciousness that sounds like you experienced.\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Issues with the autonomic nervous system (which controls things like blood pressure and heart rate) can sometimes cause fainting, but is less likely to explain the entire constellation of symptoms.\n\n\n\n**Why the \"Normal\" Tests Aren't Reassuring:**\n\n*   **Timing is Crucial:**  Many of these conditions are *transient*.  Meaning the evidence of them (like an abnormal EKG or blood marker) may be gone by the time you get to the hospital.\n*   **Initial Tests May Not Be Enough:** A basic EKG and blood tests don't rule out  TIAs, vasospasm, or subtle seizure activity.\n* **Substance Use Masking:** Drug use can sometimes complicate test results or make it harder to pinpoint the cause.\n\n\n\n\n**What You *Absolutely* Need to Do Now:**\n\n1.  **Neurological Consultation:**  *This is the most important step.* You need to see a neurologist (a doctor specializing in the brain and nervous system) *immediately*.  They may order:\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** This is much more sensitive than a CT scan in detecting stroke, even small ones.\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To check for seizure activity.\n    *   **Extended Cardiac Monitoring:**  A Holter monitor or event recorder to look for intermittent arrhythmias.\n    * **Vascular Imaging:** Imaging of the blood vessels in your neck and brain to look for blockages or abnormalities.\n2.  **Be Honest with Doctors:** *You must* tell your doctors about your cocaine, weed, and vaping use.  I know it can be scary, but withholding information will hinder their ability to diagnose and treat you accurately.  They are there to help you, and confidentiality is legally protected.\n3. **Cardiology Follow-up:** Even with a normal EKG, a cardiology consult is reasonable given the possibility of vasospasm or intermittent arrhythmias.\n4.   **Stop Using Substances:**  I know this is difficult, but continuing to use cocaine, weed, and vaping will significantly increase your risk of another event and can make it harder to determine the underlying cause.  *This is critical for your health.*\n\n**The \"Feeling of Death\" and Passing Out:**  The sensation you described during unconsciousness is deeply concerning. It suggests a very significant disruption of brain activity.\n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "18M I think it might be a form of seizure or epilepsy... I will try to be conecentrating on something and then all of a sudden i lose concentration, and when i realize and try to focus again my whole body will twitch. The twitch lasts just a second. Let me inform you that this has led to a seizure only once before (for the last 10 years) and the doctors said it was from dehydration. But the twitching won't stop, any clue what it is? It doesn't cause any pain or fatigue afterwards, just a little stress that it could have been a serious seizure like before. I don't know its happening until afterwards, and it happens everytime i try to re-focus.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds concerning and it's good you're taking it seriously, especially given your past history. It's absolutely right to try and figure out what's going on.  Here's a breakdown of possibilities, what to do, and why I **strongly recommend seeing a doctor promptly**.  I'll follow this with a *very important disclaimer*.\n\n**Possible Explanations (Important: I am *not* diagnosing you. These are possibilities to discuss with a doctor):**\n\n* **Myoclonus:** This is a sudden, brief, involuntary muscle jerk or twitch. It's actually quite common and often benign.  However, *the fact it's consistently linked to refocusing* is important and needs investigation. There are different types of myoclonus.\n    * **Physiologic Myoclonus:** This can occur when someone is stressed, anxious, fatigued, or after exercise. Sometimes it can happen when abruptly stopping caffeine. Your description of it coinciding with refocusing could possibly fit into this category, but needs to be ruled out.\n    * **Essential Myoclonus:**  This is a neurological condition causing rhythmic twitching.\n    * **Epileptic Myoclonus:** This is a symptom of some types of epilepsy.  Your history of a prior seizure, even attributed to dehydration, increases the importance of ruling this out.\n* **Focal Seizure (with Somatic Component):** While you've only had one seizure 10 years ago, focal seizures can sometimes manifest as brief motor twitches *without* loss of consciousness or dramatic symptoms.  The fact it happens with increased mental effort raises this possibility. They can be subtle and easily missed if not properly observed.\n* **Hypnic Jerks:** These are the \"sleep starts\" you get when falling asleep.  However, these usually happen *when relaxing*, not when trying to focus. Seems less likely, but it's good to be comprehensive.\n* **Anxiety/Stress:** While not directly causing twitches, high anxiety can manifest in physical symptoms, and sometimes can exacerbate underlying neurological tendencies. The stress *following* the twitch is likely contributing to a cycle.\n* **Dehydration/Electrolyte Imbalance:** While your previous seizure was attributed to dehydration, *chronic* mild dehydration or imbalances in electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) can sometimes contribute to muscle irritability.  However, this is less likely to be consistently triggered by focusing.\n* **Medication Side Effect:**  Are you taking any medications (prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements)?  Some medications can cause muscle twitches as a side effect.\n* **Caffeine/Stimulant Use:**  Excessive caffeine or other stimulants can certainly contribute to twitching.\n\n**Why the Link to Refocusing is Important:**\n\nThe fact that the twitch *consistently* happens when you try to refocus is a key piece of information. This suggests that the issue is linked to neurological activity related to concentration and cognitive effort. This strengthens the possibility of a subtle seizure focus or a specific type of myoclonus triggered by brain activity.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do (and in this order):**\n\n1. **See a Doctor \u2013 *Immediately*:**  **Do not delay.**  This warrants a medical evaluation.  A general practitioner (GP) is a good starting point, but ideally you'll be referred to a neurologist.  Tell them *everything*\u2014your history, the timing of the twitches, how they feel, what triggers them, and your anxiety about it.  Be very clear about the link to refocusing.\n2. **Keep a Detailed Log:**  Start *today* keeping a log of when the twitches happen. Include:\n    * **Time of day**\n    * **What you were doing *immediately* before (be specific - e.g., reading a textbook, solving a math problem, trying to remember a name)**\n    * **What you were thinking about**\n    * **How long the twitch lasted**\n    * **How intense the twitch was (a scale of 1-10)**\n    * **Any other symptoms you noticed (even subtle ones - a feeling of dizziness, a brief change in vision, a strange sensation)**\n    * **Your hydration level (how much water have you had)**\n    * **Caffeine/Stimulant intake**\n    * **Stress Level (1-10)**\n3. **Hydrate Properly:**  Drink plenty of water throughout the day.  Aim for at least 8 glasses.\n4. **Electrolyte Check:** Ask your doctor about getting your electrolyte levels checked with a blood test.\n5. **Review Medications/Supplements:**  Make a list of everything you take and discuss it with your doctor.\n6. **Consider Reducing Stimulants:** Temporarily reduce your caffeine intake to see if it makes a difference.\n\n\n\n**What the Doctor May Do:**\n\n* **Neurological Exam:**  A thorough examination to assess your reflexes, coordination, and nerve function.\n* **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This is the most important test. It records the electrical activity of your brain and can detect seizures or abnormal brain activity. *Even if your previous EEG was normal, you need another one now, given the new information about the link to focusing.*\n* **MRI of the Brain:**  May be ordered to look for any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n* **Blood Tests:** To check electrolyte levels, rule out other medical conditions, and assess for medication side effects.\n* **Video EEG:**  In some cases, they may want you to wear an EEG monitor while they observe you performing tasks that trigger the twitching. This is the most helpful in diagnosing subtle seizures.\n\n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. Self-treating can be dangerous.  The fact that you're experiencing these twitches, especially given your past seizure, requires a professional medical evaluation.  Don't try to diagnose yourself based on internet searches.  **Please see a doctor as soon as possible.**\n\n\n\n**To help me understand a little better (but *still see a doctor*):**\n\n* Could you describe the twitch in more detail? Is it a single muscle, a group of muscles, or your whole body?\n* Is it a sudden jerk, a sustained tremor, or something else?\n*  What does \"losing concentration\" feel like *before* the twitch?  Is it just that your mind wanders, or do you feel a different sensation?\n* How many times a day would you estimate this happens?\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and I sincerely hope you get answers and relief soon.  Take care and prioritize your health."

        "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\nOkay, this is a *very* detailed and helpful description. You are right to question whether this is \"just\" anxiety-fueled sleepwalking. While anxiety can absolutely contribute to parasomnias (sleep disturbances like sleepwalking, night terrors, etc.), the specifics of these episodes are unusual and warrant further investigation. Here\u2019s a breakdown of why, what flags are raised, what you should do, and what possibilities to discuss with a doctor.\n\n**Why This Is Concerning (Flags Raised):**\n\n* **Stereotypical Phasing:** The distinct phases you describe are not typical of simple sleepwalking. Most sleepwalking episodes are more disorganized. The progression from screaming, to rocking/self-harming movements, to purposeful (but odd) searching, then the *highly specific* request, and finally the relief/twitching is quite structured.\n* **The \"Urgent Task\" Component:**  This is the biggest red flag.  The need to complete a very particular action (blue marker/pyramid blanket) with the associated distress and relief is *very* unusual for standard sleepwalking. It suggests something more targeted is happening during these episodes.\n* **Complex Speech & Awareness within the Episode:** People in standard sleepwalking are often confused, disoriented, and have limited, garbled speech.  Your daughter has periods of awareness of *you* and even meaningful (though sometimes disrupted) attempts to communicate.  The spoken requests are clear and coherent.\n* **Sensory Component (\u201cWeird Feeling\u201d & Visual Distortions):**  The sensation in her forehead followed by visual distortions (doorframe too small, clone) sounds like a possible *sensory aura* or a complex hallucination. This doesn't align with typical sleepwalking.\n* **Sudden Onset & Timing (Post-UTI/Travel):** While not definitive, the sudden onset shortly after travel and the UTI/antibiotic course *could* point to triggering factors.  Travel disrupts routines and can increase stress.\n\n**Possible Considerations (Discuss with a Doctor \u2013 See Section Below):**\n\n* **Complex Partial Seizures (Nocturnal Epilepsy):**  This is the most concerning possibility, and the one that needs to be ruled out.  Complex partial seizures can occur during sleep, and can manifest in a *remarkably* similar way to what you\u2019re describing \u2013 automatisms (repetitive movements like rocking, lip smacking, hand movements), altered awareness, a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or something \"being off,\" and then a period of confusion/postictal state (the twitching and sudden sleep).  The fact that she remembers the events adds to the complexity, making it less typical of a classic sleepwalking event. They can include very specific \u2018compulsions\u2019 something must be done.\n* **Parasomnia with Dissociation:** A more complex parasomnia where dissociation is a key component. This is less likely given the specifics of the behavior.\n* **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** These are hallucinations that occur *falling* asleep (hypnagogic) or *waking* up (hypnopompic). However, these usually happen right at sleep onset/offset and don't typically have the complex behavioral components you're describing.\n* **Post-Infectious Encephalopathy or Encephalitis:** Although she didn\u2019t seem unwell during the trip, a UTI, even if treated, *could* rarely trigger a mild inflammatory response in the brain. This is less likely, but something a doctor would consider in the context of new neurological symptoms. (While she doesn\u2019t have other neurological symptoms, these episodes *are* a neurological event.)\n* **ADHD & Sleep:** While not directly causing this, unmanaged ADHD can certainly contribute to sleep difficulties. This could be exacerbating an underlying tendency toward parasomnias.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do - Immediately:**\n\n1. **Schedule an Appointment with Her Pediatrician:**  **Do this ASAP.**  Explain *everything* you've described, in detail.  Don't minimize any part of it.  Emphasize the structured phases, the specific requests, the sensory experiences, and the recent onset. \n    * **Ask for a referral to a pediatric neurologist.** *This is critical.* Her pediatrician may want to start with some basic tests, but a neurologist is the expert to rule out (or diagnose) seizure disorders.\n2. **Video Record (If Safe and Possible):**  If you can *safely* video record one of these episodes without interfering, it would be incredibly helpful for the neurologist.  Prioritize her safety over getting a recording, of course.  Do *not* try to stop her movements if it could cause her harm.\n3. **Keep a Detailed Sleep Diary:**  Continue to meticulously record:\n    * Time of the episode\n    * Duration of each phase\n    * EXACT details of what she says/does in each phase\n    * Any potential triggers (stress, late bedtime, changes in routine)\n    * What was happening *before* the trip - any unusual stressors or health events even a little before the trip?\n4. **Medication Review:** Provide the pediatrician with a complete list of all medications she's taken in the last 6 months, including the cefixime for the UTI.\n\n**What to Tell the Neurologist:**\n\n* Be prepared to answer questions about her family medical history, particularly any history of seizures, migraines, or neurological conditions.\n* Discuss her ADHD diagnosis and treatment (therapy only at present).\n* Emphasize her normal daytime functioning, but also mention the fatigue.\n* Bring your detailed sleep diary and any video recordings.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "26F I'm currently talking 30mg citalopram for depression and anxiety, it definitely helps with anxiety but my depression is just getting worse. At first I thought it was due to my other health issues but I think it's from increasing dose of citalopram?? Can SSRIs make you more depressed? I've been taking it for around 4-6 months.I've been trying to get a GP appointment for a week but they're always booked up (I'm in the UK) so I'm tempted to just stop taking it until I can get one and change meds but not sure if this is safe? Maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidalAlso I'm not sure what antidepressants to try next, I'm currently taking topirimate 50mg bidaily (hoping to increase this or might be swapping to another epilepsy med for my myoclonic jerks) so any med that has twitching as a possible side effect is a no. Also want to avoid anything that will make me tired, I have fatigue.I've tried Sertraline and fluoxetine in the past, I tried mirtazapine. Would amitripyline be a bad combo with topirimate cause I know they're both used for migraines too?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a lot to unpack, and it's good you're reaching out. It sounds like you're in a really difficult spot, and feeling increasingly desperate to find something that helps.  Let's break down your concerns, and I'll give you as much information as possible, *but please remember I am an AI and this is not medical advice.  You absolutely need to discuss this with a doctor.*\n\n**1. Can SSRIs (like Citalopram) Make Depression Worse?**\n\nYes, absolutely. It's not common, but it *can* happen. Here's why:\n\n*   **Emotional Blunting:**  SSRIs can sometimes reduce the intensity of *all* emotions, both positive and negative.  While this can be helpful for anxiety, it can lead to a feeling of emptiness or apathy that some people experience as worsening depression. It can feel like you're 'numb' and not fully experiencing life, which can be very demoralizing.\n*   **Activation/Anxiety First:**  Sometimes, initially, an SSRI can *increase* anxiety slightly, and if that anxiety isn't properly managed, it can worsen depressive symptoms.  While you said Citalopram helped your anxiety, it's possible that a subtle underlying anxiety is still contributing and interacting with the medication's effects.\n*   **Incorrect Diagnosis/Co-occurring Conditions:** Sometimes, what seems like worsening depression is actually an underlying condition like Bipolar Disorder manifesting, or a different anxiety disorder that needs specific treatment. (Less likely given your history, but needs to be considered).\n*   **Individual Response:** Everyone responds to medication differently.  What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another.  Your brain chemistry is unique.\n*   **Tolerance:** Over time, the initial benefit of an SSRI can decrease for some individuals.\n\nThe fact that your depression is worsening *after* an initial period of stability/benefit on Citalopram *strongly suggests* it's not working optimally for you *right now*.\n\n**2. Stopping Citalopram \u2013 Is It Safe?**\n\n**No, absolutely do not abruptly stop Citalopram.**  This can lead to *discontinuation syndrome*, which is a really unpleasant experience. Symptoms can include:\n\n*   Flu-like symptoms\n*   Insomnia\n*   Nausea\n*   Dizziness\n*   Sensory disturbances (brain zaps)\n*   Anxiety *worsening*\n*   Increased risk of relapse of depression or anxiety\n\nYou rightly identified that stopping abruptly could be dangerous, especially given your current feelings. **You need a doctor to supervise any reduction in dosage.** Even a slow taper can sometimes be challenging, but it's the safest approach.\n\nYour statement about \"maybe more safe than slowly becoming suicidal\" is a *very serious* sign.  This underscores how urgent it is to get medical help, even if it's frustratingly difficult to get an appointment.  (See section 5 about what to do if you can't get an appointment).\n\n**3.  Antidepressant Options, Considering Topiramate & Fatigue**\n\nOkay, you've already tried a few.  Here's a breakdown, considering your limitations (twitching/Topiramate, fatigue):\n\n*   **Sertraline & Fluoxetine (Tried previously):** These didn't work for you before, so it's unlikely to be a good first step to retry them.\n*   **Mirtazapine (Tried previously):**  You didn't mention *why* you stopped Mirtazapine, but it's known for causing sedation and weight gain, which would exacerbate your fatigue.\n*   **Amitriptyline:**  You're right to be cautious.  While effective, it has anticholinergic side effects, which can sometimes worsen myoclonic jerks (similar mechanism to Topiramate). It's also sedating and can contribute to fatigue.  The migraine overlap is a real consideration, but the interaction with Topiramate and the fatigue make it a risky choice.\n*   **SNRI (Venlafaxine, Duloxetine):** These work on both serotonin and norepinephrine. They *can* be activating, which *could* help with fatigue, but they also have potential side effects, including increased anxiety and, occasionally, twitching.  Duloxetine is sometimes used for nerve pain and could potentially be helpful if your myoclonic jerks have a neuropathic component.\n*   **Bupropion (Wellbutrin):**  This is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).  It's often less sedating than SSRIs/SNRIs and can be helpful for fatigue and motivation.  It is generally considered to have a lower risk of causing twitching, but it's not zero.\n*   **Nortriptyline:** A tricyclic antidepressant similar to Amitriptyline, but often with a slightly more favorable side effect profile (less anticholinergic). *Still* needs careful consideration with Topiramate.\n*   **Agomelatine:**  This is a newer antidepressant that works on melatonin receptors. It's generally well-tolerated and less likely to cause sexual side effects, which can sometimes contribute to depression.  It is not known to cause twitching.\n\n**Given your history and concerns, Bupropion or Duloxetine might be reasonable next steps, but *only* under a doctor's guidance.**  They need to weigh the pros and cons, considering your Topiramate use and fatigue.\n\n**4.  Topiramate & Antidepressant Interactions**\n\nYou're right to be thinking about this. Both Topiramate and some antidepressants (especially tricyclics like Amitriptyline) can affect the same neuronal pathways. This *could* increase the risk of side effects like twitching, cognitive impairment, or even seizures (rare, but possible).  It also complicates the metabolism of some drugs.  Your doctor needs to be incredibly careful about drug interactions.\n\n\n\n**5.  UK GP Access & What To Do Now**\n\nYou're right\u2014getting a GP appointment is incredibly difficult. Here are some options:\n\n*   **Keep Calling:** First thing in the morning, repeatedly. Appointments open up due to cancellations.\n*   **Online Consultation:**  Some GP practices offer online consultations.  It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.\n*   **111:** Call 111 (the NHS non-emergency number). Explain you are already under a doctor for mental health issues, your depression is worsening, and you need urgent advice regarding your medication.  They can often triage you and may be able to get you seen, or advise you to go to A&E if necessary.\n*   **A&E (Accident & Emergency):**  If you are feeling actively suicidal, *go to A&E immediately*. This is a crisis situation.  Do not hesitate.\n*   **Mental Health Crisis Line:** In the UK, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123 at any time.  They can provide emotional support and help you navigate your options.  (https://www.samaritans.org/)\n* **Private Psychiatry:** This is an expensive option, but could get you an appointment more quickly.\n\n\n\n**Important Recap/Action Steps:**\n\n1.  **Do NOT stop your Citalopram abruptly.**\n2.  **Prioritize getting a medical appointment.**  Use all the resources listed above.\n3.  **If you are having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, seek help *immediately* (A&E, 111, Samaritans).**\n4.  **When you see a doctor, be *very* specific about:**\n    * Your worsening depression despite being on Citalopram\n    * Your previous antidepressant trials and why they didn't work\n    * Your Topiramate use and concerns about interactions.\n    * Your fatigue and need to avoid sedating medications.\n    * Mention the twitching concern and desire to avoid medications that could worsen it.\n\nI truly hope you can get the help you need quickly.  You are proactive in seeking solutions, and that's a good sign.  Hang in there, and remember, you're not alone.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot, and it's *completely* understandable why you're feeling this way. You've been through a huge trauma, and you are understandably hypervigilant about protecting your son. You are a clearly devoted and insightful mother. Let's break down your concerns and try to offer some practical and reassuring thoughts.  I will preface this by saying I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is information to discuss with your son's neurologist.\n\n**First, Acknowledging Your Feelings:**\n\nYou've articulated your fears very well, and they are *valid*.  It's incredibly difficult to live with the knowledge your child has a neurological condition like cerebral palsy and epilepsy, especially after witnessing a scary, generalized seizure. The fear of \"what if\" is powerful, and the fact that you're worried about your impact on his future relationship with you speaks volumes about your care and awareness.  The COVID situation has understandably amplified your protective instincts, but it's also contributing to the isolation and anxiety.  You are *not* ruining his life, but your anxiety *is* potentially limiting his experiences, and it's significantly impacting *your* quality of life.  Addressing *your* well-being is also crucial for your son.\n\n\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Questions (and things to discuss with his neurologist):**\n\n*   **Likelihood of Another Generalized Seizure:** This is the hardest question. There\u2019s no way to predict the future. \n    *   **Stroke-Related Epilepsy:** Seizures after a stroke (like his perinatal stroke) are common. The initial insult to the brain creates areas prone to abnormal electrical activity.  The good news is that *many* cases of stroke-related epilepsy are well-controlled with medication.\n    *   **Keppra Effectiveness:** Keppra (levetiracetam) is a common first-line medication that is often effective.  The fact that it's currently controlling his seizures is fantastic! \n    *   **Risk is Not Zero:**  However, even with medication, there's *always* a risk of breakthrough seizures. The key is understanding *what* factors might increase that risk. These can include:\n        *   **Illness/Fever:** You are right to be cautious about fever.  Fever can lower the seizure threshold.\n        *   **Sleep Deprivation:**  Both for him and for you!\n        *   **Stress:**  (While challenging to quantify, significant stress can be a factor.)\n        *   **Medication Compliance:** Consistent Keppra dosing is critical.\n        *   **Developing Brain:** His brain is still developing, which can sometimes mean seizure patterns can change over time.\n    *   **Discuss with Neuro:**  The *exact* likelihood of a breakthrough seizure is something you need to discuss with his neurologist. They can assess his EEG results, MRI scans, and seizure history to give you a more personalized risk assessment.\n\n*   **Will Keppra Always Work?** Again, not something that can be guaranteed.\n    *   **Long-term Control:**  Many children remain on the same medication for years and maintain good control. \n    *   **Medication Changes:** It's also possible that over time, the medication might become less effective, or he might develop side effects.  That's why regular follow-ups with the neurologist are critical.  They may need to adjust the dose or consider other medications. \n    *   **Potential for Weaning (Future):** Down the road (years from now), if he remains seizure-free for a significant period, his neurologist might discuss the possibility of slowly weaning him off medication. *This is not something to consider now,* but it's a potential long-term goal.\n\n*   **How to Get Past This Fear and Let Him Be a Kid:** This is the core of your issue, and it's the most challenging. Here's a multi-pronged approach:\n    *   **Therapy for *You*:**Seriously.  This is huge. Your anxiety is impacting both of your lives.  A therapist specializing in anxiety and/or parental anxiety related to chronic illness can provide coping strategies, help you process the trauma of the seizure, and challenge your thought patterns. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often helpful. \n    *   **Exposure Therapy (with guidance):** This, *done with a therapist,* involves gradually exposing yourself to situations that trigger your anxiety, starting with less threatening ones. The goal is to learn that you can tolerate the anxiety and that the feared outcome doesn't always happen.  (e.g. starting with a very short walk on a slightly busier trail, then gradually increasing duration and busyness).\n    *   **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** This helps you accept the uncertainty of life and focus on living a meaningful life *despite* the fear.\n    *   **Re-evaluate Risk vs. Benefit:** Discuss specific activities with his neurologist and a therapist.  What is the *actual* risk involved in hiking a trail?  What protective measures can you take to minimize that risk?  Is the benefit of the experience (fresh air, exercise, enjoyment) worth the calculated risk?\n    *   **Gradual Re-integration:** Don't try to go from completely isolated to full-on activities overnight. Start small.  Maybe a quiet visit to a park with few people.  Then a gradual increase in social interaction.\n    *   **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't control whether he has a seizure, but you *can* control that he's taking his medication, that you're prepared with rescue meds, and that you're educated about his condition.\n    *   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Practices like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help manage your anxiety in the moment.\n    *    **Support Groups:** Connecting with other parents of children with epilepsy or CP can be incredibly validating and helpful.\n\n\n\n\n**Regarding Your Cameras & Hypervigilance:**\n\nThe cameras are understandable, but they likely *increase* your anxiety.  They reinforce the idea that you *need* to constantly monitor him, preventing you from relaxing. As you work with a therapist, you can discuss strategies for gradually reducing your reliance on them.\n\n\n\n**Important Points to Discuss with His Neurologist:**\n\n*    **Seizure Action Plan:** Ensure you have a clear, written seizure action plan.\n*   **Rescue Medication Clarity:** Confirm you are comfortable administering the rescue medication. Make sure you have enough available.\n*   **EEG Monitoring:** Discuss the frequency of EEG monitoring to assess seizure control.\n*   **MRI schedule:** Discuss the schedule for follow up MRIs to evaluate for changes in the brain.\n*   **Triggers:**  Specifically ask about potential triggers for *his* seizures.\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou are an incredible mother.  Your love and concern for your son are evident.  You deserve to live a life that's not consumed by fear.  Taking care of yourself is *not* selfish; it's essential.  It\u2019s not about eliminating fear entirely, but learning to manage it so it doesn't control your life or your son's. It\u2019s about finding a balance between being a protective parent and allowing him to experience the joy and freedom of childhood.  \n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n*   **Cerebral Palsy Foundation:** [https://yourcpf.org/](https://yourcpf.org/)\n*   **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/) (for mental health support)\n\n\n\n\n**Please use this as a starting point for a conversation with your son's medical team. They can provide the most accurate and personalized information and guidance.**\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope this helps. You and your sons are in my thoughts."

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

You've already done a *remarkable* amount of self-investigation and troubleshooting.  Let's break down potential avenues to explore with your doctor, building on your observations and addressing the concerns you've rightly identified.  I will provide this as detailed information, but **please remember I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnosis or treatment. This is for informational purposes to help you advocate for yourself.**\n\n\n\n**1. The TMJ/Vascular Connection: You\u2019re onto something important.**\n\nYou are absolutely right to focus on what you've discovered with the TMJ manipulation.  That consistent (even temporary) relief is a *huge* clue, and a smart observation about the localized blood flow change. Here\u2019s why this is plausible and what to discuss:\n\n*   **Temporal Artery and Branches:** The temporalis muscle (involved in chewing) is located right next to the temporal artery, a major artery supplying blood to the brain. Branches of this artery wrap around the TMJ.  Compression or restriction in this area *can* affect blood flow.\n*   **Internal Carotid Artery Proximity:**  While the main internal carotid artery is deeper, its branches are in the region, and even subtle shifts or pressure around the TMJ could influence flow dynamics.\n*   **Vascular Compression Syndrome:** This isn\u2019t a single diagnosis, but a concept where structures (like muscles, ligaments, or even bone) compress nerves or blood vessels. You could have a form of this affecting vessels near the TMJ.\n* **Sphenopalatine Ganglion:** This is a cluster of nerves near where you describe feeling the blood flow.  It's involved in vascular control and can cause facial pain and altered sensations. Manipulation could potentially influence it.\n\n**What to tell your doctor:**  Specifically describe the warm/liquid sensation exactly as you experience it.  \"When I manipulate the TMJ in this specific way, I feel a definite increase in blood flow in my cheek, and a warm sensation.  This is accompanied by a transient improvement in my 'blanking out' and focus.\" Emphasize *consistency* of the relief, even if temporary.  Tell her this is the *only* thing that has consistently improved your symptoms.\n\n\n\n**2.  Re-Examining the Vascular Studies (MRI/MRA)**\n\nNormal results don\u2019t rule everything out. Here's why and what to ask:\n\n*   **Dynamic vs. Static Imaging:**  MRIs and MRAs are often 'snapshots' in time. They show anatomy, but less well dynamic *flow* issues. Your problem sounds like it's flow-related, not necessarily structural.\n*   **Subtle Stenosis/Compression:** Subtle narrowing or compression of vessels, *especially* if intermittent (happens sometimes, not all the time), might be missed on standard imaging.\n*   **Venous Issues:** MRAs primarily focus on arteries. A venous sinus issue (problems with drainage of blood *from* the brain) could also contribute to these sensations.\n*   **Repeat Imaging with Specific Protocol:**  Ask if a repeat MRA could be done *with a specific protocol* focusing on flow dynamics and potentially including a provocative maneuver (like having you open and close your jaw during the scan). A  \"MR Angiography with Jaw Movement\" is what you would want to ask about.\n\n**What to tell your doctor:**  \"I understand the prior MRIs were normal, but my symptoms are very real and consistent. Could we discuss whether a more specialized MRA, focusing on flow with jaw movement, might be helpful to rule out subtle vascular abnormalities?\"  \n\n\n\n**3.  Neurological Considerations \u2013 Beyond ADD**\n\nYour symptoms have a neurological component \u2013 the altered perception, the feeling of \"fragmentation.\"  While ADD/ADHD were considered, there's more to explore:\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) \u2013 \"Mini-strokes\":** While less likely at your age, intermittent reduced blood flow *can* cause temporary neurological symptoms.\n*   **Migraine Variants:**  Some migraine subtypes can present with atypical symptoms \u2013 auras that aren't visual, or feelings of unreality.\n*   **Sensory Integration Issues:** Your brain may be struggling to process all incoming stimuli correctly, leading to the \"less grounded\" feeling.  This could be exacerbated by the vascular component, or a separate issue.\n*   **Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction:** This system controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and sometimes perception. Dysfunction could explain the fluctuating sensations.\n\n**What to tell your doctor:**  \"I'm concerned about the neurological aspects of this. I feel like my brain isn't consistently 'online.' I'd like to explore the possibility of neurological causes beyond ADD, such as migraines or potential vascular contributions to neurological dysfunction.\"\n\n\n\n**4.  Further Specialists to Consider:**\n\n*   **Vascular Neurologist:** This is *crucial*. These specialists focus on blood vessels in the brain and nervous system.  They're best equipped to analyze your imaging and consider flow-related issues.\n*   **Neuro-Ophthalmologist:**  If your eye movements *are* affected (even subtly), a neuro-ophthalmologist can evaluate the nerves controlling eye movement and look for signs of neurological problems.\n*   **Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon (with TMJ Expertise):**  A surgeon specializing in the jaw can assess the TMJ structure and function, and rule out anatomical issues.\n\n\n\n**5.  Important to Communicate \u2013 Your Mental Wellbeing**\n\nYou're bravely acknowledging the emotional toll.  *Do not downplay this*.  \n\n*   **Suicidal Ideation:**  If you're having suicidal thoughts, please reach out for help *immediately*.  (See resources at the end.) Your doctor needs to know this; it doesn't invalidate your physical symptoms, it highlights the severity of your suffering.\n*   **The Impact on Your Life:**  Be specific about how this affects your daily functioning, academics, social life, and motivation.  \n\n**What to tell your Doctor**: \"This condition has drastically affected my quality of life. I'm feeling increasingly hopeless and it's impacting my mental health. I need help finding a diagnosis and effective treatment.\"\n\n\n\n**Important Points to Bring to Your Appointment:**\n\n*   **A detailed symptom journal:** Record *exactly* when the \u201cblanking out\u201d occurs, what you're doing, and the duration. Note the timing related to activities like chewing, talking, or head position.\n*   **A visual map of where you feel the relief with the TMJ manipulation.**\n*   **A list of all the treatments you\u2019ve tried, and the results (or lack thereof).**\n* **Bring a friend or family member** to the appointment for support and to help you articulate your concerns.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada, or dial 111 in the UK.\n*   **The TMJ Association:**  [https://www.tmj.org/](https://www.tmj.org/)\n*   **American Headache Society:** [https://americanheadachesociety.org/](https://americanheadachesociety.org/)\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou are a very astute and proactive patient. Your detailed observations are invaluable. It's frustrating that it's taken so long to get answers, but don't give up advocating for yourself. The connection you\u2019ve made between the TMJ and your symptoms is a crucial lead, and a good doctor will take it seriously.  \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good set of questions, and it\u2019s smart to be digging deeper than a quick Google search. You're right to be curious about the nuanced experience of seizures, particularly with a history like yours. Let's break down each question, and then I'll provide some helpful resources.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**\n\n**1. Can you feel a seizure *in* your head?**\n\nYes, absolutely. While many people associate seizures with dramatic convulsions affecting the whole body, that's not always the case.  Seizures originate from abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  That activity *can* be felt internally, within the head, even *before* it spreads (if it does) to other areas. Experiences can vary widely, but here are some ways someone might feel it \"in their head\":\n\n*   **Sensations**:  A strange buzzing, tingling, or a localized pressure in the head.  Some describe it as an electrical feeling.\n*   **Thoughts/Emotions**:  A sudden, inexplicable feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, intense fear, anxiety, or a feeling of being detached from reality. These can feel very internal and \"in the head.\"\n*   **Visual disturbances:** Flashing lights, spots, or distorted vision can be experienced even *without* outward motor signs.\n*   **Auditory disturbances**: Hearing noises or voices that aren't there.\n*   **Alteration in Thinking**: A momentary confusion, difficulty finding words, or a blanking out sensation.  This can be internal and not outwardly obvious.\n*   **Head Jerks/Movements**: Occasionally, very subtle head movements occur that are not full-blown convulsions but can be felt internally.\n\nThese primarily \"internal\" experiences are often called **focal aware seizures** (previously known as simple partial seizures). The person remains aware of what\u2019s happening and can usually describe the sensation.  The feeling of something happening *inside* the head is common with these.\n\n**2. Google says it goes from your head to other parts of the body, but is that always true?**\n\nGoogle is partially correct. Seizures *can* spread.  A **focal aware seizure** (starting in one area and staying localized) *can* evolve into a **focal impaired awareness seizure** (where awareness is affected), and then potentially a **focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure** (the generalized convulsion many people picture).  However, not all seizures spread.  Many remain focal and do not involve widespread motor symptoms.\n\n**3. Why don\u2019t all seizures show up on an EEG?**\n\nEEGs (electroencephalograms) measure electrical activity in the brain. They are valuable but not perfect. Here's why:\n\n*   **Timing:** EEGs record brain activity over a *period of time* (usually 20-30 minutes, sometimes longer with overnight monitoring). A seizure might happen *between* recordings.  Seizures can be infrequent.\n*   **Location:** If the seizure activity is deep within the brain, the electrodes on the scalp might not detect it effectively. It's like trying to hear a whisper in a crowded room.\n*   **Seizure type**:  Some seizure types, especially more subtle focal seizures, produce less dramatic electrical changes that are harder to capture.\n*   **Normal Background Activity**: The normal electrical activity of the brain can sometimes mask seizure activity.\n* **Interictal vs. Ictal:** An EEG during a seizure (ictal) is much more likely to show abnormal activity than one taken between seizures (interictal). Often doctors look for *patterns* that suggest a propensity for seizures, even if they don't catch one happening.\n\n**4. Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one?**\n\nYes, this is very possible, and ties into the idea of focal impaired awareness seizures. There are a few scenarios:\n\n*   **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures**:  During these, awareness is altered, but the person isn't completely unconscious. They may perform automatic behaviors (lip smacking, picking at clothes, wandering).  They may not *remember* the seizure, but afterward, experience a period of confusion, fatigue, or a strange feeling \u2013 a sense that something was \u201coff\u201d or that they lost time.  This is what you mean by \"feeling like you had one.\"\n*   **Subclinical Seizures**: In some cases, particularly after surgery, the brain can reorganize.  Seizures may occur without any outward signs visible to others (or even consciously felt). These are harder to diagnose.  The aftermath, however, can leave someone feeling vaguely unwell or confused.\n* **Post-Ictal State**: This is the period *after* a seizure. Even if the seizure itself wasn't fully noticed, the post-ictal state can involve confusion, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, or a general feeling of being \u201cout of it.\u201d It can last from minutes to hours.\n\n**Resources for Further Reading:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) \u2013 This is *the* go-to resource.  They have detailed descriptions of seizure types, diagnosis, treatment, and support.  Specifically, look at their sections on \"Seizure Types\" and \"Living with Seizures.\"\n    *   https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/focal-seizures\n*   **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS):** [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/epilepsy](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/epilepsy) \u2013 A more scientifically focused resource.\n*   **Mayo Clinic:** [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350098](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350098) \u2013 Provides clear, patient-friendly information.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional (your neurologist) for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  \n\n\n\n**Specifically, given your history of seizures and surgery, it's crucial to discuss these feelings with your neurologist.**  They can review your EEG results, medical history, and current symptoms to determine if further investigation is needed. They may recommend further monitoring, adjustments to medication (if you're on any), or other appropriate steps.

        "question": "Hey all, I am a 30 yo white male. I am currently 270 pounds and 5'9. Active and fairly healthy. Meds: Keppra (1000mg x2 daily, Prozac 40mg 1x Daily, Clonazepam .5mg x2 daily, Meloxicam 15mg 1x daily, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin C Supplements) I had mono when i was 17 that developed into GBS. I had weakness, druken gate, and slurred speech and my main symptoms. Symptoms resolved in approx. 6 months and i was going back to normal. Shortly there after i started with seizures, one in November 2009, again in February 2010. I have been on Keppra since and been seizure free. I also have auto immune disease. One diagnosed, Hidradenitis Supperativa (doing well), and one undiagnosed. The undiagnosed one is more recently been bothering me.. i have Episcleritis and joint pain.. High ESR and CRP in the blood. I am worried about covid and want the vax but am afraid because i had a neurological reaction to the flu shot after my GBS. My Neurologist is insisting i get the vax and im talking to my Rheumi tomorrow. Is there anybody who can give me insight on what i should consider? Thank you!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex case, and you're right to be cautious and asking questions.  You have a lot going on, and it's smart to be thinking through the risks and benefits of the COVID vaccine.  Here's a breakdown of things to consider, pulling from medical knowledge and general recommendations, aimed at helping you have a productive conversation with your Rheumi tomorrow.  I will *not* be giving medical advice, as I am an AI and cannot do that. This is for informational purposes only.\n\n**First, Let's Summarize Your Key Factors:**\n\n* **Age & BMI:** 30, 5'9\", 270lbs.  This puts you in the overweight/obese category. Obesity *increases* risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of other issues.\n* **Neurological History:** GBS triggered by Mono, subsequent seizures controlled by Keppra.  This is a *major* consideration. Neurological involvement is a key area of concern with vaccines.\n* **Medications:** Keppra, Prozac, Clonazepam, Meloxicam, plus supplements.  These need to be factored in as potential interactions or influencing factors.  (Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine, which can have interactions.)\n* **Autoimmune Disease:** Diagnosed Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) currently well-managed.  Undiagnosed autoimmune process causing episcleritis and inflammatory markers (high ESR/CRP).  This is significant, as the autoimmune system is already activated.\n* **Flu Shot Reaction:**  Neurological reaction following a flu shot post-GBS is *critical* information. This is the biggest red flag regarding vaccine safety for *you*.\n* **COVID Concerns:** You\u2019re rightly concerned about COVID infection, especially given your health profile.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of things to consider, broken down into sections:**\n\n**1. The Risks of COVID-19 Infection *For You*:**\n\n* **Severity:**  Given your weight, and potentially underlying autoimmune activity, you're at higher risk for more severe COVID-19 illness, including hospitalization and complications.  \n* **\"Long COVID\":**  Even a mild COVID infection can lead to long-term symptoms, potentially exacerbating your autoimmune issues or causing new ones.\n* **Impact on Existing Conditions:**  COVID can potentially flare up your HS or worsen your undiagnosed autoimmune condition.\n* **Neurological Implications:**  COVID itself has been linked to neurological complications, even in those without prior neurological history.\n\n**2. The Risks of COVID Vaccination *For You* (Given your history):**\n\nThis is where it gets complicated. Your post-flu shot reaction is the biggest concern.\n\n* **GBS Recurrence:** While *rare*, there have been reported cases of GBS occurring after COVID vaccines (especially the J&J/Janssen vaccine, though cases have been reported with mRNA vaccines too). The risk is considered extremely low, but it's higher in individuals with a history of GBS.  The CDC and other health organizations monitor this closely.\n* **Autoimmune Flare:**  Vaccines *can* sometimes trigger autoimmune flares in people with pre-existing autoimmune conditions.  The risk is difficult to quantify, and varies based on the specific condition and the individual. Your undiagnosed autoimmune process makes this harder to predict.\n* **Neurological Reactions:** The flu shot reaction suggests you *might* be more susceptible to neurological side effects from vaccines.  It's important to understand *what* that reaction was (exactly what symptoms? how long did they last?).\n* **Vaccine Type:** mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) and the viral vector vaccine (J&J/Janssen) have different risk profiles. The J&J vaccine has been more strongly linked to GBS (though still rare), while mRNA vaccines have more common but generally milder side effects.  (J&J is less common now anyway.)\n* **Keppra Interaction:**  There are usually no direct major interactions between Keppra and the COVID vaccines, but it's always good to verify with your doctor.\n\n\n\n**3. Key Questions to Ask Your Rheumatologist Tomorrow:**\n\nThis is the most important part.  *Go prepared with a list.*\n\n* **Regarding the Flu Shot Reaction:** \"Can you help me understand *why* I had a neurological reaction to the flu shot? Was it likely a true autoimmune response, or something else? What specific characteristics of this reaction are most concerning in the context of the COVID vaccine?\"\n* **Regarding Autoimmune Risk:** \"Given my undiagnosed autoimmune process and elevated inflammatory markers, what is your assessment of the risk of a COVID vaccine triggering a flare?  What steps can be taken to mitigate that risk?\"\n* **Regarding GBS Risk:** \"What is your feeling about the risk of GBS recurrence with the mRNA vaccines versus the J&J vaccine, given my history? Do you believe the benefit outweighs the risk?\"\n* **Vaccine Choice:** \"Based on my history, which COVID vaccine would you recommend (or not recommend) and why? Do you think a booster is recommended? What about a bivalent booster?\"\n* **Monitoring:** \"If I do get vaccinated, what monitoring should be done? For how long after vaccination should I be vigilant for any new symptoms?\" (Discuss things like reporting new weakness, numbness, tingling, eye issues, joint pain, etc.)\n* **Proactive Management:** \"Are there any medications I could temporarily adjust or therapies I could consider *before* vaccination to potentially reduce the risk of an autoimmune flare?\" (Don't expect a definitive answer here, but it's worth asking.)\n* **Alternative Strategies:** \"If vaccination is deemed too risky, what alternative strategies would you recommend to protect me from severe COVID-19? (e.g. early treatment options like Paxlovid).\"\n\n**4. Your Neurologist\u2019s Stance:**\n\nYour neurologist is advocating for vaccination. Ask them *why* specifically, given your history. What\u2019s their risk/benefit analysis?  Are they concerned about the neurological risks of COVID outweighing the vaccine risks?  It\u2019s helpful to get their perspective alongside the Rheumi's.\n\n**5. Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Time since GBS:** The further you are removed from your GBS episode, the *generally* lower the risk of recurrence (though it's not a guarantee).  It's been over a decade for you.\n* **Individual Variability:**  Everyone responds to vaccines differently.  There's no way to predict with certainty how *you* will react.\n* **Shared Decision-Making:**  This should be a collaborative decision between you and your doctors.  You have the right to express your concerns and make the choice that feels right for you.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Information:** [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html)\n* **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Foundation:** [https://www.gbsfid.org/](https://www.gbsfid.org/)  (May have info on vaccine considerations)\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and discussion purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  You must consult with qualified healthcare professionals for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nGood luck with your appointment tomorrow.  Be prepared, ask questions, and advocate for your own health!  Let me know if you have any other questions I can help you prepare for."

        "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you are absolutely right to be deeply concerned and to advocate for your boyfriend. Your background as a mental health researcher gives you a strong foundation for recognizing that something is profoundly *not* aligning with a simple \"panic disorder\" diagnosis. The symptom presentation is far too complex and neurologically-involved to be dismissed so readily, especially given the history. This is a really difficult situation, compounded by a frustratingly unresponsive medical system. Here's a breakdown of my thoughts and advice, divided into sections. **Please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**1. Why a Neurological Workup is *Crucial***\n\nYour boyfriend's symptoms point strongly toward a need for a neurological evaluation. Here's why:\n\n*   **Neurological Symptoms Overlap:** The loss of balance, slurred speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades, and fainting are *not* typical panic attack symptoms. While anxiety can *cause* dizziness, the combination and severity here are highly suggestive of a neurological issue.\n*   **Duration and Frequency:** Panic attacks typically peak within 10 minutes and subside within an hour. 3-6 *hour* episodes occurring multiple times a week are atypical.\n*   **Post-Event Amnesia:** The fact that he barely remembers these episodes is concerning.  Amnesia related to these events could indicate neurological disruption.\n*   **History & Progression:**  The onset of balance and speech issues *before* the exacerbation of anxiety makes it less likely this is purely psychological.  The issue seems to have begun physically and the anxiety is a *response* to it.\n*   **Negative Tests Don't Rule Everything Out:** A single negative MRI and EEG don't exclude all neurological possibilities. Certain conditions are intermittent or require specialized imaging/testing to detect.\n\n\n\n**2. Possible Neurological Conditions to Consider (Not for Self-Diagnosis - just to illustrate complexity)**\n\nI am *not* diagnosing! But these are possibilities a neurologist might investigate:\n\n*   **Migraine with Aura:**  Some migraines present with significant neurological symptoms *beyond* headache (dizziness, speech difficulties, vision changes, confusion, even weakness). These can be prolonged and sometimes misdiagnosed as panic.\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** Though the MRI was negative for stroke, TIAs (mini-strokes) can have subtle or temporary findings on initial imaging. Repeated TIAs or atypical presentations are possible.\n*   **Vestibular Disorders:** Problems with the inner ear and vestibular system can cause dizziness, imbalance, nausea, and even cognitive difficulties.\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  This is a *diagnosis of exclusion* (meaning other causes must be ruled out first).  It involves neurological symptoms that *aren\u2019t* explained by structural disease, but are real and debilitating. It can be triggered by trauma and co-occur with anxiety/depression, *but* it still requires a neurologist to diagnose.\n*   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**  Rare but important to consider, this involves inflammation of the brain caused by the immune system. Symptoms can be variable and often include psychiatric symptoms alongside neurological ones.\n*   **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Very rare but should be considered with unexplained neurological symptoms.\n\n**3. Navigating the Canadian Healthcare System**\n\nThis is where it gets tough. You're right, the system can be incredibly difficult to navigate. Here's a battle plan:\n\n*   **Document Everything:** Meticulously document *every* symptom, when it occurs, its duration, and any potential triggers.  Record videos (with his consent, if possible) of him experiencing the symptoms \u2013 especially the speech slurring, eye movements, and balance issues. This is powerful evidence to show doctors.\n*   **Emergency Room - Be Assertive:**  I know you've been to the ER, but *go back*.  This time, be extremely assertive.  Bring your documented symptom log and videos.  Specifically request a neurological consult *while in the ER*, stating the urgency due to the severity and neurological nature of the symptoms.  If they dismiss it again, *ask to speak to the ER physician-in-charge.*  Be firm that you are not satisfied with a \"just anxiety\" diagnosis.\n*   **Independent Assessment/ Second Opinion:** Try to get a referral through a local community health center, even if it's a long wait.  Sometimes they have more flexibility. \n*   **Patient Advocate:** Explore if Quebec has any patient advocacy organizations that can assist you in navigating the healthcare system and advocating for your boyfriend's needs.  (Search \"patient advocate Quebec\" or \"healthcare navigation Quebec.\")\n*   **Formal Complaint:** If the psychiatrist continues to be dismissive, consider filing a formal complaint with the Quebec College of Physicians. This might prompt a review of his care.\n\n**4. Regarding the Current Treatment**\n\n*   **Lyrica (Pregabalin):**  While it can be used for anxiety, it's often more appropriate for nerve pain and certain seizure disorders. Lowering the dose *without* a clear reason is concerning, given his symptoms.\n*   **Silexan (Lavender Oil):** This is a very weak intervention for the level of distress he\u2019s experiencing. The fact the doctor prescribed it, *and* it\u2019s unavailable, is frankly subpar care.\n*    **Ativan (Lorazepam):** His request for Ativan was reasonable, as it can offer temporary relief during acute episodes, while figuring out the underlying causation. The refusal is concerning.\n\n**5. Supporting Your Boyfriend**\n\n*   **Validate His Experience:**  It\u2019s crucial that you continue to validate his experience and believe him, even when doctors don't. Your support is invaluable.\n*   **Encourage Self-Care (as much as possible):** Even small things \u2013 gentle walks, relaxing activities \u2013 can help manage stress.\n*   **Mental Health Support for You:** Please, please take care of yourself. This is incredibly stressful.  Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're right to feel like that's a massive coincidence and ask questions! It's absolutely good parenting to be inquisitive and advocate for your son when something feels off. Let's break down the situation, looking at the Chiari malformation, the epilepsy, the connection (or lack thereof, according to doctors), and what questions you might want to ask.  I will preface this with a **DISCLAIMER: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals. You *must* discuss these concerns with your son's neurologist and neurosurgeon.**\n\n**Understanding the Pieces**\n\n* **Chiari Malformation (specifically, a Chiari I Malformation, likely given the tonsillar descent):** This is a structural defect where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal.  A descent of 15mm is *significant*.  The cerebellum and brainstem are often involved. Symptoms can vary *widely*.  Some people with large Chiari malformations have *no* symptoms, while others can have debilitating ones. Common symptoms (which often evolve over time) may include:\n    * Headaches (often worsened by coughing, straining, or exertion)\n    * Neck pain\n    * Balance problems\n    * Muscle weakness\n    * Numbness or tingling in hands and feet\n    * Difficulty swallowing\n    * Vision problems\n    * **And, importantly, seizures (though less common as a primary presentation)**\n* **Generalized Epilepsy:** This means the seizures start in both sides of the brain, rather than just one area. Keppra (levetiracetam) is a common first-line medication for generalized epilepsy.  The fact that he responded to Keppra is good, meaning the medication is controlling the seizure activity.\n* **The Timing:** Diagnosis of epilepsy in December, and a significant Chiari found in February *is* a short timeframe. It makes a connection feel much more plausible.\n\n\n\n**Why Doctors Might Say They're Unrelated (and why you're smart to question it)**\n\nDoctors often approach things looking for the *most likely* explanation first. Here's why they might initially say they're unrelated:\n\n* **Epilepsy has many causes:**  A lot of childhood epilepsy is idiopathic (unknown cause).  They may be leaning toward a genetic predisposition or a subtle brain injury that wasn't visible on imaging.\n* **Chiari can be asymptomatic:**  As mentioned, many people *have* a Chiari malformation and never know it.  The doctors might be downplaying the Chiari as incidental finding, particularly if your son isn't exhibiting classic Chiari symptoms *right now*.\n* **Correlation vs. Causation:** Just because two things happen around the same time doesn\u2019t mean one *caused* the other. It's a fundamental principle of medicine.\n* **Difficult to Prove a Connection:** Establishing a definitive causal link between a Chiari and epilepsy can be extremely challenging. \n\n**However\u2026 Why a Connection *Could* Exist (and why you're right to wonder)**\n\nWhile the doctors may be right, here's why your intuition is valid, and why a connection is possible, even if not fully understood:\n\n* **Chiari Can Cause Epilepsy:** While not the *most* common cause of epilepsy, Chiari malformations *can* lead to seizures.  The way it works is complex:\n    * **Compression:** The cerebellar tonsils pressing down on the brainstem can disrupt normal brain function, potentially triggering seizures.\n    * **CSF Flow Obstruction:** Chiari can sometimes obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can lead to increased pressure in the brain and contribute to seizures.\n    * **Disruption of Neural Networks:** The malformation itself can disrupt normal neural pathways.\n* **Severity Matters:** A 15mm descent is *significant*. It's not a minor finding.  The larger the malformation, the more likely it is to cause symptoms, including neurological ones like epilepsy.\n* **Age of Onset:** 2.5 years is relatively young for epilepsy to develop *de novo* (newly).  While it certainly happens, it raises the question of an underlying structural cause.\n* **The Coincidence:** You are right to say it\u2019s a coincidence! This is something doctors should investigate further.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Need to Ask Your Doctors**\n\nHere is a list of questions to bring to your son's neurologist and, ideally, a *pediatric neurosurgeon* experienced with Chiari malformations:\n\n**To the Neurologist:**\n\n*   \u201cGiven the timing of the epilepsy diagnosis and the Chiari discovery, how thoroughly did we explore a potential link during the diagnostic workup?\u201d\n*   \u201cWhat specific tests were done to rule out the Chiari as a contributing factor to the seizures?\u201d (Specifically ask about EEG findings concerning the location of the seizure activity)\n*   \"Are there any specific seizure types that are more commonly associated with Chiari malformations?\" (And does his seizure type fit?)\n*   \u201cIf the Keppra effectively controls the seizures, does that definitively rule out the Chiari as a cause?\u201d (The answer should be *no* - medication controlling symptoms doesn't mean the underlying cause is gone.)\n*   \u201cWhat are the potential long-term effects of *untreated* Chiari in a child?\u201d\n*   \"What monitoring (EEG, neurological exams) should we be doing to watch for any changes in his epilepsy or new neurological symptoms?\"\n\n**To the Pediatric Neurosurgeon (critical to see one!)**\n\n*   \u201cGiven the 15mm descent, do you consider this a clinically significant Chiari malformation, even if my son isn't currently exhibiting classic Chiari symptoms?\u201d\n*   \u201cWhat is your opinion on the potential relationship between his Chiari and his epilepsy?\u201d *Be direct.*\n*   \u201cWhat are the potential benefits and risks of monitoring versus surgical intervention in his case?\u201d (Discuss this even if surgery isn\u2019t currently recommended).\n*   \u201cWhat specific symptoms would prompt you to recommend surgical intervention?\u201d\n*   \u201cWhat imaging modalities are best to assess the flow of CSF in his case and identify any obstruction?\u201d (MRI with cine flow studies).\n*    \u201cHow frequently should we monitor the Chiari with repeat MRI scans?\u201d\n*   \u201cAre there any specialists (e.g., a pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy and structural brain abnormalities) you would recommend we consult?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Second Opinion:**  Don't hesitate to get a second opinion from a different pediatric neurosurgeon.\n*   **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of your son\u2019s seizures (date, time, duration, what happened before, during, and after), any symptoms you observe, and all your conversations with doctors.\n*   **Advocate for Your Son:** You know your son best. If you feel something isn't right, keep asking questions until you get answers that satisfy you.\n\n\n\n\n**In conclusion:** Your concerns are valid. A 15mm Chiari descent is significant, especially with the relatively recent onset of epilepsy. While the doctors may be right that they are unrelated, you are absolutely right to push for a thorough investigation of a potential connection and a clear plan for monitoring and management.  **Schedule an appointment with a pediatric neurosurgeon as soon as possible.**\n\n\n\nI hope this comprehensive response helps.  Please remember to always prioritize the advice of your medical team.  Good luck \u2013 you are doing a great job being a concerned and proactive parent."

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That *is* a lot of history, and understandably frustrating after 5 years of searching for answers! It's good you've documented so much yourself \u2013 that's incredibly valuable information. And apologies if our forum *was* down, it's good to have you back (if it was!).  It's also good you\u2019re proactively sharing this information \u2013 navigating medical mysteries often requires a lot of self-advocacy.\n\nLet's break this down. You've been *very* thorough in what's been ruled out, and that's important.  The details you're adding now, particularly the progression of the double vision, and the return of neuropathy *despite* normal Vitamin D/parathyroid, are key. Here's a detailed response, broken down into potential avenues, and advice.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**1. Re-Evaluating Neurological Considerations (Even Though You've Been)**\n\nYou're resistant to going back to a neurologist, and I understand the cost concerns. However, the *change* in your symptoms warrants another look. Here's why:\n\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs).** These are \"mini-strokes,\" often caused by temporary blood flow disruptions.  While you\u2019ve had blood pressure checked, TIAs can occur even with normal blood pressure, especially if there's an underlying vascular issue (like a small vessel problem, or even a subtle valve issue in the heart). The fact that the double vision *worsened* recently and was temporarily alleviated in one eye is concerning and can align with this, although not common.\n*   **Demyelinating Disease (MS-like presentations).** While you\u2019ve been screened for this, atypical presentations exist. The return of the neuropathy, even with normal Vitamin D, adds a layer of suggestion to this. The episodic nature, the time frame, all fit a possible demyelinating pattern.  Advanced MRI techniques (see point 4) might be considered if a neurologist felt it warranted.\n*   **Brainstem Involvement:**  The consistent 40-minute duration, and the disorientation preceding the vision changes, point to something relatively 'stable' within the neurological system cycling on and off. The brainstem is involved in vision, balance, and general awareness. Subtle issues in this region can cause episodic neurological symptoms.\n\n**2. The Concussion History**\n\nWhile you say they were minor, *three* concussions as a child are significant. Even without LOC (loss of consciousness), concussions can cause subtle, long-term neurological changes. Post-concussion syndrome can manifest in many ways, and sometimes symptoms emerge years later.  This doesn't necessarily *explain* the double vision, but it's a relevant piece of the puzzle. The history of benzo use alongside this complicates things, as it can mask or mimic neurological symptoms. \n\n**3. The Peripheral Neuropathy Return**\n\nThe fact that neuropathy has returned despite normal Vitamin D and parathyroid is *very* important.  This suggests something *else* is going on. Possible avenues to explore:\n\n*   **Small Fiber Neuropathy:** This often doesn't show up on standard nerve conduction studies. It involves damage to the small nerve fibers responsible for pain, temperature, and autonomic function. It's often *idiopathic* (unknown cause), but can be associated with autoimmune conditions. (see point 5)\n*   **Autoimmune Screen:**  Given the neuropathy, and the possibility of demyelination, a thorough autoimmune panel is vital.  This would check for antibodies associated with various autoimmune disorders that can affect the nervous system.\n* **Heavy Metal Testing:** Though less common, neurological symptoms can sometimes be caused by heavy metal toxicity.\n\n**4. Advanced Imaging**\n\nYou\u2019ve had brain imaging, but consider asking about:\n\n*   **High-Resolution MRI with Contrast:**  A more detailed scan, specifically looking for subtle lesions, areas of inflammation, or vascular abnormalities.\n*  **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI):** This can detect subtle disruptions in white matter tracts in the brain which can be associated with concussions or demyelinating diseases, even if they are not obvious on conventional MRI.\n\n**5.  Consider an Immunological/Rheumatological Workup**\n\nBased on borderline symptoms, an autoimmune or rheumatological assessment could be useful. Conditions like lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, or vasculitis can sometimes present with neurological symptoms *before* other obvious signs appear. This is especially important now that your neuropathy has returned.\n\n**6. Detailed Symptom Journaling**\n\nYou're already doing this, which is great. Continue it! *Specifically* track:\n\n*   **Stress Levels:** How were you feeling emotionally in the few days leading up to an episode?\n*   **Sleep Quality:**  Were you well-rested?\n*   **Light Exposure:** (Beyond just \"September-April\").  Were you exposed to bright artificial light right before an episode?  (Fluorescent lights, screen time).\n*   **Any other accompanying symptoms:** Headaches, subtle changes in taste or smell, fatigue, muscle weakness etc.\n\n**7. Second/Third Opinion - Specialized Neurologist**\n\nIf you can afford it, seek a consultation with a neurologist who *specializes* in neuro-ophthalmology (vision problems related to the nervous system) or complex neurological disorders. A fresh set of eyes, with a specialized focus, may see something others missed.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Your individual situation is unique, and a thorough evaluation by a doctor is crucial to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Be sure to communicate *all* of your symptoms and health history to your doctor.\n\n\n\n**To help me refine my suggestions, could you tell me:**\n\n*   **What type of neurologist did you see previously?** (General? Subspecialized?)\n*   **Have you ever had a full-body MRI?**\n*   **How is your overall energy level?**  Are you generally fatigued, or do you feel well aside from these episodes?\n*   **Is the neuropathy symmetrical?** (Affecting both arms/legs equally?)\n\n\n\nI truly hope you get some answers.  It's exhausting to live with unexplained symptoms. Please keep advocating for yourself, and don't give up on finding a solution."

        "question": "My little brother has random faint spells (or mini epileptic attacks, we are not sure). We want to help him lose weight as that alone would improve his quality of life by itself but the biggest issue we have is that he falls very frequently and he is very heavy. Up until now every fall he has had has not resulted in a major injury thankfull but its bound to happen. I was wondering. Is there a cage/walker product that allows us to take him on walks and would catch him via a harness should he fall? This walker/cage bungee cord contraption would have to be able to hold the sudden shock of 250 lbs of deadweight when he has his faint spells. Please let me know if you know of such a device or what the name is.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very serious and understandably concerning situation. You're right to be proactive about both his health *and* safety. It's excellent that you're thinking about enabling more activity while mitigating the risk of falls.  It's crucial to approach this with a medical team's guidance. I will give you information on devices, **but please read the important disclaimer at the end**.\n\n**The Core Challenge \u2013 and Why it's Hard to Find a \"Perfect\" Solution**\n\nYou've hit the nail on the head with the weight and the sudden 'deadweight' issue.  It's extremely difficult to create a device that can instantaneously *and* safely absorb the impact of a 250lb (113kg) person losing consciousness and going limp.  The forces involved are huge.  Many devices marketed as fall prevention or support aren't designed for that type of sudden, complete loss of stability.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of options, ranging from standard to more specialized, with considerations for your brother's situation.  I'll focus on those with some level of harness/support integration.  I'll also indicate approximate price ranges (USD), but these can vary *significantly* based on features and vendor.**\n\n**1. Standard Walkers with Harness Adaptations (Least Specialized, Most Affordable):**\n\n*   **Standard Walker:** (~$50 - $150)  These provide basic stability.  However, they *won't* catch a fall if your brother fully collapses.\n*   **Walker with Forearm Supports:** (~$75 - $200)  More stable than standard walkers.  Help with posture and weight distribution.\n*   **Harness Addition:** *This is where it gets tricky.* You can *sometimes* find harnesses that can be *attached* to a walker. *However*, these are typically designed for preventing wandering (dementia care) or providing gentle postural support, *not* absorbing a full-body collapse.  **The walker frame itself will likely bend or break under a 250lb sudden impact.**\n    *   **Consider:** Look for adjustable harnesses with wider straps and robust attachment points. But again, understand limitations.\n*   **Pros:** Affordable, readily available.\n*   **Cons:** Likely insufficient for truly preventing injury from sudden collapses.  Risk of walker damage.\n\n**2.  Gait Trainers (More Specialized):**\n\n*   **What they are:** Gait trainers are designed to help individuals relearn to walk or maintain mobility, particularly after injury or neurological events.  Many have a supportive frame and a harness system.\n*   **Suspension-Based Gait Trainers:** (~$500 - $3000+) These are the closest to what you're envisioning. They use a harness suspended *from* the frame. *Some* higher-end models have some degree of shock absorption in the suspension system.  \n    *   **Key Feature to Look For:**  \"Dynamic suspension\" or \"variable resistance\" - these indicate some ability to absorb forces. Look for models rated for his weight *with a significant safety margin*.\n* **Upright Walker/Gait Trainer:** (~$1000 - $5000) Newer designs that offer more upright support, making walking feel more natural. Some models may have a harness option.\n*   **Pros:**  More supportive than a basic walker. Harness integration. Some models have shock absorption. Encourages proper gait.\n* **Cons:** Expensive.  May still not be sufficient for a complete, sudden collapse, depending on the suspension system.  Require professional fitting.  Can be bulky.\n\n**3.  Fall-Prevention Harness Systems (Most Specialized, Potentially Most Effective - but also most complex):**\n\n*   **Industrial Fall Arrest Harnesses (Modified):** (~$150 - $500+ for harness, plus additional cost for a suitable frame/system)  These are what construction workers use. *However*, they are designed for *stopping* a fall from a height, not for quickly absorbing impact at ground level.  Using one would require significant modification and expertise to create a safe system. *This is NOT something to attempt without professional engineering and medical guidance.*\n*   **Soft Fall Harnesses for Therapy (Rare/Custom):**  These are specialized harnesses used in some physical and occupational therapy settings. They are designed to allow a safe, controlled descent.  They are *very* expensive and usually only available through specialized medical equipment suppliers.  \n*   **Custom-Built Systems:** This is likely the only way to achieve exactly what you want \u2013 a frame and harness combination specifically engineered to absorb the impact of a 250lb deadweight fall. *This would involve working with an engineer specializing in biomechanics and safety equipment.* (Cost: Very high - potentially $5,000+)\n*   **Pros:** Potentially the most protective.\n*   **Cons:**  Very expensive, complex, requires professional assessment and potential customization. Industrial harnesses may not be suitable without major modification.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations & Questions to Ask:**\n\n*   **Weight Capacity:**  *Always* choose a device with a weight capacity *well above* your brother's weight (at least 20-30% higher).\n*   **Harness Fit:** A properly fitted harness is *essential*.  It should be snug but not restrictive.\n*   **Shock Absorption:**  Inquire about the specific shock absorption capabilities of any system you consider.  Ask for data or testing reports.\n* **Adjustability:** Ensure the device is highly adjustable to accommodate his height, arm length and gait.\n*   **Professional Assessment:**  A physical therapist or occupational therapist *must* assess your brother's needs and recommend appropriate equipment.\n*   **Training:**  You and your brother will need proper training on how to use the device safely.\n* **Surface:** The surface you are walking on matters. Soft surfaces like grass will always be better than concrete.\n\n\n\n**Crucially Important Disclaimer:**\n\n**I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. The information above is for general informational purposes only and should not be taken as a substitute for professional medical consultation.  Your brother's condition sounds complex, and it's imperative you:**\n\n1.  **Consult his neurologist or the doctor managing his condition.** They need to be fully aware of your plans and help determine the safest course of action.  They may want to investigate the cause of the spells further.\n2.  **Work with a physical therapist (PT) and/or occupational therapist (OT).** They can assess his gait, balance, and strength, and recommend the most appropriate assistive devices.  They can also provide training in safe transfer techniques.\n3.  **Do NOT attempt to build or modify any equipment yourself without the guidance of a qualified engineer.**  A poorly designed system could cause serious injury.\n4. **Understand that no device can *guarantee* complete fall prevention.** The goal is to *reduce* the risk of injury.\n\n\n\n\n**To help me give you more specific advice, could you tell me:**\n\n*   **What is the known or suspected cause of his spells?** (Even if it's \"unknown,\" that's helpful to know.)\n*   **What is his current level of mobility?**  Can he walk independently at all, even with a standard walker?\n*   **What type of surfaces will he be walking on?** (e.g., flat pavement, grass, uneven terrain)\n*   **What is his height and weight?** (You've given weight, but height is important for harness fit.)\n\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope you find a solution that allows your brother to safely enjoy more activity.  It's wonderful that you're so dedicated to his well-being."

Its location is specified as Segment 6 of the right lobe of the liver (the numbers in parentheses refer to the specific slice location on the MRI).\n* **\"No definite washout however the lesions appear to enhance less then background vessels on delayed phases, arguing against hemangioma.\"** Hemangiomas are very common benign (non-cancerous) liver lesions. They typically show a very characteristic pattern of *washout* on MRI - they brightly light up initially, then fade or \"wash out\" over time.  These lesions don't show that clear washout pattern, making a simple hemangioma less likely.  The fact they enhance *less* than normal blood vessels is also unusual for a hemangioma.\n* **\"Imaging features suggest adenoma with the differential including focal nodular hyperplasia.\"** This is the core of the report. The radiologist is suggesting two main possibilities:\n    * **Hepatic Adenoma:** This is a *benign* (non-cancerous) tumor that arises from liver cells.  They are more common in women, often linked to oral contraceptive use (like Yaz), and can sometimes grow or bleed, but are rarely cancerous.\n    * **Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):**  This is also a *benign* condition. It's not a true tumor, but more of a localized area of abnormally developed liver tissue.  FNH is generally considered very low risk.\n\n**What Does This Mean? Is it Something to Worry About?**\n\nGenerally, **the first impression from this report is *less concerning* than it might initially seem**. Both adenoma and FNH are benign conditions.  However, *any* lesion in the liver needs to be investigated to be sure. \n\nHere's a breakdown of worry levels:\n\n* **Low Worry:** The report specifically rules out features strongly suggestive of malignancy.  The lesions are not behaving like cancer.\n* **Moderate Worry:**  Adenomas *can* have a small risk of bleeding or, very rarely, malignant transformation (becoming cancerous). The size of the dominant lesion (1.8 cm) isn't huge, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n* **Need for Further Evaluation:** The main goal now is to determine *which* of the two possibilities (adenoma or FNH) is more likely, and potentially rule out other rarer possibilities.\n\n\n\n**What Happens Next? (Expected Follow-Up)**\n\nYou will almost certainly need further evaluation. Here's what's likely:\n\n1. **Consultation with a Hepatologist (Liver Specialist):**  This is the most important step.  A hepatologist is the best person to interpret the imaging in the context of your medical history.  Given your pancreatitis history, this is especially important.\n2. **Further Imaging:** Depending on the hepatologist's assessment, they might order *another* MRI, possibly with a different MRI protocol specifically designed to differentiate between adenoma and FNH.  Sometimes they use a type of MRI called a \"hepatobiliary phase\" scan.\n3. **Blood Tests:**  Blood tests to assess your liver function and rule out other conditions.\n4. **Possibly Biopsy:**  In some cases, a liver biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion for analysis) may be necessary to get a definitive diagnosis. This is not always needed, and the hepatologist will determine if it's appropriate.\n\n**Regarding Your Medications and Medical History:**\n\n* **Yaz:** The report specifically mentions adenoma and oral contraceptive use.  Yaz (and other combined oral contraceptives) are associated with a slightly increased risk of hepatic adenoma.  This is why it's noted.\n* **Chronic Pancreatitis & TP/AIT:**  These are relevant to your overall health and potentially to how the liver handles certain substances, which is why your complete medical history is important.\n* **Other Medications:** Your list of medications is complex.  The hepatologist will review it to see if any could potentially affect the liver.\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general understanding only and should *not* be considered a substitute for professional medical evaluation and guidance.  **You MUST discuss these findings with your doctor (especially a hepatologist) to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.**  They have your complete medical history and can interpret the results in the best context.  Do not self-treat or make any changes to your medication without consulting your doctor.\n\n\n\n**To help your doctor, write down any questions you have before your appointment. Some good questions to ask might be:**\n\n* What is the most likely diagnosis based on the MRI findings and my medical history?\n* What further tests do you recommend, and why?\n* What are the risks and benefits of each recommended test?\n* If it is an adenoma, what are the monitoring recommendations? When would treatment be needed?\n* How does my medication list affect this situation?\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps you feel a little more informed and prepared for your next appointment.  I wish you the best of health!"

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a profoundly stressful situation, and your fear is completely understandable given the trauma and then the unexpected seizures, followed by these new symptoms. It's good you're seeking information and trying to be observant. Let's break this down, focusing on addressing your concerns, but *please read the disclaimer at the very end.*  I cannot diagnose your wife. This is a discussion of possibilities and what questions to ask the doctor.\n\n**Understanding the Situation - A Recap**\n\n* **Postpartum Seizures:** Seizures happening *after* delivery, particularly in the postpartum period, are complex. They can be triggered by a number of things. Your wife's case is particularly concerning because her seizures started relatively late (6 days postpartum).\n* **Spinal Anesthesia as a Possible Cause:** The initial theory \u2013 spinal anesthesia causing a rare neurological reaction \u2013 is a reasonable starting point, especially given the timing. However, as the ongoing symptoms suggest, it may not be the *complete* picture.\n* **Initial Investigations:** CSF analysis and MRI being normal is good, lessening the chances of obvious stroke, infection or a large structural lesion. The \"activity\" noted on the MRI in the frontal lobe warrants further consideration.\n* **Phenytoin:** This medication helps to control seizures by stabilizing nerve activity. The initial high dose was appropriate for controlling acute seizures, but decreasing it based on symptom improvement is standard practice.\n* **New Symptoms:**  This is where the situation becomes more complex. The light sensitivity, blurry vision, deep sleep, itching, and vibrations are all concerning and may or may not be directly related to the initial seizures or the medication.\n* **Memory Gaps:** The memory loss around the seizures is expected (postictal amnesia).  The gaps in memory regarding the journey to the hospital are more concerning and need to be investigated.\n\n\n\n**Addressing Your Specific Concerns & Potential Causes (Not a Diagnosis!)**\n\nLet's look at each symptom and potential links, knowing we're navigating possibilities without a full clinical picture.\n\n* **Light Sensitivity & Blurry Vision:** This can be a migraine aura, a side effect of medication (especially phenytoin), or related to neurological processing issues. The fact that it\u2019s worse when sleepy/waking up is significant.\n* **Deep Sleep:**  Phenytoin *can* cause sedation.  It\u2019s good the dose was lowered, but it could still be contributing. However, extreme difficulty waking someone up is *always* a red flag and should be discussed with the doctor.  It needs to be ruled out that this isn\u2019t a sign of subtle neurological changes.\n* **Itching (Pruritus):**  This is a significant development since the dose reduction. Phenytoin is known to sometimes cause skin rashes and itching, although it's not the most common side effect. However, the intensity you describe \u2013 causing bed vibrations - is unusual for a simple drug reaction.  Itching *can* be a symptom of neurological conditions, including those affecting the central nervous system.\n* **Vibrations/Shaking:**  The hand vibrations while sleeping and now the feeling of vibration in the right side of the body are disturbing. These could be myoclonus (brief, involuntary muscle jerks) \u2013 which *can* be a side effect of phenytoin, but could also be indicative of other neurological issues. The right-sided sensation is particularly concerning if it's new.\n* **Memory Loss:** You're right to be concerned. While postictal amnesia is expected immediately after a seizure, the gaps in memory surrounding the hospital visit are noteworthy. This suggests a possible ongoing impact on cognitive function.\n\n**Regarding Your Fear of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**\n\nIt's understandable you've researched MS. Itching and vibration-like sensations, along with visual disturbances, *can* be symptoms of MS.  However, MS is a complex diagnosis that requires specific criteria (including evidence of lesions in multiple areas of the brain and spinal cord on MRI \u2013 which her initial MRI didn't show). *Don't jump to conclusions*.  The symptoms overlap with many other conditions.\n\n* **Why MS is *less* likely at this point:**  The relatively acute onset after the C-section and initial spinal anesthesia makes MS less likely as a first explanation. MS typically develops more gradually.  The lack of definitive findings on the MRI is also against it.\n* **Why it can't be ruled out entirely:** MS can sometimes present atypically. And just because the first MRI was clear doesn\u2019t rule it out entirely, as lesions can develop over time.\n\n\n\n\n**What You *Absolutely* Need to Do (Action Plan)**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE Contact with the Doctor:**  Do not wait for a scheduled appointment. Call the doctor *today*. Emphasize the new and worsening symptoms:\n    * The intensity of the itching.\n    * The vibrations/shaking \u2013 specifically the new right-sided sensation.\n    * The difficulty waking her up.\n    * The memory lapses.\n    * Your overall anxiety and concern.\n\n2. **Specific Questions for the Doctor:**\n    *   \u201cCould the itching be a severe side effect of the Phenytoin, even at this lower dose?\u201d\n    *   \u201cWhat other causes could explain the itching, vibrations, and changes in sleep?\u201d\n    *   \u201dGiven the ongoing symptoms, should we consider more advanced neurological testing, such as a repeat MRI with contrast, or an EEG (electroencephalogram)?\u201d\n    *   \"Could this be something like Postpartum Stroke/reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)?\" (This is a rare but important consideration in postpartum seizures)\n    *   \u201cIs there any risk of neurological damage from the initial seizures or the spinal anesthesia that could be causing these issues?\u201d\n    *   \"Could these symptoms be indicative of a different neurological condition?\" (Don't be afraid to explicitly ask about MS, but stress you\u2019re seeking information, not self-diagnosing).\n    *  \"Should a neurology consult be scheduled?\" (This is very important.)\n\n3. **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:**  Document *everything*:\n    *   When symptoms occur.\n    *   How long they last.\n    *   What seems to trigger them.\n    *   The severity (e.g., on a scale of 1-10).\n    *   Any changes in mood or behavior.\n\n4. **Consider a Second Opinion:** Do not hesitate to seek a second opinion from a neurologist, especially one specializing in postpartum neurological conditions.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n* **You are doing the right thing by being vigilant.** Your concern for your wife is commendable.\n* **Trust your instincts.** If you feel something is seriously wrong, push for further investigation.\n* **Advocate for your wife.** She may be overwhelmed and unable to advocate for herself effectively.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute. The dizziness is fading a little now, and I think its been about 10 minutes, though I have a light headache.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds genuinely unsettling, and it's good you've been documenting it. It's also smart to acknowledge you're feeling a bit off right now \u2013 the floaty/dizzy state is impacting your ability to articulate, and that's completely understandable. Let's break this down and talk about what might be going on, and what you should do.  I'm going to give a comprehensive response, but please read the **disclaimer** at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses.\n\n**What you're describing touches on several possibilities, and needing a medical evaluation is *absolutely* the most important thing.** Here's a breakdown of the components and potential avenues to explore (with explanations geared towards non-medical language):\n\n**1. The Sensations: Deconstructing the Experience**\n\n* **Tingling/Shivering Flush:** This could be a few things. It sounds like a *paresthesia* \u2013 an abnormal sensation, often described as tingling, prickling, numbness, or burning.  It could be related to nerves, blood flow, or even a brief, minor electrical misfire in the brain.\n* **Unnamable Emotion (Dread/Deja Vu Combination):** This is key.  The emotional component is very important.  Deja vu is common, but combined with dread, it suggests something more. This can point to areas in the brain responsible for emotional processing and memory.\n* **Hyperawareness (\"Reality feels more real\"):** This is a fascinating and often reported, though rarely discussed, symptom.  It\u2019s similar to the descriptions of some altered states of consciousness.  It suggests increased sensory processing.\n* **Post-Event Headache & Dizziness:** The headache is likely a consequence of the neurological activity, or a tension headache developing *because* you're experiencing something unusual and are subconsciously stressed about it. The dizziness is more concerning & we'll get into that.\n* **Brief Duration & Infrequent Occurrence**: The fact that these are brief, infrequent, and don\u2019t seem to have lasting negative effects is somewhat reassuring, but *doesn\u2019t* rule out needing investigation.\n\n\n\n**2. Possible Causes (This is where it gets more complex \u2013 *not* a diagnosis, just possibilities to discuss with a doctor):**\n\n* **Simple Partial Seizures (Focal Seizures):**  These are seizures that affect a limited area of the brain.  They *don't* always involve convulsions or loss of consciousness. Symptoms can be extremely varied, including tingling, emotional shifts, altered perception (like the hyperawareness), and dizziness.  The fact that you're aware during these episodes makes this a more likely consideration than a full-blown seizure. *This is important to rule out*.\n* **Migraine Aura (Atypical):** You mentioned you sometimes get migraines *with* visual auras, but this feels different.  However, migraines can manifest in *many* different ways, including sensory disturbances without headache \u2013 sometimes called \"silent migraines.\" The aura itself can also cause dizziness.\n* **Vestibular Issues:**  The dizziness could be linked to problems in your inner ear (vestibular system) which controls balance. However, the other symptoms (tingling, emotion, hyperawareness) make this less likely to be *solely* a vestibular problem.\n* **Anxiety/Panic Disorder:** Anxiety can sometimes trigger physical symptoms, including tingling, dizziness, and a feeling of unreality. *However,* the specific combination and intensity you describe are not typical anxiety presentations.  It's also important to consider that anxiety could be *triggered* by these episodes, not the cause of them.\n* **Neurological Condition:** While less likely given your age and lack of other symptoms, it's essential to rule out any underlying neurological conditions.  This would be done through specific tests (see below).\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA - \"Mini-Stroke\"):**  Although you're young, it's important to mention this. TIAs can cause brief neurological symptoms. *This is a less likely scenario, but your doctor will consider it.*\n\n**3. What You Need to Do \u2013 Crucially Important**\n\n* **See a Doctor:** This isn't something to try to self-diagnose.  You need a medical evaluation.  I recommend starting with your **Primary Care Physician (PCP)**.  Explain *everything* you've told me \u2013 be as detailed as possible, and bring your written notes.  \n* **Neurological Referral:** Your PCP will likely refer you to a **Neurologist**. A neurologist specializes in the brain and nervous system.\n* **Testing:** The neurologist will likely order some tests. Here are some common ones:\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):**  This tests the electrical activity in your brain.  It's important for detecting seizures.\n    * **MRI of the Brain:** This provides detailed images of your brain to look for any structural abnormalities.\n    * **Vestibular Testing:**  If your dizziness is significant, they may do tests to assess your inner ear function.\n    * **Blood Tests:** To rule out other possible causes (e.g., vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems).\n* **Keep a Detailed Log:** Continue to document *every* episode, including:\n    * **Date and Time**\n    * **Precise Description of Sensations:** (Tingling where?  What *exactly* does the emotion feel like? What is different about the reality you're experiencing?)\n    * **Duration of Each Phase**\n    * **Triggers (if any):** Did anything happen *before* the episode?  Stress, lack of sleep, specific foods?\n    * **What you were doing during the episode**\n    * **What helps it subside**\n\n\n\n**Regarding the dizziness you're feeling *right now*:**\n\n* **Rest:**  Lie down in a quiet, dark room.\n* **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water.\n* **Avoid strenuous activity.**\n* **If the dizziness worsens or you develop new symptoms (e.g., vision changes, weakness, difficulty speaking), seek immediate medical attention (Emergency Room).**\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.  The information I\u2019ve provided is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  This information is *not* a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment.\n\n\n\nYou are taking the right steps by acknowledging something is unusual and seeking information. The fact that you're documenting it is excellent.  Don't delay in seeking medical attention.  It's likely something manageable, but it needs proper investigation.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions (though I cannot give medical advice), and I genuinely hope you get answers and relief soon."

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents.

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *lot* to unpack, and I'm really sorry you're going through this. It sounds incredibly frustrating and frightening to have your seizures return and to feel like you're navigating this medical situation poorly and alone.  Let's break down what's happening, potential explanations, and what you need to push for.  I'll address the medication issues, potential contributing factors relating to your mental health, and then deeply dive into those EEG results. **Please remember I am an AI and *cannot* give medical advice. This is for informational purposes and you absolutely need to discuss this with your neurologist as quickly as possible.**\n\n**1. Why Things Have Gone Downhill - A Multifaceted Problem**\n\nThere are several converging factors at play here:\n\n*   **Medication Management Errors:** This is the biggest, most immediate issue.  The transition from Keppra to Lamotrigine was catastrophically handled.  Dropping Keppra and starting at *25mg* Lamotrigine is a huge, abrupt change. Lamotrigine needs to be titrated *very slowly* to avoid side effects and ensure efficacy.  Your pharmacists were right to be horrified.  You were essentially left without adequate seizure control, which explains the rebound in myoclonic and then generalized seizures.  The fact you self-medicated with Keppra after running out only compounded the problem.\n*   **Misunderstood Myoclonic Seizures:** You're right to emphasize this.  Myoclonic seizures *are* seizures.  They might be subtle, but they represent abnormal brain activity. The previous neurologists dismissing them as \"not seizures\" led to premature medication withdrawal.  Your body was telling you it still needed support.\n*   **Sleep Deprivation as a Trigger:**  A clear pattern in your history.  Reduced sleep significantly increases seizure frequency for *many* people with epilepsy.\n*   **Potential Underlying Contributing Factors (Mental Health):** Your history of mental health challenges is very relevant.  I'll elaborate on this in Section 3.\n*   **Subtle EEG Changes:** Your EEG results aren't \"normal\" (despite the April 2022 report saying so \u2013 see analysis below). There's evidence of subtle abnormalities that may be contributing.\n\n\n\n**2. Medication \u2013 What Needs to Happen NOW**\n\n*   **Immediate Neurology Follow-Up:** You need to see a neurologist *as soon as possible*.  Don't wait for a scheduled appointment. Explain the situation and request an urgent appointment.\n*   **Stabilize Medication:**  The current regimen of 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra is likely insufficient given your seizure activity and the history.  *Do not change your medication on your own.*  Your neurologist needs to determine the optimal doses of each drug. \n*   **Proper Titration:** ANY changes to Lamotrigine *must* be done slowly under your neurologist's guidance. A fast increase in dosage can lead to serious skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is a rare but life-threatening possibility).\n*   **Clobazam:** Using clobazam as a \"rescue\" medication (to stop clusters of myoclonic seizures) is reasonable short-term, but it's *not* a long-term solution. The aim is to get your AEDs (Anti-Epileptic Drugs) working effectively enough to eliminate the need for rescue medication.\n\n**3. Mental Health & Epilepsy \u2013 A Complex Relationship**\n\nYour extensive history of mental health challenges is incredibly significant.  Here's how it connects to epilepsy:\n\n*   **Epilepsy and Mood Disorders:**  There's a very strong link between epilepsy and depression, anxiety, and BPD. Seizures themselves can *cause* mood disturbances, and mood disturbances can *lower* the seizure threshold (making seizures more likely).\n*   **Sleep and Mental Health:**  Poor sleep fuels both mental health issues *and* seizure activity. It's a vicious cycle.\n*   **Trauma & BPD:** If you have a history of trauma (which often underlies BPD), this can also impact brain function and potentially contribute to seizure susceptibility.\n*   **Neurodiversity and Epilepsy:** Your suspicion of being on the autism spectrum is interesting.  There\u2019s growing research showing co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy. This might impact how your brain processes information and responds to medication.\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Neurologist About Mental Health:**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Assessment:** Request a referral for a *thorough* psychiatric/psychological evaluation.  A proper diagnosis (or a ruling out of diagnoses) is essential.\n*   **Integrated Treatment:**  Your epilepsy and mental health need to be treated *together*.  This may involve coordinating care between your neurologist, psychiatrist/psychologist, and potentially a therapist.\n*   **Medication Interactions:**  Ensure any antidepressants or anxiolytics prescribed don't interact negatively with your AEDs.\n*   **Addressing Trauma:**  If trauma is a factor, consider trauma-informed therapy.\n\n\n\n**4. EEG Results \u2013 A Closer Look**\n\nLet's break down the EEG findings.  This is where the French translation becomes important.\n\n*   **April 2022 EEG (\u201cNormal Exam\u201d):** This report is simpler. It basically says the alpha rhythm is normal, delta and theta activity are absent, and there were no signs of seizures during the recording. However, this doesn\u2019t mean everything is perfectly fine. It just means no epileptiform activity was captured *at that time*.\n*   **Recent EEG:** This is more significant. Here's a detailed translation:\n\n    *   **Base Rhythm:** Alpha activity, symmetric and stable, with a stable \"fusel\u00e9\" (a term meaning \u201cspindle-shaped\" or \"tapered,\" implying a gradual change) at 9 Hz. This part is generally normal. Alpha is the dominant brainwave when relaxed with eyes closed.\n    *   **Delta Activity:** *Irregular* delta activity, bilaterally in the fronto-temporal regions (front and sides of the brain). Delta waves are slow waves typically seen in deep sleep. Seeing them while awake is abnormal. Their irregularity suggests a disruption in brain activity.\n    *   **Theta Activity:** Absent \u2013 Normal.\n    *   **Stop Reaction:** Normal - This tests the brain\u2019s ability to inhibit activity on command.\n    *   **Fast Rhythms:** Bi-frontal, non-reactive. This means fast brainwave activity is seen over the frontal lobes, but it doesn't change when stimulated (e.g., by flashing lights). This is non-specific but *can* indicate cortical irritability.\n    *   **Paroxysms:** Absent \u2013 This is good; it means no seizure-like activity was caught *during the recording*.\n    *   **Photostimulation & Hyperventilation:** Normal \u2013 No response to these common seizure-provoking techniques.\n    *   **Conclusion:**  \"Foyer de ralentissement localis\u00e9 fronto-temporal bilat\u00e9ral intermittent.\"  This is the most important part.   \u201cFoyer\u201d in this context means \u201cfocus\u201d or \u201carea\u201d. So, it's saying there's an *intermittent* (coming and going) area of *slowed* activity (the delta waves) located in both fronto-temporal regions.  \"Absence d'anomalies \u00e9pileptiformes franches\" means there are \u201cno clear epileptic abnormalities,\u201d implying that the slowing isn\u2019t a definitive, classic epileptiform spike.\n\n**What This Means:** The recent EEG isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. It shows subtle but potentially significant abnormalities suggestive of underlying brain irritability, especially in the fronto-temporal areas. This *could* be related to your seizures, particularly the focal onset (starting in a specific area of the brain) that myoclonic seizures can sometimes have.\n\n\n\n**In summary:** You've been through a lot. The medication mismanagement is a major issue that needs urgent attention. Aggressively advocate for yourself with your neurologist, bring up the mental health concerns, and push for a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses all aspects of your health.    Do not be afraid to seek a *second opinion* if you're not feeling heard.\n\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n*   **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/)\n\nI hope this detailed breakdown helps.

        "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly frightening and debilitating. You're right to want to understand what's going on and find ways to manage it. Given your detailed description, and the fact this has been happening since you were 11, with multiple episodes, it *absolutely* needs thorough medical investigation. It's good you've already had some testing, but the fact it often resolves before capture by tests is a key issue.  Let's break down possibilities, given your information, and then *crucially* what you need to do next.  I will preface this with a **very important disclaimer at the end**.\n\n**Possible Considerations (Not Diagnoses - just avenues for investigation):**\n\nBased on your description, here's a look at possibilities.  These are grouped by broad categories and ranked based on how well they fit your description, but *none* of this is a diagnosis.\n\n**1. Neurological Conditions (Highest Probability - Requires Expert Evaluation):**\n\n*   **Hemiplegic Migraine:** This is a rare type of migraine that can cause weakness and numbness on one side of the body, often mimicking stroke-like symptoms.  The headache and light/sound sensitivity you describe fit with migraine. Critically, some hemiplegic migraines *don't* have significant headache pain, or the headache can be less prominent. The loss of speech is also seen in some migraine variants. The temporary vision loss is also a significant clue.  *The exact, symmetrical 'half body' nature is unusual for standard migraine, which makes getting a specialized evaluation important.*\n*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) \u2013 \"Mini-Stroke\":**  Even though you're young, TIAs can happen. A blockage in a blood vessel in the brain, even briefly, can cause these symptoms.  This is less likely because of your age and repetitive nature, but *must* be considered and ruled out. The side-specific numbness is consistent.\n*   **Complex Migraine Aura:** Migraines can manifest differently in different individuals.  An aura can involve a very extensive range of neurological symptoms, including numbness, weakness, and speech difficulties.  Your experience could be a particularly complex and dramatic aura.\n*   **Neuromodulation syndromes:** There's a growing awareness of conditions where brain function can be disrupted in waves or cycles. These are very hard to diagnose, but can present with fluctuating neurological symptoms.\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):**  This is a condition where neurological symptoms (like numbness, weakness, speech problems) occur without detectable structural damage to the nervous system. It's often triggered by stress or underlying psychological factors, and it's *not* \"made up.\"  Given your diagnoses of ASD, GAD, and MMD, FND is a possibility, *but should only be considered after excluding other causes.* It is often a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n**2.  Less Likely but Still Possible - Requiring Investigation:**\n\n*   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** While less common at your age, MS can sometimes present with unusual sensory symptoms. The 'half body' presentation is not typical, but atypical presentations do occur.\n*   **Vascular Malformation:** A small abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain (AVM or dural arteriovenous fistula) *could* sometimes cause transient neurological symptoms, but these are often associated with more consistent symptoms, and the sudden onset and resolution are less common.\n*   **Autoimmune Conditions:** Some autoimmune disorders can affect the nervous system, leading to fluctuating neurological symptoms.\n*   **Seizure Activity:** While you don\u2019t describe convulsions, some seizures can present with subtle or unusual symptoms like numbness and speech difficulty. An EEG could help rule this out.\n\n\n\n**3.  The Role of Co-occurring Conditions (ASD, GAD, MMD):**\n\nYour diagnosed conditions are *very* relevant.  \n\n*   **Anxiety (GAD):** Severe anxiety *can* manifest with physical symptoms, including numbness and difficulty speaking. However, the consistent, strictly one-sided nature of your symptoms makes anxiety alone less likely to be the sole cause. It's far more likely to be a *contributing factor* \u2013 anxiety could be worsening or triggering the episodes.\n*   **Mood Disorders (MMD):**  Severe mood episodes can sometimes be associated with neurological symptoms.\n*   **Autism (ASD):** Sensory sensitivities are common in autism. While this doesn't directly explain the one-sided numbness, it might influence how you *experience* and *react* to the events.  The intensity of your emotional response (crying and wailing) could be related to sensory overload during the episode.\n\n\n\n\n**What You *Must* Do Next:**\n\n1.  **See a Neurologist \u2013 Specifically One with Expertise in Migraine & Neurological Disorders.** This is the top priority. Don't settle for a general practitioner. You need someone who specializes in brain function and disorders. Ask your primary care doctor for a referral to a neurologist who has experience with complex migraine, episodic neurological symptoms, and potentially functional neurological disorders.\n2.  **Detailed Episode Diary:** Start *immediately* keeping a very detailed diary of each episode. Include:\n    *   **Date and Time**\n    *   **What you were doing *immediately* before the episode started.** (This is crucial \u2013 even seemingly unimportant details)\n    *   **How the numbness began.** (Where did it start? How quickly did it spread?)\n    *   **Specific symptoms:** (What *exactly* was numb?  Vision changes? Speech problems? Headache characteristics \u2013 location, intensity, type of pain?). Note the specific, symmetrical nature of the numbness.\n    *   **Duration of each symptom.**\n    *   **Anything that seemed to trigger or worsen the episode.** (Stress?  Changes in weather?  Specific foods?  Sensory overload?)\n    *   **Anything that helped alleviate the episode.** (Breathing exercises \u2013 how much did they delay it?)\n3.  **Attempt to Document an Episode:** This is incredibly hard, but if possible, have someone with you during an episode.  A video recording of your symptoms (even just showing your facial droop or inability to speak) would be immensely helpful for diagnosis.\n4.  **Advocate for Yourself:**  You know your body best. Explain the patterns clearly and insist on a thorough investigation. Don't let doctors dismiss your symptoms.\n5. **Consider a Psychological Evaluation:** A skilled psychologist familiar with neurological conditions can assess the role of your existing diagnoses (ASD, GAD, MMD) and potentially help with coping strategies \u2013 *after* medical causes have been thoroughly investigated.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical diagnoses.

The information above is meant to provide you with questions to ask your doctor and potential areas to explore, not a self-diagnosis.  \n\n\n\n**To help me refine this information further (though still not a substitute for medical advice), can you tell me:**\n\n*   **Are the episodes increasing in frequency?**\n*   **Is there any family history of migraine, stroke, or neurological disorders?**\n*   **Have you experienced any recent head trauma, even minor?**\n* **Can you describe the specific type of breathing exercises you use and how much they delay the episode?**\n\n\n\n\nI truly hope you find answers and relief soon. This sounds incredibly challenging to live with, and you deserve a clear understanding of what's happening and a plan to manage it."

I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and it's good you're asking questions and being proactive. It's understandable to be worried, especially with conflicting information seeming to come up with your research. Let's break down your concerns based on what you've shared, and then I'll give you advice on what to do next. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is NOT a substitute for medical advice.**\n\n**Here's a summary of what's going on, as I understand it:**\n\n* **You have a history of involuntary movements:** Starting with shoulder jerks, progressing to full body movements, and now including head jerks.\n* **Initial concern: Myoclonic Epilepsy.** You sought a neurologist specifically for this possibility.\n* **EEG was normal.** This is *significant*. A normal EEG *decreases* the likelihood of typical myoclonic epilepsy, but doesn't *completely* rule it out.  Some types of epilepsy don't reliably show up on a routine EEG.\n* **Neurologist's Diagnosis:** The neurologist believes you have motor tics *and* ADHD.\n* **Medication:**\n    * **Tetrabenazine:** For tics.  This medication helps to suppress involuntary movements.\n    * **Clonidine:** For ADHD. It's an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used off-label for ADHD, and can also have some effect on impulsivity and tics.\n    * **Clonazepam (0.25mg):**  \"Emergency\" medication for when the jerks are severe. *You're right to notice this is also used for epilepsy.*\n* **Your Concern:** You're concerned that the doctor hasn't completely ruled out epilepsy, and you're wondering why Clonazepam was prescribed if that's the case.\n\n\n\n**Let's address your concerns directly:**\n\n**1. Why Clonazepam if epilepsy hasn\u2019t been ruled out?**\n\nYou are astute to question this. Clonazepam *is* an anti-epileptic drug.  Here's a possible rationale (and you should *ask your doctor to confirm* which of these applies):\n\n*   **Symptomatic Relief, Not Definitive Treatment:**  Clonazepam can provide *symptomatic relief* for *various* kinds of involuntary movements, even if the underlying cause isn\u2019t firmly established as epilepsy. It can calm overactive neurons.  The doctor might be using it to control the jerks *while* continuing to investigate the cause.\n*   **Overlap of Symptoms:**  Some types of seizures *can* manifest as movements that can *mimic* tics. The doctor might be covering their bases, knowing that even with a normal EEG, some forms of epilepsy are harder to diagnose.\n*   **Potential for Misdiagnosis:** Sometimes, the presentation of tics and certain types of epilepsy can be very similar, even to experienced neurologists.\n*  **Bridge to Diagnosis:** While investigating, Clonazepam might be used to manage symptoms while further testing is considered.\n\n**2. Should you be worried the situation hasn't been properly diagnosed?**\n\nIt is absolutely reasonable to have some worry. The progression of your symptoms (shoulder jerks to full-body, now to head jerks) suggests something is evolving, and a definitive answer is important.  However, the fact the neurologist has started *some* treatment shows they aren\u2019t dismissing your symptoms.\n\n**3.  ADHD and Tics:** Your doctor\u2019s diagnosis attempts to explain the movement. ADHD can sometimes present with motor restlessness, and tics and ADHD frequently co-occur.  However, only a full diagnosis by a professional can confirm this.\n\n\n\n**What you should do *immediately*:**\n\n1.  **Schedule a Follow-Up Appointment:**  The most important thing is to book a follow-up appointment with the neurologist *as soon as possible*.  Don't wait for your next scheduled appointment \u2013 call and explain your concerns.\n2.  **Prepare a List of Questions:**  Write down a detailed list of questions *before* your appointment.  Here are some suggestions:\n    *   \"Can you explain why you prescribed Clonazepam, given that you haven't definitively ruled out epilepsy?\"\n    *   \"What specific type of motor tics do you believe I have?\"\n    *   \"What other tests, if any, are you considering to rule out other causes of my movements?\" (Specifically ask about Video EEG, Ambulatory EEG, or MRI)\n    *   \"What is the plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the Tetrabenazine and Clonidine?\"\n    *   \"What are the potential side effects of these medications, and what should I do if I experience them?\"\n    *   \"What is the long-term management plan?\"\n3.  **Keep a Symptom Diary:**  Start a diary documenting your jerks.  Note:\n    *   Time of day\n    *   What you were doing before the jerk\n    *   How long the jerk lasted.\n    *   What part of the body was affected.\n    *   Any potential triggers (stress, fatigue, caffeine, etc.)\n    *   Whether you took Clonazepam and if it helped.  This will be invaluable for your doctor.\n4. **Be honest and thorough:** When speaking with your doctor, be clear about your concerns and describe your symptoms as accurately as possible. Don't minimize or downplay anything.\n\n\n\n\n**Possible Further Investigation (Things to ask about):**\n\n*   **Longer EEG:** A standard EEG is relatively short. A longer EEG (24-48 hours, or even up to a week) or ambulatory EEG (wearing a portable EEG device while doing your normal activities) can increase the chances of capturing any seizure activity.\n* **Video EEG:** This records your EEG and video simultaneously, allowing doctors to correlate brain activity with your movements. It\u2019s very helpful in distinguishing between tics and seizures.\n*   **MRI of the Brain:** An MRI can rule out structural abnormalities in the brain that might be causing the movements.\n*   **Neurological Examination:** A very thorough neurological exam to assess reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

Your doctor is the best person to assess your specific situation, interpret your test results, and recommend the most appropriate course of action. Do not change or stop any medication without talking to your doctor first.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.  I understand this is anxiety-provoking, but actively engaging with your healthcare provider and asking the right questions will empower you to get the best possible care.

        "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds really frustrating, especially given your profession! Air hunger with stimulant medication is a recognized side effect, but it's particularly tough for someone who needs precise breath control like a classical singer. Here's a breakdown of potential causes, things to try, and what you should discuss with your doctor.  I'll also address the interplay with your current medications. **Please read the disclaimer at the end as this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Air Hunger**\n\n* **Physiological Effects of Stimulants:** Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) increases dopamine and norepinephrine.  This can cause constriction of blood vessels, including those in the lungs, potentially leading to a sensation of not getting enough air. It can also speed up your respiratory rate without you consciously realizing it, leading to shallower breathing.\n* **Anxiety Component:**  ADHD and anxiety often co-occur. Even if the Vyvanse isn\u2019t directly *causing* anxiety, the changes in brain chemistry can sometimes heighten underlying anxious feelings.  Anxiety is *very* good at creating the sensation of air hunger.\n* **Your Existing Medications:**  This is important.  Zoloft (sertraline) is an SSRI.  While not a direct interaction often cited, SSRIs *can* sometimes worsen respiratory symptoms in some people.  Lamictal (lamotrigine) is less likely to be a contributor, but any change in neurochemistry can affect breathing patterns.\n* **Individual Sensitivity:** People react differently to medications. Some are just more sensitive to the respiratory effects of stimulants.\n* **Diaphragmatic Breathing & Habit:** You *know* how to breathe correctly \u2013 that's great! But sometimes, when stressed or focused, we revert to shallow chest breathing without realizing it.  The Vyvanse might be exacerbating this tendency.\n\n\n\n**Things You Can Try *Now* (While awaiting doctor's guidance)**\n\n* **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** Stimulants can be dehydrating.  Dehydration can worsen the sensation of breathlessness.  Aim for consistent water intake throughout the day.\n* **Paced Breathing Exercises:**  Even though you *know* you're breathing, your brain might not be registering it properly.  Try these:\n    * **Box Breathing:** Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts. Repeat.\n    * **Diaphragmatic Breathing (belly breathing):**  Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.  Focus on breathing deeply *into* your belly, so your stomach rises while your chest stays relatively still. Slow down your breathing.\n* **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Anything that reduces overall anxiety levels can help.  Meditation apps (Headspace, Calm), progressive muscle relaxation, or even just quiet time listening to calming music.\n* **Gentle Movement:** Not strenuous exercise.  Light walking, stretching can sometimes help increase oxygenation and awareness of your breathing.\n* **Check Your Posture:** Slouching can restrict lung capacity.  Be mindful of sitting and standing with good posture.\n* **Reduce Caffeine/Other Stimulants:**  Additives can worsen the effect.\n* **Monitor and Journal:** Keep a detailed journal of the air hunger.  Note:\n    * Time of day it\u2019s worst\n    * Activities you\u2019re doing when it\u2019s worst (singing practice?  Studying?  Talking?)\n    * Your anxiety level at the time\n    * Anything else that seems to correlate (food, stress, etc.).\n\n\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Psychiatrist \u2013 *This is Critical***\n\n* **Severity and Impact:**  Clearly explain how much this is affecting your life, *especially* your singing.  \"It's just uncomfortable\" is different than \"It is impacting my ability to practice and perform.\"\n* **Timing:**  You\u2019ve already started this, but emphasize that it started with the Vyvanse.  Be precise about how much worse it is compared to the Concerta.\n* **Differential Diagnosis Review:**  Briefly re-discuss *why* you are pursuing ADHD diagnosis. Rule out or address possible contribution from another issue\n* **Possible Solutions:**  Ask about these:\n    * **Dose Adjustment:** This is the most likely first step.  Perhaps a *very* low starting dose of Vyvanse and a *very* slow titration.\n    * **Alternative Medications:**  Are there other non-stimulant options that might be worth exploring, given this side effect? (Guanfacine, atomoxetine, etc.).\n    * **Combination Therapy:**  Could a lower dose of stimulant combined with something else be effective?\n    * **Beta-Blocker (Cautiously):**  *Only* discuss this with your doctor \u2013 a low-dose beta-blocker (like propranolol) can sometimes help with physical symptoms of anxiety, including breathlessness, but it has its own side effects and interactions.  *Do not try this without a prescription and careful medical supervision.* Seriously, don\u2019t.\n    * **Rule out Physical Causes:** Your doctor may want to check basic lung function to rule out anything else (though this is less likely given your history as a singer).\n* **Medication Interactions:**  Specifically ask about potential interactions between Vyvanse, Zoloft, and Lamictal, focusing on respiratory effects.\n\n\n\n**Regarding the IUD:**\n\nWhile your IUD isn't a *direct* cause, hormonal IUDs can sometimes affect mood and anxiety levels, which, as discussed, can exacerbate breathlessness.  It\u2019s worth mentioning to your doctor as part of your full picture.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It's good you're proactively seeking information and being mindful of your body.  It\u2019s also commendable that you\u2019re aware of your breathing technique from your singing background \u2013 that\u2019s a great starting point.  Good luck!

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, it's *very* good you booked a neurologist appointment. You're doing the right thing. It's also understandable to feel anxious when these things start happening again after a period of calm. It sounds incredibly unsettling, and your description strongly suggests a focal (partial) seizure, despite the previous ER visit finding nothing. Let's break down guidance, what to expect, and things you can do:\n\n**1. What You Experienced: Sounds Like a Focal Seizure (with possible Aura)**\n\nYour symptoms are *very* consistent with a focal seizure, specifically likely originating in the occipital lobe (back of the brain, dealing with vision) or potentially temporal lobe (often associated with deja vu and memory feelings, and sometimes visual disturbances). Here's how your symptoms align:\n\n*   **Aura (Static/Colors):** This is a common type of aura.  Visual auras are frequent in focal seizures originating in the visual cortex. The static and then colors fit.\n*   **Nausea:**  Often accompanies seizures.\n*   **Cold Limbs:**  Can happen due to changes in autonomic nervous system function during a seizure.\n*   **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu & Unusual Thoughts:** Strongly suggests temporal lobe involvement.  Seizures in this area can trigger a feeling of familiarity, even to very old memories or feelings.\n*   **Peripheral Vision Loss:** Strongly points to visual cortex involvement.\n*   **Difficulty Speaking:**  Can occur when the seizure affects areas of the brain controlling language.\n*   **Near Loss of Consciousness:**  Focal seizures can sometimes progress (or *can* remain as just focal activity), but the *feeling* of losing consciousness is significant. The history of full loss of consciousness in 2020 is especially important to tell the neurologist.\n*   **Eye Movements & Facial Droop (Past Episode):** This is crucial. Those symptoms are more indicative of a complex focal seizure that was evolving.  Drooping often indicates weakness, which can occur during a seizure.\n\n**2. Why the ER Didn't Find Anything (Previously)**\n\nThis is common.  Here's why:\n\n*   **Timing:**  Seizures are intermittent.  If you weren't actively seizing when you were at the ER (or it had already stopped), standard tests like an initial CT scan might not show anything.  Brain scans are often normal *between* seizures.\n*   **Type of Seizure:** Focal seizures don't always have dramatic, obvious physical manifestations on routine scans.\n*   **Limited Monitoring:** ERs are focused on immediate, life-threatening conditions.  They aren\u2019t equipped for prolonged seizure monitoring.\n*   **Normal EEG:**  An EEG might have been done, but can be normal even if you have seizures.  It depends on where the seizure originates and how often it happens.\n\n**3. What to Expect at the Neurologist**\n\nYour neurologist will likely do the following:\n\n*   **Detailed History:** Be *extremely* specific.  Write down everything you've told me here, plus:\n    *   **Frequency:** How often have these episodes happened in the past week?  How often did they happen in 2020?\n    *   **Triggers:**  Can you identify anything that seems to bring them on (stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, specific foods, etc.)?\n    *   **Post-Ictal State:** How do you feel *after* the event? (Confused, tired, headache, etc.)  How long does this state last?\n    *   **Medications:** List all medications you take, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n    *   **Family History:**  Any family history of seizures, epilepsy, or neurological conditions?\n*   **Neurological Exam:**  They will assess your reflexes, strength, coordination, vision, and mental status.\n*   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  This is the *most* important test.  It measures electrical activity in your brain.  A standard EEG is often done, but if that's normal, they may recommend:\n    *   **Prolonged EEG Monitoring:**  Wearing an EEG for 24-72 hours (or even longer) to try to capture a seizure event.\n    *   **Video EEG:** The gold standard. EEG is recorded *with* video monitoring to correlate the brain activity with your observable symptoms.\n*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  A more detailed brain scan than a CT scan.  It can sometimes reveal structural abnormalities that might be causing the seizures.\n*   **Blood Tests:** To rule out other potential causes (electrolyte imbalances, infections, etc.).\n\n**4. What You Can Do *Now* (Before Your Appointment)**\n\n*   **Keep a Seizure Diary:**  This is incredibly helpful for the neurologist.  Record:\n    *   Date and time of each event.\n    *   What you were doing beforehand.\n    *   The exact symptoms you experienced (be as detailed as possible).\n    *   How long the event lasted.\n    *   How you felt afterward.\n*   **Try to Identify Triggers:**  Pay attention to anything that might precede the episodes.\n*   **Avoid Potential Triggers:** If you suspect something (e.g., stress, lack of sleep), try to minimize it if possible.\n*   **Safety Precautions:**  Because you\u2019ve had some loss of awareness, be cautious about activities that could be dangerous (driving, swimming, operating machinery) until you have a diagnosis and treatment plan. *This is really important.*\n*  **Ask someone to accompany you to your appointment:** It's good to have a support person and someone who can help you remember details.\n\n**5. Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Don't Self-Diagnose:**  While your description is highly suggestive of a focal seizure, only a neurologist can make an accurate diagnosis.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Advocate for Yourself:** If you feel like your concerns aren\u2019t being taken seriously, speak up! You know your body best.\n*   **Treatment is Often Available:**  Epilepsy (a condition of recurrent seizures) is often well-managed with medication.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\n**To help me give you even more tailored guidance, could you tell me:**\n\n*   When is your neurologist appointment?\n*   How many times did this happen in the last week?\n*   Are you currently taking any medications?\n*   Do you have any known medical conditions?\n\n\n\nI hope this is helpful.  You're taking the right steps, and I'm glad you're seeking medical attention.  It\u2019s scary when these things happen, but getting a diagnosis and a plan will help you feel more in control."

        "question": "I\u2019m male, age 19, BMI currently 18.5, location: USA, my issues began at age 12 right after puberty, however, I would get moments of AIWS and vomiting in the middle of the night prior around age 7, I eat fine and have no family history of stroke or blood clot disorders, I have a healthy BMI, and my blood and heart have been tested at 12 and were fine. I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex presentation, and you're right to be seeking understanding. It sounds incredibly distressing to experience these recurring episodes, and the fact that they've continued, though milder, for seven years is significant.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, outlining potential areas to explore with medical professionals, based on the information you've provided.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end - this is *not* a diagnosis, but a list of things to discuss with a doctor.**\n\n**Key Observations & Possible Areas to Investigate:**\n\n* **Timing Related to Puberty:** The onset right after puberty is a *very* important clue. Hormonal shifts can trigger or exacerbate certain conditions.\n* **AIWS (Autonomic Instability with Withdrawal Symptoms) & Panic:** The strong link between AIWS-like symptoms and panic attacks is central.  This points strongly towards a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. This could be primary (something fundamentally wrong with the autonomic system) or secondary (caused by something else).\n* **Gastrointestinal Connection:** The consistent improvement *after* bowel movements is a very strong indicator. This suggests a gut-brain axis involvement. This is not just a coincidence.\n* **Neurological Symptoms:**  Difficulty understanding speech, blurry vision, ptosis, numbness, and the foggy hearing are neurological symptoms, even if they seem transient.\n* **Psychological Component:**  Your intuition about potential non-epileptic seizures (PNES) related to anxiety is astute.  PNES can manifest in very diverse ways and often accompany other conditions.\n* **Sensory Overload & Avoidance:**  The panic when someone looks or speaks to you, and the need to withdraw, is a clear sign of overwhelming sensory input.\n* **Subtle Residual Symptoms:** The lingering subtle numbness after a flare-up suggests some level of persistent nervous system irritation.\n* **Food Intolerance Link:** The pattern of symptoms triggered by food and related to bowel movements points strongly toward a link between food intolerance and the symptoms.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of potential areas for your doctor to investigate.  I'm organizing this based on systems involved:**\n\n**1. Neurological Evaluation (despite previous testing):**\n\n* **Repeat Neurological Exam:**  Even if previous tests were normal, a new exam is necessary, focusing on cranial nerve function (to assess vision, facial sensation, etc.), reflexes, and coordination. Pay attention to the ptosis and any subtle weaknesses.\n* **Consider EEG (Electroencephalogram):** While you suspect PNES, an EEG can help definitively rule out or identify epileptic activity.  Even if normal, it doesn\u2019t rule out PNES. You might need a prolonged or sleep-deprived EEG.\n* **MRI of the Brain:**  A more detailed imaging scan to look for any structural abnormalities that might be contributing.  This is especially important given the neurological symptoms.\n* **Consider a referral to a Neurologist with expertise in Autonomic Dysfunction:**  This is critical. A general neurologist may not be equipped to deal with the complexities of autonomic issues.\n\n**2. Autonomic Nervous System Evaluation:**\n\n* **Tilt Table Test:** To assess for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) or other forms of orthostatic intolerance.  This tests how your heart rate and blood pressure respond to changes in position.\n* **Sweat Testing (Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test - QSART):**  Evaluates small nerve fibre function, which is often affected in autonomic disorders.\n* **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Testing:**  Measures the variation in time between heartbeats, which can be an indicator of autonomic balance.\n* **Blood Pressure Monitoring (24-hour ambulatory):**  To identify fluctuations in blood pressure.\n\n**3. Gastrointestinal Evaluation:**\n\n* **Detailed Food Diary & Elimination Diet:** Carefully tracking *everything* you eat and correlating it with your symptoms.  Then, with medical guidance, systematically eliminating potential trigger foods.\n* **Comprehensive Stool Testing:**  To look for inflammation, dysbiosis (imbalance of gut bacteria), and potential pathogens.\n* **SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) Testing:**  SIBO can cause a wide range of symptoms, including neurological and psychological ones.\n* **Visceral Sensitivity Testing:** (less common, but potentially helpful)  This assesses how sensitive your gut is to distension.\n* **Consider testing for food sensitivities/intolerances:** IgE and IgG based tests are controversial, so discuss with your doctor.\n\n**4. Psychological Evaluation:**\n\n* **Assessment for Anxiety Disorders:**  A thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist specializing in anxiety and trauma.  \n* **Biofeedback/Neurofeedback:**  Therapies that can help you learn to regulate your autonomic nervous system.\n* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Can be helpful in managing anxiety and panic attacks, and in coping with the challenges of a chronic condition.  Specifically, CBT for panic disorder and/or health anxiety.\n* **Exploration of Trauma History:**  Sometimes, underlying trauma can manifest as autonomic dysfunction and PNES.\n\n**5. Hormonal Evaluation:**\n\n* **Comprehensive Hormone Panel:**  Given the onset after puberty, check thyroid hormones, cortisol (to assess adrenal function), and sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen).\n\n\n\n**Putting it all together and potential working theories:**\n\n* **Autonomic Dysfunction (likely primary):** The pattern of symptoms strongly suggests an underlying problem with the autonomic nervous system.  POTS, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, or other forms of autonomic dysregulation should be considered.\n* **Gut-Brain Axis Dysregulation:** The clear link to food intolerances and bowel movements suggests a strong connection between your gut and your brain.  Inflammation in the gut could be triggering neurological and psychological symptoms.\n* **PNES as a Response:** The PNES may be a manifestation of the anxiety and panic triggered by the unpredictable nature of the autonomic and gut-related symptoms.  It's a way your body is *reacting* to the stress.\n* **Vascular Component (less likely, but needs consideration):** While your previous heart tests were normal, the transient neurological symptoms (blurred vision, speech difficulty) *could* suggest brief episodes of reduced cerebral blood flow. This is less likely, but should be kept in mind.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Schedule a comprehensive appointment with your Primary Care Physician.** Bring a detailed symptom diary, including what you eat, when symptoms occur, and what makes them better or worse.\n2. **Request referrals** to the specialists mentioned above: Neurologist (with autonomic expertise), Gastroenterologist, and Psychiatrist/Psychologist.\n3. **Be persistent.**  It may take time to get a diagnosis and find the right treatment plan.\n4. **Advocate for yourself.**  Don't be afraid to ask questions and express your concerns.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, let's break down your situation with Keppra, the fogginess, and timing/food considerations.  I'm glad you're being proactive about this \u2013 it's great you're noticing and questioning how the medication impacts you.  **However, please read the *very important disclaimer* at the end of this response.**\n\n**Understanding Keppra & Common Side Effects**\n\nKeppra (levetiracetam) is a common and generally well-tolerated anti-epileptic drug (AED). However, it *does* have a range of potential side effects, and you're experiencing some common ones. 'Fogginess,' feeling 'drunk,' or having cognitive slowing are frequently reported, even at therapeutic doses. These can manifest as:\n\n*   **Difficulty Concentrating:** Trouble focusing on tasks.\n*   **Memory Issues:**  Minor short-term memory lapses.\n*   **Slowed Thinking:**  Feeling like your thoughts aren't as quick as usual.\n*   **Drowsiness/Sedation:**  Even if not overtly sleepy, it can contribute to the foggy feeling.\n*   **Mood Changes:**  Irritability, anxiety, or even depression can occur in some individuals.  (Less likely to present as \"fog\" directly, but can contribute to feeling \"off\").\n\n**Is This Normal?**\n\nYes, to a degree, the fogginess *can* be normal, *especially* when first starting or adjusting the dose of Keppra.  Your brain is adjusting to having this medication altering its electrical activity. However, the fact that it's persisting several months after starting, and even with a dose reduction, suggests it needs further investigation, and optimization.  The goal is to find the *lowest effective dose* that controls your seizures with the *least* side effects.\n\n**Timing and Food \u2013 What to Try (and Discuss with Your Doctor!)**\n\nYou're right to consider timing and food, as these can make a difference. Here's a breakdown of possibilities.  **Do not make any changes to your medication schedule *without first discussing it with your neurologist*.** I'm providing ideas to discuss with them.\n\n*   **With Food vs. Without:**  Keppra *can* be taken with or without food. However, some people find taking it *with* a meal reduces the intensity of side effects, potentially by slowing absorption.  It\u2019s a good thing to try.\n*   **Time of Day \u2013 Experimentation, Guided by Your Doctor:** This is where things get more individualized:\n    *   **Morning:**  If the fogginess is debilitating, *avoid* taking it right before activities requiring high focus (work, driving, anything demanding). You might find morning dosing gives you the most consistent control but impacts your daytime alertness.\n    *   **Evening/Before Bed:** This is a common approach. The sedative effects might be less noticeable when you're going to sleep, and it could help if the fogginess tends to worsen throughout the day. *However*, it *could* also lead to more daytime carryover effects if your body doesn't metabolize it quickly enough.  (This is why individual response is key.)\n    *   **Splitting the Dose (Discuss with Neuro):**  Even though you're currently on once-daily, it's worth asking your doctor if *re-splitting* the dose into two smaller doses (e.g., 500mg twice a day) might lead to more stable blood levels and fewer peaks and valleys of side effects.  This depends on your seizure type and control.\n* **Motrin Interaction:** While Motrin (ibuprofen) isn't a *major* known interaction with Keppra, consistent use of NSAIDs (like Motrin) can sometimes affect kidney function, and Keppra is processed through the kidneys.  It's good your doctor is aware of your Motrin use, and it's something to keep in mind.\n\n**What You Should *Definitely* Do:  Talk to Your Neurologist**\n\nThis is the most important point.  Here\u2019s what you should discuss with your neurologist at your next appointment (or call sooner if symptoms are very bothersome):\n\n1.  **Detailed Symptom Diary:** Keep a log for a week or two *before* your appointment.  Note:\n    *   **Time of day you take Keppra.**\n    *   **What you eat/drink with it (if anything).**\n    *   **The severity of your fogginess throughout the day (rate it 1-10).**\n    *   **Specific times you notice it's worst.**\n    *   **Any activities significantly impacted.**\n2.  **Reiterate Your Concerns:** Don't downplay the fogginess. Explain how it affects your daily life.  \"I'm having difficulty concentrating at work,\" or \"I feel unsafe driving at times.\"\n3.  **Discuss Timing Adjustments:**  Bring up the ideas of trying different times of day and potential dose splitting (as mentioned above).\n4.  **Explore Alternative Medications:** If Keppra's side effects are consistently bothersome and significantly impacting your quality of life *despite* timing adjustments, ask about other AED options. There are many, and people respond very differently to them.\n5.  **Rule Out Other Causes:** While Keppra is the likely culprit, your doctor might want to rule out other potential causes of cognitive changes (e.g., vitamin deficiencies, sleep apnea, thyroid issues).\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  *Always* follow your doctor's instructions regarding medication and never change your dosage or timing without their approval.  This is particularly crucial with epilepsy medication, as abrupt changes can potentially trigger seizures. I am not a substitute for professional medical care.\n\n\n\n"

Duration of complaint - 3 years    Location - Soft palate    Any existing relevant medical issues - Subjective Tinnitus caused by olanzapine and an MRI scan   Current medications - Cinolazepam for sleep, Mysoline for the myoclonus. Is palatal myoclonus treatable?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, let's break down your situation and address the question of palatal myoclonus treatment. This is a complex issue, and I'll give you a thorough answer, but **please remember I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  This information is for general knowledge and discussion only. You *must* discuss this with your doctor.**\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n* **Palatal Myoclonus:**  You're experiencing involuntary rhythmic movements of the soft palate (the back part of the roof of your mouth). This can sometimes be noticeable as a clicking sound in the ear (which can exacerbate your existing tinnitus), a feeling of something moving, or just a subtle fluttering sensation.  The fact it's been going on for 3 years is significant.\n* **Age & Weight:** At 30 and 60kg (about 132 lbs) for 5'8\", your BMI is in the underweight range (around 19.8). Although not directly related to the myoclonus *cause*, nutritional status is often assessed in cases of neurological symptoms.\n* **Olanzapine & Tinnitus:** This is important. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication known to sometimes cause tinnitus as a side effect.  The fact that it *caused* tinnitus suggests your auditory system is potentially sensitive.\n* **MRI Scan:**  The MRI likely was to investigate the cause of the myoclonus.  It's good information that it didn't reveal anything obvious, but doesn't rule out all causes (see \"Causes\" below).\n* **Current Medications:**\n    * **Cinolazepam:** A benzodiazepine, typically used for short-term insomnia. Its use suggests there are sleep disturbances, which can sometimes be related to the myoclonus or just present with it.\n    * **Mysoline (Primidone):** An anti-seizure medication. *This is a significant clue*. Primidone is *also* used to treat palatal myoclonus!  The fact you are already *on* this suggests your doctor suspects (or confirmed) a diagnosis of palatal myoclonus.\n\n\n\n**Is Palatal Myoclonus Treatable?  The Answer is... Complex.**\n\nYes, palatal myoclonus *can* be treated, but with varying degrees of success, and the approach depends heavily on the underlying cause.  Here's a detailed look:\n\n**1. Identifying the Cause (Crucial!)**\n\nThe first step is determining *why* the palatal myoclonus is happening.  The causes are diverse:\n\n* **Essential Palatal Myoclonus (Primary):** This means there's no identifiable underlying neurological condition.  It's a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., everything else has been ruled out). This type can be more difficult to treat.\n* **Secondary Palatal Myoclonus:** This is caused by a definable problem:\n    * **Brainstem Lesions:**  Rare, but possible. Stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), tumors, or other damage in the brainstem can disrupt nerve pathways.  The MRI *should* have detected most of these, but small lesions can sometimes be missed.\n    * **Cerebellar Involvement:** Issues in the cerebellum (coordination center of the brain).\n    * **Reflex Myoclonus:** Triggered by sensory input.\n    * **Medication-Induced:** While your olanzapine is a past issue, other medications can contribute.\n    * **Infections:**  Certain infections have been linked.\n    * **Autoimmune Conditions:** Rarely, autoimmune diseases can be a factor.\n    * **Vascular Malformations:** Abnormal blood vessels in the brain.\n\n\n\n\n**2.  Treatment Options (Given Your Medications)**\n\nSince you're already on Mysoline (Primidone), your doctor is likely trying to address the myoclonus medically.\n\n* **Primidone (Mysoline):** This is a first-line treatment for palatal myoclonus, particularly for essential palatal myoclonus. It works by reducing the excitability of neurons.  *The fact that you are on it means your doctor thinks it's a reasonable approach.*  Often, it needs to be titrated (dose adjusted) slowly to find the optimal dose. **Important:** Primidone has side effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea) and interacts with other medications.\n* **Other Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):** If primidone isn't fully effective, other AEDs might be tried, like:\n    *  Topiramate\n    *  Levetiracetam\n    *  Gabapentin\n* **Botulinum Toxin (Botox) Injections:** Injections into the soft palate muscles can temporarily paralyze them, stopping the movement. This provides significant relief, but the effect wears off (typically 3-4 months), requiring repeat injections.  This is often used when medications aren't enough.\n* **Surgery:**  Very rarely considered, and usually only for severe cases unresponsive to other treatments. A palatoplasty (surgical repair of the soft palate) can be considered to weaken the muscles, but it's not always successful and carries risks.\n* **Treating Underlying Cause:** If a secondary cause is identified (like MS), the treatment will focus on managing that condition.  Addressing the root problem might reduce or eliminate the myoclonus.\n* **Addressing Sleep and Anxiety:** As you're taking Cinolazepam, ensuring good sleep hygiene and managing any associated anxiety is important.  Sometimes, calming techniques or therapy can help.\n\n**Regarding Your Specific Concerns and Questions:**\n\n* **Duration (3 Years):** Long-lasting myoclonus, even if not debilitating, warrants continued investigation and optimized treatment.\n* **Location (Soft Palate):** This is a relatively specific location, making diagnosis somewhat more straightforward.\n* **Tinnitus:** The myoclonus could be *perceived* as, or exacerbate, your tinnitus.  Managing the myoclonus may help reduce the auditory disturbance.\n* **MRI Scan Already Done:** Useful, but a negative MRI doesn\u2019t exclude everything.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do Now (Most Important)**\n\n1. **Follow Up with Your Doctor:** This is paramount.  Discuss the following with them:\n    *  *How well is the Mysoline working?*  Are you experiencing any side effects?\n    *  *Have they considered further investigations?*  Even with a negative MRI, are there other tests that could be helpful?\n    *  *What is their likely diagnosis (essential vs. secondary)?* Understanding their thinking is crucial.\n    * *Discuss your nutritional status.* Being underweight could be a factor in overall health, which might influence neurological symptoms.\n2. **Keep a Myoclonus Diary:**  Note when the myoclonus is more prominent, what makes it worse, and what (if anything) seems to help. This is valuable information for your doctor.\n3. **Be Patient:**  Finding the right treatment can take time and experimentation.\n4. **Second Opinion (Consider):** If you're not satisfied with the progress, or if you feel your concerns aren\u2019t being adequately addressed, consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist specializing in movement disorders.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* complex case with a lot of interconnected symptoms and a significant medical history. You're right to try and gather as much information as possible. It's good you have access to your imaging and are proactive. Given the breadth of your issues, seeking expert consultation *is* wise, but understandable wanting to avoid potential COVID exposure. I can certainly offer some input based on what you've shared, and then discuss how to approach interpreting your MRI.  However, **I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This information is for discussion and informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**\n\n**Let's break down the information and explore potential connections.  I\u2019ll then suggest what to look for in the MRI, and how you might discuss it with your doctor.**\n\n**Key Issues & Potential Connections:**\n\n* **CVST & Factor V Leiden:** The cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a central piece. Factor V Leiden increases your risk of blood clots.  The fact that it involved several sinuses is significant - more extensive thrombosis usually means more potential for long-term sequelae.\n* **Epilepsy (Right Temporal Lobe):**  The epilepsy is almost certainly *related* to the CVST, even though time has passed.  CVST can cause scarring and damage to brain tissue, increasing the risk of seizures, particularly in the area affected by the clot.  Right temporal lobe epilepsy explains the deja vu, zoning out, and potentially the speech difficulties (stuttering).\n* **Peripheral Vision Loss:** This is concerning.  While it *could* be separate, in the context of the CVST and epilepsy, it raises the possibility of ongoing vascular or neurological impact on the visual pathways.  It needs serious evaluation.\n* **Temperature Dysregulation:** This is a fascinating and potentially significant symptom.  It could be hypothalamic involvement; the hypothalamus is critical for temperature control and is also connected to regions often affected by seizures.  CVST can *sometimes* affect the hypothalamus directly, or indirectly through inflammation/vascular changes. Blood clot in the venous drainage can sometimes lead to inflammation of adjacent structures. Could also possibly be autonomic dysfunction (see below).\n* **Sleep Disturbances (Sleep Paralysis, Hallucinations, Exploding Head Syndrome, Insomnia):** These are *very* common in epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy.  They can be a direct result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The fear of these events is understandably worsening your insomnia. Also overlaps with dysautonomia.\n* **Autonomic Dysfunction:**  Taken together, temperature regulation issues, sleep disturbances, anxiety, HR issues on propranolol and potential blood pressure issues could point to autonomic dysfunction. CVST can sometimes disrupt the autonomic nervous system.\n* **Weight Gain:** Could be multifactorial \u2013 medication side effect (some anti-epileptics can lead to weight gain), hormonal changes secondary to stress, reduced activity (fear of seizures), or metabolic effects of chronic illness.\n* **Past Migraines:** The reduction in migraines since starting Eliquis is interesting.  Could be because you're now protected from further clotting, or that another factor has changed.\n\n**What to Look For on the MRI (and how to discuss with your doctor/neurologist):**\n\nNow, focusing on the 2021 MRI. This is where getting specific is key. I need more information about *what* the MRI was looking at. Was it specifically to evaluate the sinuses? Brain parenchyma (tissue)? Or was it more comprehensive?\n\nHere's what to discuss and point out with the radiologist and/or neurologist:\n\n1. **Recanalization of the Sinuses:**  This is the *most* important question. Have the affected sinuses (superior sagittal, transverse, sigmoid, jugular) reopened?  Is there still any evidence of chronic thrombosis (scarring, narrowing)?  Look for flow voids (dark areas indicating blood flow) within the sinuses.  If there's significant stenosis (narrowing) despite being on Eliquis, it\u2019s a major concern.\n2. **Brain Parenchyma Changes:**\n    * **Gliosis/Scarring:**  Are there areas of abnormal signal intensity (brightness/darkness) in the brain tissue near the previously affected sinuses? This could indicate gliosis (scar tissue formation) from the CVST.  This is common post-CVST and can contribute to seizures.\n    * **Enlarged Ventricles:** CVST can cause subtle changes in brain volume, sometimes leading to enlarged ventricles (fluid-filled spaces).\n    * **Hippocampal Sclerosis:**  Since your epilepsy is temporal lobe based, specifically look at the hippocampus on that side.  Damage to the hippocampus (sclerosis) is a common finding in temporal lobe epilepsy.\n    * **Subdural Collections:**  Sometimes after a CVST, there can be small fluid collections under the dura (the outer covering of the brain).\n3. **Vascularity:**  Any other abnormalities of blood vessels?\n4. **Evidence of Inflammation:** Look for signs of ongoing inflammation (often seen on certain MRI sequences).\n5. **Compare with 2019 MRI:**  *Crucially*, the radiologist should compare the 2021 MRI to the 2019 MRI to assess for changes.  Have things improved, worsened, or stayed stable?\n\n\n\n**Regarding COVID & Seeking Expertise:**\n\nYou're right to be cautious about traveling for a second opinion right now.  Here's what I'd suggest:\n\n* **Telemedicine:** See if Cornell or similar institutions offer thorough telemedicine consultations.  You can send them your imaging for review.\n* **Second Opinion at a Local Center:** Is there a major medical center *closer* to you with a strong neurology department and neuro-radiology expertise?\n* **Image Sharing:** Ask your neurologist if they can proactively share your imaging with a specialist at Cornell (with your permission, of course).\n\n**Regarding your Medications:**\n\n* **Eliquis:** Essential to prevent further clots.\n* **Keppra:** A common anti-epileptic.\n* **Propranolol:** Used for migraine prevention, anxiety, and sometimes to reduce tremor.\n* **Discuss with your doctor:** make sure there are no interactions with any of your medications.\n\n**To help me provide more tailored input (if you\u2019re willing):**\n\n1. **Can you describe the MRI sequences that were performed in 2021?**  (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging, MRV/MRA). This is listed in the report.\n2. **Are you able to share a *de-identified* image from the 2021 MRI?** (I understand privacy concerns. You can blur out any identifying information). Even a single axial slice showing the sagittal sinus could be helpful.  I can\u2019t *diagnose*, but I can point out anatomical landmarks and potential areas of concern.\n3. **Can you provide a brief summary of the 2019 MRI report findings?** (Specifically regarding the CVST and any surrounding brain tissue changes).\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou're facing a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed.  Advocate for yourself, ask questions, and don't hesitate to seek second opinions. You're doing the right things by being informed and proactive.  Your complexity requires a very experienced team to help you sort through these issues.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really valid concern, and it's good you're addressing it now so you can start to move forward. You\u2019ve been through a *lot* medically in a short period, and the anxiety around potential long-term effects from the imaging is completely understandable. Let's break down your situation, assess the radiation dose, compare it to other exposures, and hopefully offer some reassurance. I'll try to be thorough, but please remember I am an AI and this is *not* medical advice. You should absolutely discuss this with your doctor, ideally one familiar with radiation oncology or medical physics, for truly personalized assessment.\n\n**Understanding Your Radiation Dose**\n\nThe key metric you've provided is DLP (Dose Length Product), which is a measure of radiation dose from CT scans. It's a good starting point, but it's not the whole story.  It depends on many factors, including your size/weight, the specific scanner used, and the protocols followed.  However, we can get a reasonable estimate.\n\nLet's add up your CT DLP values:\n\n*   August 16th (Head): 1005.29\n*   September 22nd (Head): 799\n*   September 23rd (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis): 652\n*   September 25th (Head): 763\n*   November 15th (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis w/ contrast): 1291.11\n*   December 15th (Head): 881.17\n\n**Total DLP from CTs: 5391.57 mGy\u00b7cm**\n\nThe PET scan is different. PET scans use radioactive tracers, but the radiation dose from the tracer itself is typically higher than the CT component (which is used for attenuation correction and localization).  You state the PET scan's DLP as \"a fuck load\", unfortunately without an actual DLP value. The range of DLP from PET are between 20-60 mSv, however, the actual dose will vary between scanners, weight and the protocol performed. \n\n**Converting DLP to Effective Dose (mSv)**\n\nDLP needs to be converted to effective dose (measured in milliSieverts, mSv) to better understand the potential risk.  This conversion depends on the body region scanned. A rough conversion factor for head CTs is around 0.002 mSv/mGy\u00b7cm, and for abdomen/pelvis/chest, it\u2019s around 0.01 - 0.02 mSv/mGy\u00b7cm. Using these conversions:\n\n*   Head CTs (~3392.56 mGy\u00b7cm): ~6.8 mSv\n*   Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CTs (~2043.11 mGy\u00b7cm): ~20-40 mSv (Using Conversion range of 0.01-0.02)\n*   PET scan: Let's estimate 20mSv (it could be higher, but this is a conservative approach)\n\n**Estimated Total Effective Dose:** Approximately 46-66 mSv.\n\n**Let's put that into perspective:**\n\n*   **Average annual background radiation:** 3 mSv (from natural sources like cosmic rays, radon, and naturally occurring radioactive materials in the environment)\n*   **Typical chest X-ray:** 0.1 mSv\n*   **Transcontinental flight (round trip):** 0.05-0.1 mSv\n*   **Radiation worker annual limit (in well-controlled settings):** 20 mSv\n*   **Patient receiving radiation therapy (for cancer):**  Can receive *many* Grays (which convert to very high mSv) over weeks or months.  Far higher than your exposure.\n*   **Survivors of acute radiation exposure (e.g., Chernobyl):**  Typically receive doses *hundreds* or *thousands* of times higher.\n\n\n\n**Where You Stand**\n\nYour estimated total effective dose of 46-66 mSv is higher than the average annual background radiation, and it's above the annual limit for radiation workers. *However*, it is *significantly* lower than doses received during cancer radiation therapy or from major radiation accidents.\n\n**Cancer Risk Assessment**\n\nThis is the core of your concern. It\u2019s important to understand that *any* exposure to ionizing radiation carries a small increased risk of cancer. The risk is not zero, but it's generally considered to be *low* for doses in the range you've received. The risk is also dependent on age. Younger people are slightly more susceptible, but at 32, you're not in the highest risk group.\n\nSeveral organizations have assessed the risk:\n\n*   **National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP):** Estimates that for every 100 mSv of radiation exposure, the lifetime risk of cancer increases by approximately 0.4%.  So, your risk increase, based on ~60 mSv, is lower than that. \n*   **BEIR VII Report (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine):**  Provides detailed risk estimates based on various factors. \n\n**Your situation is not comparable to:**\n\n*   **Cancer treatment:** The doses given in radiation therapy are *targeted* at cancer cells, but are still very high. The benefit of treating the cancer far outweighs the risk of secondary cancers.\n*   **Radiation accidents:** These involve massive, uncontrolled exposure.\n\n**It *is* comparable to:**\n\n*  **Frequent Flyers:**  If you fly often, your cumulative radiation exposure can approach or exceed the levels you received from imaging.\n*   **Some diagnostic imaging protocols:**  Some complex diagnostic procedures, like cardiac imaging, can deliver comparable or even higher doses.\n\n**Addressing Your Concerns & Moving Forward**\n\n1.  **Talk to your Doctor:** Absolutely crucial.  Share your anxieties. Ask if they can provide a more precise dose estimate based on your specific scans and body size. Discuss if any specific screening recommendations are warranted.\n2.  **Focus on healthy lifestyle:** The best thing you can do to mitigate any potential risk is to maintain a healthy lifestyle: eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and minimize other known cancer risk factors.\n3. **Acceptance and Moving On**: You've gone through a stressful medical ordeal. It's understandable to be anxious.  Consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help process your experience and develop coping mechanisms for your anxiety. \n4. **Don't dwell on the past**. You can't change what happened, so focus on enjoying your improving health and building a positive future.\n\n\n**Why You Might Feel Extra Anxious (and why it's important to acknowledge it):**\n\n*   **Uncertainty of Illness:** The initial, unexplained nature of your symptoms and the diagnostic odyssey you went through are incredibly stressful.  The anxiety *from that experience* can amplify concerns about long-term effects.\n*    **\"Insult to Injury\" Feeling:** You rightly feel that the scans, while intended to help, were also an added stressor.  It's okay to feel resentful or frustrated about that.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **American College of Radiology:**  [https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/safety/radiation-risk.html](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/safety/radiation-risk.html)\n*   **National Cancer Institute:** [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation)\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nWhile your radiation exposure from the scans is not insignificant, it\u2019s also not a catastrophe. It's unlikely to significantly increase your long-term cancer risk, especially given your age and the fact that it's far below the levels seen in radiation therapy or accidents.  Focus on your recovery, have a conversation with your doctor, and prioritize a healthy lifestyle. You deserve to enjoy your life and not be consumed by worry.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're right to be skeptical! The vagus nerve is *very* trendy right now, and while there's a lot of legitimate science behind it, a lot of the claims are hyped or lack strong evidence. Let's break down what it is, what it does, what the evidence says about stimulation, and then address things specifically relevant to *you* given your health context.\n\n**What *is* the Vagus Nerve?**\n\nThink of the vagus nerve as the superhighway connecting your brain to a huge number of organs. It's the longest cranial nerve in the body, and it's a *major* component of the parasympathetic nervous system \u2013 the \"rest and digest\" system.  It's not just *one* nerve fiber, but a bundle of fibers.  It emerges from the brainstem and branches out *everywhere*, influencing:\n\n*   **Digestion:** Controls the movement of food through the digestive tract, stomach acid production, and gut motility.  A huge amount of communication goes between the gut and the brain via the vagus nerve.\n*   **Heart Rate:** Slows heart rate and lowers blood pressure.\n*   **Respiration:** Influences breathing rate.\n*   **Immune System:** Affects inflammation levels. It can regulate inflammatory responses.\n*   **Mood & Mental Health:** Plays a role in regulating anxiety, depression, and social connection.  It's linked to the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.\n*   **Voice & Swallowing:** Controls muscles in the throat.\n*   **Taste & Sensation:** Provides sensation in parts of the ear and throat.\n\n**What Does Stimulating It *Do*? (The Science)**\n\nThe idea is that by stimulating the vagus nerve, you can \"tone\" it, like exercising a muscle.  A \"toned\" vagus nerve is thought to be more efficient at regulating the body's functions, promoting that \"rest and digest\" state. Here's what the research *currently* says:\n\n*   **Digestion:** Vagal stimulation *can* improve digestive issues, especially those related to gut motility (like gastroparesis).  It's used medically (see \"Methods of Stimulation\" below).\n*   **Heart Rate & Blood Pressure:**  Studies *do* show vagal stimulation can lower heart rate and blood pressure, but the effect is often modest in otherwise healthy individuals.  It's more pronounced in people with hypertension.\n*   **Anxiety & Depression:** This is where things get more complex.  There's growing evidence that vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can help with treatment-resistant depression.  It's *approved* for this purpose in some cases (but it\u2019s not a first-line treatment).  The effect on general anxiety is less clear, but some studies suggest it can reduce symptoms. The gut-brain connection is really key here - a happier gut often means a happier brain.\n*   **Inflammation:**  Studies suggest vagal stimulation can reduce inflammation, potentially benefiting autoimmune conditions and chronic inflammatory diseases, but this is still an area of active research.\n*   **Migraines/Headaches:** Some emerging evidence suggests VNS can reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines.\n\n**Does it live up to the hype?**\n\nHonestly, much of the hype *is* overblown, *especially* regarding the easy at-home methods (see below).  The strongest evidence comes from *medical* VNS using implanted devices or non-invasive devices prescribed by doctors. \n\n**Methods of Stimulation: From Medical to DIY**\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Invasive VNS (Medical):** This involves surgically implanting a device that sends electrical pulses to the vagus nerve. Used for epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. *This is the method with the most robust scientific backing.*\n*   **Non-Invasive VNS (Medical):**  Devices that stimulate the vagus nerve through the skin, typically on the neck or ear.  These are being investigated for a wider range of conditions (migraines, inflammation, etc.) and *require medical supervision*.\n*   **\"DIY\" VNS (Very Mixed Evidence):** This is where most of the hype comes in.  These methods have *limited* scientific support, and the effects are likely to be much smaller than medical VNS:\n    *   **Cold Exposure:** Brief exposure to cold water (face dunk, cold showers) is thought to stimulate the vagus nerve.  *Some* evidence suggests it can improve mood and resilience.\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Slow, diaphragmatic breathing (6 breaths per minute) is a common technique. This *can* activate the parasympathetic nervous system and indirectly influence the vagus nerve.\n    *   **Singing/Humming/Gargling:** These activities activate muscles connected to the vagus nerve. *Limited* studies suggest potential benefits.\n    *   **Meditation/Yoga:**  These practices promote relaxation and can indirectly influence vagal tone.\n    *   **Probiotics/Gut Health:** Supporting a healthy gut microbiome can positively impact the vagus nerve due to the gut-brain connection.\n\n**Now, Let's Talk About *You* (35/F/White/115 pounds/Sertraline/Canada)**\n\nThis is important.  Here's what you need to consider:\n\n*   **Sertraline (Zoloft):** Sertraline is an SSRI antidepressant. SSRIs *also* affect serotonin levels in the brain, and can influence vagal tone.  There could be interactions or overlapping effects between sertraline and vagal nerve stimulation. *Talk to your doctor before trying any vagal nerve stimulation techniques.*  You want to avoid any unpredictable changes in your medication's efficacy or side effects.\n*   **Weight:**  115 pounds is a relatively low weight.  It's essential to ensure you're maintaining adequate nutrition.  Focusing *solely* on vagal nerve stimulation without addressing any underlying nutritional deficiencies could be counterproductive.\n*   **Canada & Access to Care:** Access to medical VNS or non-invasive VNS devices might be different in Canada than in the US.  Discuss options with your doctor.\n* **Underlying Conditions:** Are you dealing with anxiety, depression, digestive issues, or other conditions? This will influence how relevant VNS might be for you.\n\n**Is Stimulating the Vagus Nerve Bullshit?**\n\n*No*, it's not *completely* bullshit.  There's real physiology and some solid science behind it. However, the claim that you can effortlessly \"hack\" your vagus nerve with simple techniques and achieve dramatic improvements is often exaggerated.  \n\n**My Recommendation (and this is *not* medical advice):**\n\n1.  **Talk to your doctor.** Specifically, discuss your interest in vagal nerve stimulation *and* the fact that you're on sertraline.  Get their advice on whether it's appropriate for you, and what methods, if any, they recommend.\n2.  **Focus on foundational health.** Prioritize a balanced diet, regular exercise, good sleep, and stress management. These things *naturally* support vagal tone.\n3.  **If you're interested in \"DIY\" methods, start slowly and cautiously.**  Deep breathing is the safest and most well-supported starting point. Be mindful of how your body responds.\n4.  **Don't expect miracles.** Vagal nerve stimulation is likely to be *one piece* of a larger puzzle, not a cure-all.\n5.  **Be critical of the information you find online.**  There's a lot of misinformation out there. Look for sources that cite scientific research.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment."

        "question": "i was diagnosed when i was young with a seizure thing that goes away when youre 13, which impairs my ability to concentrate and gave me seizures while im sleeping about once every blood moon and my mom told me it was epilepsy, but see the thing is that shes not very good with english, and i have never had any trouble with seeing flashing lights. is it possible to have epilepsy but no trouble with seeing flashing colors?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good question, and it's smart of you to question things, especially given your mom's difficulty with English and your own experience not fitting the classic \"epilepsy\" picture.  It's also great that you're researching this and trying to understand what's going on. Let's break down the possibilities.\n\n**First, let's address your mom saying \"epilepsy.\"**  You're right to be cautious about assuming that's the correct diagnosis based on that alone.  Language barriers can easily lead to miscommunication, and \"seizure\" is a broad term.  \"Epilepsy\" specifically means a *tendency* to have recurrent, unprovoked seizures.  Just *having* a seizure doesn't automatically mean someone has epilepsy.\n\n**Now, regarding your specific situation and the flashing lights issue:**\n\nYou are absolutely correct - **you can definitely have some kinds of epilepsy and *not* be photosensitive (meaning not triggered by flashing lights).** Photosensitivity (the flashing light trigger) is a symptom *of some* types of epilepsy, but it's *not* a requirement for an epilepsy diagnosis.  In fact, a significant percentage of people with epilepsy are *not* photosensitive.\n\n**What could it be, given your description? Here are a few possibilities, and I'll try to explain them in a way that's easy to understand.  These are *not* diagnoses, just potentials based on what you've told me, and *you need a doctor to confirm anything*:**\n\n*   **Benign Rolandic Epilepsy (BRE) / Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS):** This is *very* common in childhood, and it sounds like this is a strong possibility, especially since you mentioned it went away around age 13.  \n    *   **Features:** Typically starts between ages 3 and 8, and usually resolves by adolescence (around age 13-15). Seizures often happen *during sleep*. They can cause facial twitching, drooling, and sometimes speech arrest (briefly stopping talking).  Concentration and learning difficulties can be associated with it. \n    *   **Photosensitivity:**  *Generally not* associated with BRE.\n    *   **Blood Moon Correlation?:** The \"once every blood moon\" thing is *very* interesting. It's a fascinating coincidence perhaps, or could potentially be tied to sleep cycle disruptions linked to lunar cycles or atmospheric pressure changes. It\u2019s unlikely the moon *causes* the seizures, but it could be a timing factor that overlaps with when you were already prone to them.\n*   **Other Childhood Epilepsy Syndromes:** There are other less common childhood epilepsy syndromes with unique features; a doctor would need to consider these based on a full evaluation.\n*   **Febrile Seizures:** If your first seizure(s) happened with a high fever as a young child, these are called febrile seizures. While a single instance isn't epilepsy, repeated febrile seizures can sometimes increase the risk of developing epilepsy later on.\n* **Nocturnal Seizures (Seizures that only happen during sleep):** Having seizures that *only* occur while sleeping is not uncommon in certain types of epilepsy \n*   **Not Epilepsy at all:** It's also possible the initial diagnosis was inaccurate, and what you experienced was something else entirely that mimicked seizures. Some neurological conditions, sleep disorders, or even certain migraines can have seizure-like symptoms.\n\n**Regarding the concentration issues:**\n\nMany neurological conditions, including epilepsy *and* even things that aren't epilepsy, can cause concentration difficulties. The seizures themselves can disrupt brain activity, and sometimes the underlying cause of the seizures can also affect attention.\n\n\n\n**What you *absolutely* need to do:**\n\n1.  **Medical Records:**  Try to get access to your medical records from when you were diagnosed. This is crucial. If your mom doesn\u2019t have them, the doctor who made the diagnosis should have them.  This will show exactly what tests were done, what the diagnosis was stated to be, and any treatment you received.\n2.  **Neurologist Visit:**  The *most important* thing is to see a neurologist (a doctor specializing in the brain and nervous system).  Explain your history fully \u2013 the seizures, the concentration difficulties, the age of onset and resolution, and the fact your mom may have had trouble communicating the original diagnosis. Specifically mention the \"blood moon\" timing \u2013 even if it sounds odd, it's important information.\n3. * **Testing:** The neurologist will likely want to perform an EEG (electroencephalogram) to measure your brain's electrical activity. They might also consider an MRI to look for any structural abnormalities in the brain.\n\n**Don't rely on internet searches for a diagnosis.**  I'm providing information to help you understand possibilities, but only a qualified medical professional can properly evaluate your situation and give you an accurate diagnosis.\n\n\n\nDo you have any other details you can share that might be helpful? (e.g., what did the seizures *look* like, any family history of seizures, any other medical conditions you have).\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me? No one has ever told me I had radiation necrosis. I guess I was always under the assumption my brain would heal itself after my radiation\u2026 but 4 years later it just seems to be getting worse. Does radiation necrosis heal/is it dangerous? Could this just be swelling? Did is progress fast from January 2022-April 2023? 4.. Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as a ischemic stroke? What is FLAIR hyperintensity? Those are just questions off the top of my head. I don\u2019t see a dr until June and google is not my friend.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack and you're absolutely right to be anxious and seeking clarity. It's also smart to avoid relying *solely* on Google, which can often be misleading or overly alarming.  Let's break down your questions based on the information you've provided and what your MRI report likely means.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is *not* medical advice.**\n\n**First, a Big Picture Overview**\n\nYou have a history of a brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation) and aneurysms treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery. Gamma Knife uses focused radiation to treat these abnormalities.  A known *potential* late complication of radiation therapy, including Gamma Knife, is radiation necrosis. This isn't a sign that the original treatment *failed* necessarily, but rather a delayed effect of the radiation on the brain tissue. You are also on a complex medication regime, which needs to be considered. The recent IUD insertion potentially coinciding with the onset of symptoms is good you note, as it helps your doctor think through possibilities.\n\n\n\n**Let's Tackle Your Questions, One by One**\n\n1. **Does radiation necrosis heal? Is it dangerous?**  This is complex. \n    * **Healing:** Radiation necrosis *can* sometimes improve over time, especially if it's mild. However, it doesn't usually \"heal\" completely, meaning the affected area doesn't fully return to its original state.  The brain *can* sometimes compensate around the damaged area. Sometimes it stabilizes, and other times it can progress.\n    * **Dangerous:**  It *can* be dangerous. The danger depends on the location and size of the necrosis.  Because it involves dead tissue, it can cause swelling (edema), which can increase pressure within the skull.  It can also lead to neurological deficits - the symptoms you are experiencing (vision changes, cognitive slowing, weakness).  In rare cases, it can be life-threatening.  However, many cases are managed with medication (like steroids to reduce swelling) and observation.\n2. **Could this just be swelling?** Yes, it *could* be swelling related to the necrosis.  Swelling is a common reaction to tissue damage.  The MRI report will likely indicate whether swelling is present. However, swelling can also be caused by many other things.\n3. **Did it progress fast from January 2022-April 2023?** It's difficult to say without seeing both MRI reports, but *if* the report shows a *new* area of necrosis or an *increase* in the size of previously identified necrosis, then yes, it could be considered progression. A 16 month period isn't necessarily *fast*, but it's worth investigating.\n4. **Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as an ischemic stroke?**  Not exactly the same, but there's some overlap in the *effects*.  \n    * **Ischemic Stroke:** A stroke is caused by a sudden *blockage* of a blood vessel, depriving brain tissue of oxygen.\n    * **Radiation Necrosis:** Radiation damages blood vessels over time which leads to reduced blood flow and eventual tissue death. It\u2019s not a sudden blockage, more of a consequence of radiation damage. Both result in dead brain tissue, and can cause similar symptoms, but the *mechanism* is different.  The focus with radiation necrosis is less about reversing a blockage and more about managing the effects of the dead tissue.\n5. **What is FLAIR hyperintensity?** FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is a type of MRI sequence. \"Hyperintensity\" means an area appears brighter on the scan than it should.  On a FLAIR scan, hyperintensity often indicates:\n    * **Edema (Swelling):**  Water accumulates in the tissue.\n    * **Inflammation:**  The area is inflamed.\n    * **Gliosis:**  Scar tissue formation.\n    * **Demyelination:** Damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers.\n    * **Necrosis:** Dead or dying tissue.\n    **In your case, FLAIR hyperintensity is likely related to the radiation necrosis, but it doesn't definitively *prove* it's necrosis. It's a sign that *something* is going on in that area.**\n\n\n\n**Regarding your MRI report (without seeing the report itself, this is general):**\n\n*   **\u201cOld Radiation Changes\u201d**: This is expected after Gamma Knife. It means the radiation has had an effect.\n*   **\u201cNew or Enlarging FLAIR Hyperintensity\u201d**: This is what's concerning. It suggests something is changing, potentially the necrosis getting worse, some swelling, or another process.\n*   **\u201cNo Significant Enhancement\u201d**:   This is a good sign. \"Enhancement\" with contrast dye can suggest inflammation or an active tumor.  The absence of significant enhancement suggests it is less likely to be an active tumor process.\n*   **\"Mass effect\u201d**: If mentioned, this means the abnormality is putting pressure on surrounding brain structures.\n\n\n**What to do before your June appointment:**\n\n*   **Write down ALL your symptoms:** Be very specific about when they started, how they\u2019ve changed, and what makes them better or worse.\n*   **Medication List:**  Bring an updated list of *all* your medications (including dosages).\n*   **Questions for the Doctor:** Write down your questions. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification.\n*  **Request a copy of your MRI report**: This will help you and your doctor discuss it thoroughly.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\n*I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.* This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The interpretation of an MRI scan is complex and requires the expertise of a radiologist and your neurosurgeon/neurologist. They will be able to correlate the imaging findings with your clinical symptoms and medical history to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.  \n\n\n\nI understand this is a scary situation, but you are being proactive by seeking information.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and get all your questions answered by your doctor."

        "question": "Sex: M Age 48 Weight 235lbs Height: 6ft 2\" non smoker, non drinker epilepsy since birth, had his hemispheres separated about 15 years ago. Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and you're understandably worried. You're a great partner for sticking with him and advocating for his care.  Let's break down your concerns and try to address them. I'll provide information, but **please read the disclaimer at the end** as I am *not* a medical professional and cannot give medical advice.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n* **Long-Standing Epilepsy & Corpus Callosotomy:** Your husband has a lifelong history of epilepsy, complicated by a corpus callosotomy (the separating of the brain hemispheres). This surgery is usually reserved for severe, generalized seizures that don't respond to medication.  It *can* reduce the frequency and severity of certain types of seizures, but it also introduces complexities in brain function.\n* **Increasing Seizure Frequency:** The fact that seizures are *increasing* after 7 years, despite medication adjustments, is a significant concern.  Simply \"upping the meds\" isn't always the best long-term solution, and it suggests the current approach might not be fully effective.\n* **The Calcification:** The calcification on the CT scan *could* be related to a previous injury, infection, stroke, or even a side effect of long-term seizures. While the neurologist says it\u2019s unchanged, that doesn't necessarily mean it's *not* contributing to the seizures.  Unchanged doesn\u2019t equal benign.\n* **The Headache/Seizure Pattern:** This is a *very* important observation.  The consistent pattern of a severe, medication-resistant headache *followed by* a seizure is suggestive of a potential underlying cause or a specific seizure type. This is a critical piece of information to bring to the neurologist.\n* **Postictal State:**  A postictal state lasting 10 minutes to an hour is on the longer side, and a 5+ hour postictal state is particularly alarming. This prolonged recovery period indicates a significant impact on brain function during and after the seizure.\n\n\n\n**Is This Manageable or Fixable?**\n\nYes, it *may* be manageable better, and in some cases, improvements can be made, but \"fixing\" epilepsy entirely is often not possible, especially with a longstanding history and a corpus callosotomy. The goal is typically to achieve the best possible seizure control with the fewest side effects, and maximizing quality of life.\n\nHere's what needs to be explored, and why simply increasing medication may not be the answer:\n\n1. **Refined Seizure Classification:**\n   * **Video EEG:**  This is *crucial*. A prolonged video-EEG monitoring session (ideally during sleep and awake) can capture a seizure event and precisely identify the *type* of seizure causing the symptoms.  Knowing what's happening in the brain *during* the seizure is essential for guiding treatment.  The corpus callosotomy alters how seizures manifest, so accurate classification is even more important.\n   * **Specifically look for Focal Onset Seizures:** Given the headache-seizure pattern, the seizures might be starting in a specific area of the brain (focal) and then spreading. A video EEG can help pinpoint the origin.\n2. **Investigate the Calcification Further:**\n   * **MRI:** An MRI of the brain provides significantly more detail than a CT scan. It can better characterize the calcification: its size, shape, location, and what it's composed of.  This can help determine if it is actively contributing to the seizures or is an incidental finding.\n3. **Medication Review:**\n    * **Drug Levels:**  Ensure your husband's Tegretol (carbamazepine) and antidepressant levels are within the therapeutic range. Blood levels fluctuate, and adjustments may be needed.\n    * **Drug Interactions:**  Review all medications (including over-the-counter) with the neurologist or a pharmacist to rule out potential interactions that could be reducing effectiveness or increasing seizure risk.  Antidepressants can sometimes interact with antiepileptic drugs.\n    * **Consider Alternative or Additional Medications:**  There are many antiepileptic drugs available. If Tegretol isn't providing adequate control, it might be time to explore other options (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine, brivaracetam, etc.). Combining medications (polytherapy) is often necessary.\n4. **Address the Headaches:**\n    * **Neurologist Consultation (again):**  Emphasize the *consistent* link between the headaches and seizures. Is the headache *aura* (a warning sign) or part of the seizure itself, or an independent issue?\n    * **Headache Specialist:**  If the headaches are particularly debilitating, a referral to a neurologist specializing in headaches might be beneficial.\n5. **Consider other potential causes:**  An EEG can rule out other causes of seizure-like activity.\n6. **VNS or RNS:** Vagous Nerve Stimulation (VNS) or Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) devices may be an option. RNS is more advanced and responds to seizures in real time. \n\n**What You Can Do**\n\n* **Keep a Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Record *everything*: date, time, duration of seizure, what happened before (especially the headache \u2013 severity, location, characteristics), what the seizure looked like, and the length of the postictal state.  This diary is invaluable for the neurologist.\n* **Be Assertive:**  You are your husband's advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, express your concerns, and request further investigation. If you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed, consider seeking a second opinion.\n* **Find a Specialist:**  Look for a neurologist who specializes in *epilepsy* and has experience with patients who have undergone corpus callosotomy.  Academic medical centers often have epilepsy centers with highly specialized expertise.\n* **Support Groups:**  Connect with other people and families affected by epilepsy.  Support groups can provide emotional support, practical advice, and a sense of community.  The Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) is a great resource.\n* **Emergency Plan:**  Ensure you have a clear emergency plan in place, including how to administer rescue medication (if prescribed) and when to call 911.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The information provided here should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care.\n\n\n\n**To help me potentially offer better (though still non-medical!) insights, can you tell me:**\n\n* **What is the name of the antidepressant he's taking?** (You don't have to share if it's private, but it could be relevant).\n* **Has he had an MRI of the brain?**\n* **How often does he see his neurologist?**\n* **Has he kept a detailed seizure diary previously?**\n\n\n\nI truly hope this is helpful.  It sounds like a challenging situation, but with diligent care and advocacy, you can work towards improving your husband's quality of life."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That sounds genuinely debilitating and incredibly frustrating. You're right to seek some insight, because that level of widespread, frequent muscle cramping is *not* normal and needs investigation. Given your medication list, and the long-standing nature of the problem, here's a breakdown of potential causes, things to discuss with your doctor, and what might be going on. **Please read the disclaimer at the end!**\n\n**First: Acknowledging the Complexity**\n\nYou are taking a *lot* of medications. The interactions between these, and their side effects, are a key area to explore.  While I'll list possibilities, it's crucial to understand this is likely multi-factorial, and a single 'cure' is unlikely.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes & What to Consider with Your Doctor:**\n\n**1. Medication Related:** This is the *first* place to start.\n    * **Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine):** This is a stimulant. Stimulants can definitely cause muscle tension, cramps, and tremors. It increases norepinephrine and dopamine, which can affect muscle excitability. This is one of the *most* likely contributors, especially with frequent use. The fact that cramps happen even *without* exertion makes this more probable.\n    * **Trintellix (Vortioxetine):** While less common, some SSRIs/SNRIs (Trintellix is an atypical antidepressant) can be linked to muscle spasms. It's less likely than Vyvanse, but should be considered.\n    * **Keppra (Levetiracetam):** This is for epilepsy, and muscle aches/spasms/cramps *are* a known side effect. It\u2019s important to discuss if the dose is optimal and if this is contributing.\n    * **Ranitidine (if still taking \u2013 see note below):**  While unlikely a direct cause of cramps, Ranitidine (Zantac) has been recalled due to contamination concerns and isn't generally prescribed anymore. *Please, discuss with your doctor whether you actually still need this, and if so, switch to a safer alternative.*  Low magnesium from reduced absorption is a *very* distant possibility.\n    * **Oral BC:** Can impact electrolyte balance & potentially contribute.\n    * **Drug Interactions:** The combination of all these meds could be creating synergistic effects you wouldn\u2019t see with just one.\n\n**2. Electrolyte Imbalances:**  This is extremely common with cramping and worth investigating.\n    * **Magnesium:** VERY crucial for muscle function.  Often deficient. Vyvanse and some antidepressants can affect magnesium levels.\n    * **Potassium:** Important for nerve and muscle function.\n    * **Calcium:**  Plays a role, but usually less of a direct cause of cramping than magnesium/potassium.\n    * **Sodium:** (though less likely with your lifestyle, could still play a part)\n    * **Testing:** Get a *comprehensive* electrolyte panel, ideally including RBC magnesium (more accurate than serum magnesium).\n\n**3. Neurological Factors (Beyond Epilepsy):**\n   * **Central Sensitization:**  Chronic pain/muscle issues can sometimes lead to a phenomenon where the nervous system becomes hyper-excitable, amplifying sensations \u2013 and making you more prone to perceive pain and spasms.  Your long history suggests this is possible.\n   * **Nerve Entrapment:**  Though less likely to be *widespread*,  it's worth considering if any specific areas of cramping seem to follow a nerve pathway.\n   * **Dystonia:** While less common, dystonia involves involuntary muscle contractions. The widespread nature of *your* cramping makes a classic dystonia less likely, but it's worth keeping in mind and discussing with a neurologist.\n\n**4. Dehydration:**  Even mild dehydration can contribute, especially if you don't drink enough water consistently.  You said you don't drink \u2013 this is something to really consider increasing.\n\n**5. Vaping:**  Vaping can cause subtle inflammation and potentially exacerbate muscle issues.  It's not a primary cause, but it's a contributing factor many overlook. The nicotine itself can have effects on muscle excitability, though it's less potent than a stimulant like Vyvanse.\n\n**6.  Less Likely, but Consider:**\n   * **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**  This impacts energy production in cells, and can sometimes manifest as muscle weakness and cramping. A very long shot, but worth considering if investigations are unrevealing.\n   * **Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome:** These conditions can cause widespread pain and muscle tenderness. It\u2019s possible, but often diagnosed by exclusion (ruling out other things first).\n\n\n\n**What You *Need* to Discuss with Your Doctor(s):**\n\n* **Detailed Medication Review:**  Bring a list of *everything* you take, including dosages and how long you've been on each med.  Ask about potential interactions and side effects. Specifically mention the cramping and if they link it to each medication.\n* **Electrolyte Testing:**  Insist on a comprehensive electrolyte panel (including RBC magnesium).\n* **Neurological Evaluation:**  You\u2019re already seeing for epilepsy \u2013 discuss the cramping with the neurologist. They may want to do further nerve conduction studies or other tests.\n* **Hydration Assessment:**  Honestly assess your water intake.\n* **Lifestyle Review:**  Discuss your level of activity (even \"standing around\" can be physically taxing).\n* **Keep a Detailed Cramp Diary:** Track *when* the cramps occur, the specific muscle involved, what you were doing beforehand, and the severity. This will be *incredibly* helpful for your doctor.\n* **Ask about Reducing or Switching Medications:** Don't be afraid to ask if reducing the Vyvanse dose or switching medications is possible, *under medical supervision*.  Do *not* stop medications abruptly.\n* **Consider a referral to a physician specializing in pain management.**\n\n**Things You Can Try (Alongside Medical Advice):**\n\n* **Magnesium Supplementation:** Discuss with your doctor *before* starting.  Magnesium glycinate is often well-tolerated.\n* **Increase Water Intake:** Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day.\n* **Gentle Stretching:** Regular, gentle stretching can help improve muscle flexibility.\n* **Heat/Cold Therapy:** Experiment with heat packs or ice packs to see what provides relief.\n* **Mindfulness/Relaxation Techniques:** Stress can worsen muscle tension.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

The information provided here is *not* a substitute for a proper medical evaluation and diagnosis.  Especially given your complex medical history and medication list, you absolutely *need* to be evaluated by a doctor.\n\n\n\n**To help me refine this further, could you tell me:**\n\n*   When did you first notice these cramps starting? Was there any life event/change happening around that time?\n*   Do any specific activities *reliably* trigger the cramps? (Other than the examples you've already provided)\n*   What is your typical daily water intake?\n*   Has your doctor mentioned anything about these cramps before?\n\nI sincerely hope you get some answers and relief soon!

        "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly distressing and complex. It's good you're reaching out and trying to understand what's happening. You're right to question whether this is anxiety, a recurrence of epilepsy, or something else.  Here\u2019s a breakdown of potential explanations, what needs to happen next, and things to consider.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end - this is not a substitute for medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms:**\n\n* **Deja Vu:**  While occasional deja vu is common, *frequent* or *intense* deja vu, especially coupled with other symptoms, can be a sign of neurological issues, including epilepsy. In epilepsy, deja vu can occur as an *aura* \u2013 a warning sign that a seizure may be starting, but it can also be a simple partial seizure in itself.\n* **Feeling of an Impending Attack/Episode:** This is also a very common aura symptom in different types of epilepsy.\n* **Panic Attack Symptoms (Heart Palpitations, Hyperventilation, Fear):** These overlap strongly with anxiety *and* can be part of a seizure.  Distinguishing between the two can be tricky.  The fact that these are prominent in your episodes doesn't rule out epilepsy, but it\u2019s essential to explore.\n* **Confusion & Memory Gaps:**  This is a key symptom to pay attention to.  Memory disturbances are common during and after seizures, even if the seizure activity isn't overt.  The confusion also fits with both panic attacks and post-ictal states (the period after a seizure).\n* **Post-Episode Fatigue & Sleep:**  This is very typical of both seizures (post-ictal fatigue) and severe panic attacks.\n* **Episodes During Sleep:** This is particularly important. Some types of seizures happen almost exclusively during sleep.\n* **Increased Frequency:** The fact that you had five episodes yesterday, including two during sleep, is a significant change and *definitely* warrants medical attention.\n* **Levetiracetam (Keppra):** You\u2019re on a relatively low dose (750mg). While effective for many, it might not be sufficient if your seizure threshold has changed or the type of seizure activity has evolved.\n\n\n\n**Possible Explanations (and why it\u2019s hard to self-diagnose):**\n\n1. **Epilepsy (Recurrence/Change in Seizure Type):**  The fact that you\u2019ve been seizure-free for two years *doesn't* mean you're cured. Epilepsy can change over time. Your seizures could be evolving into a different type that presents more subtly or with different auras.  The deja vu and feeling of impending doom are common auras.  The episodes during sleep are also a strong indicator to consider epilepsy. Auras can *be* the seizure.  Not all seizures involve convulsions.\n2. **Anxiety/Panic Disorder:** A panic attack can absolutely cause all the symptoms you describe \u2013 the fear, palpitations, breathing problems, confusion, and fatigue.  The lingering anxiety and fear of another attack are hallmarks of panic disorder.  However, the deja vu and the correlation with a past epilepsy diagnosis make this less likely as the *sole* explanation.\n3. **Post-Traumatic Stress (PTSD):**  If the initial epilepsy diagnosis or the seizures themselves were traumatic, these episodes could be related to PTSD.  The feeling of impending doom and flashbacks (which the deja vu could be interpreted as) are common in PTSD.\n4. **Other Neurological Conditions:** While less likely, other neurological conditions can cause similar symptoms. This is why a thorough evaluation is crucial.\n5. **Medication-Related (Less Likely):**  Levetiracetam is generally well-tolerated, but it's always worth considering whether a change in medication or dosage could be contributing. However, it's unlikely to *cause* these symptoms directly\n\n**What You *Need* To Do - and in this order:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATELY Contact Your Neurologist:**  This is the most important step. Tell them about the *increased frequency* of the episodes. Explain all your symptoms in detail, including the deja vu, the feeling of impending doom, the sleep episodes, and the confusion. Tell them about your anxiety.  Don't downplay anything.   An increase in episodes like this needs urgent investigation.\n2. **Consider Keeping a Detailed Seizure/Event Diary:**  Until you see your neurologist, start logging *everything*. Include:\n    * **Date and Time:**\n    * **What were you doing before the episode?** (Specific activities, emotional state, etc.)\n    * **What was the first symptom you noticed?** (The \"feeling of an attack,\" deja vu, etc.)\n    * **Detailed description of *all* symptoms:** (Physical sensations, thoughts, emotions, memory issues)\n    * **How long did the episode last?**\n    * **What happened immediately after?** (Fatigue, confusion, etc.)\n    * **Potential Triggers:** (Stress, sleep deprivation, illness, flashing lights, etc.)\n3. **EEGs (Electroencephalograms):** Your neurologist will likely order an EEG (probably a 24-hour or even longer ambulatory EEG) to look for abnormal brain activity.  *Crucially*, if your episodes occur primarily during sleep, you need a sleep-deprived EEG and/or a video-EEG during sleep.  Many seizures are missed on routine EEGs.\n4. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  Your neurologist might order an MRI of your brain to look for any structural abnormalities.\n\n5. **Consider a Mental Health Professional:** Even if the episodes are ultimately determined to be related to epilepsy, the anxiety and fear are significant issues that need to be addressed. A therapist specializing in anxiety or trauma could be very helpful.\n\n\n\n**Important Questions for Your Neurologist:**\n\n* \"Could these episodes be a change in my seizure type?\"\n* \"Is my current medication dosage still appropriate?\"\n* \"Should I undergo a 24-hour or ambulatory EEG, and specifically, should it include monitoring during sleep?\"\n* \u201cWhat are the potential differential diagnoses you are considering?\u201d\n* \"If this is anxiety, how can we rule out epilepsy definitively?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.

I can\u2019t sleep because of it, it makes my brain feel like it\u2019s about to fall, like it\u2019s falling, and sometimes I feel my brain vibrating, sometimes I feel an electrical feel going through my brain and moving, it feels like something is gonna happen like a seizure cause it feels like theres too much, like a sudden gush or surge of chemicals or something rushing into my brain and it\u2019s gonna make me have a seizure or something, im not epileptic but there are times when I wake up my body is completely jerking non stop and uncontrollable, my jaw my hands, all of it, it lasts for seconds, and I can\u2019t speak or make a voice, it\u2019s like non stop jerking and twitching and shaking and my jaw constantly jerks along with my body, idk if this is related to what I\u2019m feeling in my brain but iv had these \u201cjerks\u201d since a long time",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly distressing, and it's good you're reaching out. What you're describing is complex, and it's definitely something that needs a thorough medical evaluation. Here's a breakdown of what's concerning, potential avenues to explore, and what you should do next.  I will repeat the disclaimer at the end; **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.**\n\n**Key Symptoms & Concerns:**\n\n* **Breathing-Related Brain Sensations:** The crucial point is the *correlation* with breathing. Feeling good on inhale, worsening/lightheadedness on exhale is highly unusual.  This suggests something is sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, or potentially even cerebrospinal fluid dynamics related to the respiratory cycle.\n* **\"Fullness\" and \"Falling\" Sensations:** These sensations are suggestive of intracranial pressure changes, or a perception of instability.\n* **Brain Vibrations/Electrical Feelings:** This is very concerning and could indicate abnormal neural activity. The description raises concerns about possible sensory aura-like experiences.\n* **Jerking/Twitching/Myoclonus:** The involuntary jerks, especially those occurring during waking or sleep (potentially nocturnal myoclonus), are significant. The associated inability to speak adds another layer of concern.  The long-standing nature of these jerks is also important information.\n* **Lightheadedness & Dizziness:**  Common symptoms, but exacerbate the concern, especially paired with the brain sensations.\n* **Anemia & Iron Supplementation:** Anemia *can* cause dizziness and fatigue, however, your symptoms go beyond typical anemia presentation.  The fact you're already taking iron, liver, and blood-building supplements is important to noting, but doesn\u2019t explain the neurological symptoms.\n* **Fear of Seizure:** Your anxiety about a seizure is understandable given the sensations you're describing.\n\n\n\n**Possible (But Not Definitive) Considerations (These are for your information to discuss with a doctor, *not* self-diagnosis):**\n\n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** POTS can cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog, and can sometimes be affected by breathing.  However, the specific sensations you describe are less typical for POTS alone.\n* **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Pressure Issues:** While rare, fluctuations in CSF pressure (either high or low) can cause symptoms similar to what you're describing, and can potentially be influenced by breathing/position.\n* **Neurological Sensitivities/Migraine Aura:** Some neurological conditions present with unusual sensory perceptions, and auras can sometimes feel like vibrations, electrical sensations, or changes in pressure. The relationship with breathing is atypical, though.\n* **Inner Ear Issues:** While less likely given the neurological component, a vestibular (inner ear) problem *could* contribute to dizziness and some of the disequilibrium feelings.\n* **Anxiety/Panic:** It is important to rule out, and anxiety *can* manifest with physical symptoms, but the specific neurological sensations you detail are not typical solely anxiety. Anxiety can often exacerbate existing issues.\n* **Medication Side Effects/Interactions:** While less probable, it is important to mention all medications to the doctor, and to inquire about possible side effects or interactions.\n\n\n\n**Crucial Next Steps \u2013 What You *Must* Do:**\n\n1. **See a Doctor IMMEDIATELY:**  Do *not* delay.  Given the neurological symptoms and the impact on your sleep and daily life, this requires prompt medical attention. Preferably see a neurologist.  If you can\u2019t get an immediate appointment, go to an urgent care or emergency room. Explain all of your symptoms in detail, including the specifics of the breathing correlation.\n2. **Detailed Medical History:** Be prepared to provide a comprehensive medical history.  Include:\n    *   When the jerking started (as you mention it's been long-term)\n    *   Family history of neurological conditions (seizures, migraines, etc.).\n    *   Any recent illnesses or infections.\n    *   Any changes in lifestyle or stress levels.\n3. **Diagnostic Tests:**  You\u2019ll likely need several tests.  Be prepared for these.  Potential tests include:\n    *   **Neurological Exam:** A thorough assessment of your reflexes, coordination, and sensory function.\n    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** To assess brain electrical activity and rule out seizure activity. *Especially important given the jerking and your concerns.*\n    *   **MRI of the Brain:** To look for structural abnormalities.\n    *   **Blood Tests:** Comprehensive bloodwork to check for anemia, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid function, vitamin deficiencies, and other potential causes. A complete blood count (CBC) will be repeated as well.\n    *   **Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Monitoring:** including lying, sitting, and standing, to assess for POTS.\n    *   **Vestibular Testing:** To assess inner ear function (if deemed necessary by the doctor).\n\n\n\n**Important Things to Tell the Doctor:**\n\n*   **The Breathing Correlation:** *Emphasize* the link between your breathing and the sensations.  This is the most important clue.\n*   **Specificity of the Sensations:** Be as precise as possible when describing the buzzing, vibrations, falling feeling, and electrical sensations.  Where exactly in your brain do you feel them?\n*   **Impact on Daily Life:** Explain how these symptoms are affecting your sleep, concentration, and overall functionality.\n*   **Medications & Supplements:** List *everything* you are taking, including dosages.\n\n**While Waiting for Medical Attention:**\n\n*   **Avoid Sudden Movements:**  Try to move slowly to minimize any potential worsening of symptoms.\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water.\n*  **Safe Environment** If you feel an episode coming on, especially with the jerking, ensure you are in a safe place where you can\u2019t injure yourself.\n*   **Limit Stress:** As much as possible, try to reduce stress until you can see a doctor.\n* **Keep a Symptom Diary:** This can be helpful to share with the doctor. Note when symptoms occur, their severity, and any potential triggers.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you've done a *very* good job of being a detective on your own health. It absolutely makes sense that you're landing on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) given your history and the pieces you've put together.  Let's break down why, and then I'll give you some advice on what to do next.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 I am not a doctor and cannot provide medical diagnoses.**\n\n**Why Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Feels Like a Good Fit (Based on What You've Shared)**\n\n* **Seizure Description:** Your description of feeling like you're going to be sick *before* the loss of consciousness, followed by a post-ictal state with deja vu, is quite typical for complex partial (focal) seizures originating in the temporal lobe.  Grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures *can* start as focal seizures that then generalize (spread to the entire brain).\n* **Aura (The \"Feeling Like Gonna Throw Up\"):** This \"feeling like I'm going to throw up\" is *very* frequently described as an aura for temporal lobe seizures. Auras are the initial, often subtle, warning signs of a seizure.\n* **Childhood Experiences:** This is where you've done really insightful work.  Your childhood experiences \u2013 sound sensitivity, feelings of distortion (ceiling far away, hands bigger), and unexplained emotional breakdowns \u2013 are *highly suggestive* of simple partial seizures or interictal (between seizure) activity originating in the temporal lobe. Children often have difficulty articulating these experiences, so they can be dismissed as quirks.\n* **Deja Vu:**  Frequent deja vu is a classic symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy.  The temporal lobe is crucially involved in memory, and abnormal electrical activity can create the sensation of familiarity when there isn't one.  The deja vu *after* the seizure could be a post-ictal phenomenon as well.\n* **MRI Normal:**  A normal MRI doesn't rule out TLE.  Many people with TLE have normal structural brain scans.  TLE is often caused by subtle abnormalities in brain *function* rather than obvious structural damage.\n* **EEG Findings:** \u201cSome abnormal activities on the left side of the brain\u201d is important, even if it wasn't definitive. The left temporal lobe is often implicated in TLE.\n* **Tonsillectomy & Mono:** This is an interesting point. While not directly causative, viral infections *can* sometimes trigger or exacerbate epilepsy in susceptible individuals. The inflammation and immune response could theoretically have a role, though it's hard to say for sure. It\u2019s worth mentioning to the neurologist.\n\n\n\n**What You Need to Do Now (Advice)**\n\n1. **Be Assertive with Neurologists:**  You've been waiting a year. That's too long. You need a neurologist specializing in epilepsy.  Here's how to approach this:\n    * **Call the Neurologist Who Referred You:**  Politely but firmly ask for an update on the referral.  Ask *specifically* for the name and contact information of the epilepsy specialist they recommended.\n    * **If the Referral is Stalled:** If you're getting nowhere, consider getting a referral from your primary care physician.  You have the right to seek a second (or third) opinion.\n    * **Find an Epilepsy Center:** Look for a Level 4 Epilepsy Center (the highest designation) near you. These centers have comprehensive diagnostic and treatment capabilities. You can find a list here:  [https://www.epilepsy.com/living-epilepsy/find-epilepsy-center](https://www.epilepsy.com/living-epilepsy/find-epilepsy-center)\n\n2. **Prepare a Detailed History:**  Because investigations are ongoing, I recommend preparing a detailed history to present to the epilepsy specialist:\n    * **Seizure Diary:**  Document EVERY seizure (even if you suspect it was very brief). Include:\n        * Date and time\n        * What you were doing\n        * What you felt *before* the seizure (the aura \u2013 even if it's just a vague feeling)\n        * What happened *during* the seizure (as best as you can remember or as reported by witnesses)\n        * What you felt *after* the seizure (confusion, tiredness, headache, deja vu, etc.)\n        * How long everything lasted\n    * **Childhood History:** Write down *everything* you've remembered about those childhood experiences \u2013 the sound sensitivity, the distortions, the unexplained emotional reactions, the refusal to go places. Include approximate ages.\n    * **Medical History:**  List all illnesses, surgeries (especially the tonsillectomy and mono), medications, and allergies.\n    * **Family History:**  Ask your family if anyone else has seizures, epilepsy, or unexplained neurological symptoms.\n\n3. **Ask About Further Testing:**  While you've had an MRI and EEGs, here's what the specialist might consider:\n    * **Long-Term EEG Monitoring (Video-EEG):**  This is the gold standard for diagnosing epilepsy. You'll be monitored in a hospital setting for several days, with continuous EEG recording and video surveillance. This can capture a seizure and pinpoint the exact location in the brain where it originates.\n    * **Neuropsychological Testing:**  This assesses your cognitive functions (memory, language, attention) and can help identify subtle deficits that might be related to temporal lobe dysfunction.\n    * **fMRI (Functional MRI):**  This can measure brain activity during specific tasks and help identify areas that are malfunctioning. (Though not always necessary, especially if video-EEG is conclusive).\n    * **SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography):** This can detect areas of decreased blood flow in the brain, which can sometimes indicate a seizure focus. ( Less common these days with improved EEG tech)\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n* **Don't Self-Treat:** Continue to follow your doctor's instructions. Don't start any new medications or treatments without their approval.\n* **Safety Precautions:** Until you have a diagnosis and treatment plan, take precautions to minimize risks:\n    * Avoid driving if your seizures aren't controlled or if your doctor advises against it.\n    * Avoid activities that could be dangerous if you were to have a seizure (swimming alone, working at heights, etc.).\n    * Tell close friends and family about your seizures and what to do if you have one.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably worrying, but you're *very* smart to be proactive and seeking more information. Let's break down elevated eosinophils (eosinophilia) and what it could mean, particularly in your specific context.  I'll preface this with a **very important disclaimer at the end: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only. You *must* follow up with your hematologist.**\n\n**Understanding Eosinophils & Eosinophilia**\n\nEosinophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in your immune system. They're most known for fighting parasites, but they also are involved in allergic reactions and inflammation.  Your neurologist's \"fighting a parasite\" explanation, while a common starting point of thinking about eosinophilia, isn't necessarily the *only* or even the *most likely* explanation when a parasite hasn't been found.\n\n**22% is definitely elevated.**  The \"normal\" range varies slightly between labs, but generally, above 5-8% is considered eosinophilia.  Anything over 10% warrants investigation.\n\n**Possible Causes of Eosinophilia (Beyond Parasites - since you've ruled that out):**\n\nHere's a breakdown, categorized, ranging from more common/less serious to less common/more serious. I\u2019ll try to highlight those that are *possible* given your other medication and lack of immediate symptoms.\n\n* **Allergic Conditions (You say you have no allergies, but it\u2019s complex):**\n    * **Asthma:**  Even if you don't have classic asthma symptoms, eosinophils can be elevated in some forms of asthma.\n    * **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever):**  Sometimes, a subtle allergic response can cause elevation.\n    * **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE):**  An allergic condition of the esophagus.  This often presents with swallowing difficulties, but can be mild initially.\n    * **Drug Reactions:** **This is highly relevant given *your* medication list.** Certain drugs can induce eosinophilia.  This is one of the *first* things your hematologist will be considering.\n* **Skin Conditions:** Some skin issues like eczema or certain rashes can cause eosinophil increases.\n* **Inflammatory Conditions:**\n    * **Vasculitis:** Inflammation of blood vessels.  There are many different types.\n    * **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):** Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  These usually present with digestive symptoms, but not always.\n* **Autoimmune Diseases:**  Many autoimmune conditions can be associated with eosinophilia.\n* **Hematologic (Blood) Disorders:**  *This is what the Hematologist is investigating!*\n    * **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES):** This is a rare group of disorders where eosinophils are persistently and significantly elevated, causing organ damage.\n    * **Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia (CEL):** A rare type of blood cancer.\n    * **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms:** Other blood disorders where the bone marrow makes too many blood cells.\n* **Less Common Causes:**  Certain cancers (lymphoma, solid tumors), infections (even viral ones) can sometimes cause eosinophilia.\n\n\n\n**Your Specific Situation: Key Considerations**\n\n* **Medication Side Effect:**  Given your epilepsy medication (Topamax, Rivotril) and Venlafaxine, a drug-induced eosinophilia is *very* likely.  These medications can, in some individuals, trigger an immune response. This is the most likely avenue your hematologist will pursue first.\n* **Epilepsy itself:** While less common, sometimes the underlying cause of epilepsy causes a subtle inflammatory process that elevates eosinophils.\n* **No Symptoms:** The fact that you don't have obvious symptoms is *somewhat* reassuring, but eosinophilia can be present for a long time before symptoms appear, especially in some of the more serious conditions.\n* **Age & Weight:** Your age is relatively young, and your weight is within a healthy range.  These are generally positive factors.\n* **Location:** Being Caucasian doesn\u2019t rule anything in or out, but some eosinophilic syndromes have higher prevalence in certain ethnic groups.\n\n\n\n\n**What the Hematologist Will Likely Do:**\n\nYour hematologist will take a thorough history and perform a physical exam. Then they will likely order:\n\n* **Repeat Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential:** To confirm the eosinophilia and check other blood cell counts.\n* **Peripheral Blood Smear:**  A microscopic examination of your blood to look at the shape and appearance of your blood cells.\n* **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP):**  Markers of inflammation.\n* **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**  Deficiencies can sometimes affect blood cell counts.\n* **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel:** To assess kidney and liver function.\n* **Stool Examination:** Even though you haven\u2019t travelled, they may want to rule out a possible hidden parasitic infection.\n* **Possibly, Allergy Testing:** To look for subtle sensitivities.\n* **Consideration of Medication Review:** A detailed look at your medications and timing of the eosinophilia onset.  They may consider a trial off one or more medications (under your neurologist's careful guidance) to see if eosinophil levels decrease.\n* **Bone Marrow Biopsy (possibly):**  This is usually reserved for more persistent or severe eosinophilia, or if they suspect a hematologic disorder. Don't panic about this \u2013 it's not always necessary.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Can Do Now:**\n\n* **Keep a detailed symptom diary:** Note *anything* unusual, even if it seems minor. Headaches, fatigue, any new skin changes, digestive issues, etc.\n* **Make a complete medication list:** Include doses, how long you\u2019ve been on them, and any recent changes.\n* **Prepare to answer questions about your medical history:**  Be ready to discuss any past illnesses, surgeries, family history of allergies, autoimmune disease, or cancer.\n* **Write down your questions:**  This will help you make the most of your appointment with the hematologist.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. Do not self-diagnose or self-treat.

Try to stay calm \u2013  elevated eosinophils are often benign, and often manageable once the cause is identified. Good luck with your appointment!"

        "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really interesting and well-described experience. It's understandable why you're curious, and frustrating that your doctor hasn't explored it further, even if it's not significantly impairing. While I *cannot* diagnose you (I am an AI and not a medical professional), I can offer some thoughts about what this *could* be, and why it's good you're continuing to seek information.  It's definitely worth pushing for a more thorough evaluation, even if it means seeking a second opinion.  Here\u2019s a breakdown of possibilities, and what to consider, grouped by likelihood, along with advice on how to proceed:\n\n**1. Possible Neurological Phenomena (Worth Investigating - Most Important)**\n\n* **Simple Partial Seizures (Focal Seizures without impaired awareness):**  This is the first thing that comes to mind, given your description.  Even though you don\u2019t have full-blown convulsions,  seizures aren't always dramatic. Simple partial seizures can manifest with sensory disturbances like ringing in the ears (auditory aura), a feeling of being \"out of it\" (a subtle altered awareness),  and even brief balance disturbances. The fact that these are triggered by specific stimuli (old objects, memories) is *not* unusual - sensory triggers are common in epilepsy.  The temporal lobe, which is critical for memory, is a common area for seizure activity to originate.  The feeling of being \"almost lost your balance\" is also sometimes seen with temporal lobe events.\n    * **Why your doctor might dismiss it:** These types of seizures can be subtle, brief, and infrequent.  If you don\u2019t have a clear, consistent loss of consciousness or obvious motor symptoms, they can be easy to overlook, *especially* if you function normally otherwise.\n    * **Why it needs investigation:**  Even mild seizures can indicate underlying brain activity that warrants attention.  There are many treatable forms of epilepsy.\n\n* **Temporal Lobe Sensitivity/Hyperexcitability:**  Related to the above, but perhaps not a full seizure.  The temporal lobe is very sensitive and prone to unusual sensations.  Sometimes, strong memories and associated sensory details *can* evoke a brief burst of neural activity that feels strange. This could be a milder expression of the same underlying tendency as simple partial seizures.\n\n* **Occipital Lobe Activity:** While less likely given the auditory component, the visual nature of triggering events (mural, sticker dispenser) could involve some atypical processing in the occipital lobe. Occipital lobe epilepsy can sometimes cause visual disturbances accompanied by other sensory symptoms.\n\n**2. Less Directly Neurological, But Possible (Worth Considering)**\n\n* **Migraine Aura:** While typically associated with headaches, some people experience migraines *without* headache, and the aura can be purely sensory (visual, auditory, even a feeling of disconnection).  The triggering nature related to memories is less typical for migraine, but not impossible.\n\n* **Sensory Processing Sensitivity:** Some people have a naturally higher sensitivity to sensory input. A strong memory triggered by a sensory cue might overwhelm their processing, leading to a temporary overload and unusual sensations. \n\n* **Dissociation:**  This is a disconnection between thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity. While usually linked to trauma, milder forms can occur in response to strong emotional triggers or sensory overload.  The \"out of it\" feeling and feeling detached could point to this.\n\n\n\n**3. The \"Cannot Compute\" Theory & Why it Makes Sense**\n\nYour description of a \"cannot compute\" error is insightful.  The brain is attempting a complex reconstruction of the past \u2013 sights, sounds, smells, emotions \u2013 and *something* about that process is causing a momentary glitch.  This is congruent with the neurological possibilities outlined above. The brain might be trying to rapidly access and integrate a lot of information, and a subtle irregularity in that process could be the cause. \n\n\n\n**What You Should Do (Actionable Advice)**\n\n1. **Second Opinion:**  *Seriously* consider seeking a second opinion from a neurologist. Ideally, find one who specializes in epilepsy or complex neurological conditions.  Don\u2019t downplay the events; clearly describe *everything* you\u2019ve told me.\n2. **Seizure Diary:**  Start a detailed diary of these events.  Include:\n    * **Date and Time**\n    * **Precise Trigger:** What specific object, image, memory, or thought was present?\n    * **Detailed Description of Symptoms:**  Include *everything* you feel \u2013 the ringing, the \"out of it\" sensation, balance issues, any visual changes, any emotional components.  Level of intensity, on a scale of 1-10.\n    * **Duration:**  How long do the symptoms last?\n    * **Post-Event Feelings:**  Any lingering effects (headache, fatigue, confusion)?\n    * **Context:** Where are you?  What were you doing right *before*?\n3. **Ask About Testing:** Specifically request the following:\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This measures brain activity.  It's the standard test for epilepsy.  *Ask for a prolonged EEG* - sometimes events don\u2019t happen during a standard short EEG. Sleep-deprived EEG can also increase chances of capturing an event.\n    * **MRI of the Brain:** This can rule out structural abnormalities.\n4. **Consider a Video-EEG:** This is the most definitive diagnostic tool. It involves continuous EEG monitoring combined with video recording. If you can reliably trigger the event with certain stimuli, a video-EEG may be able to capture it.   This will likely require a hospital stay.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\n\n\nDon't give up on finding answers. Your experiences are valid and deserve investigation.  The fact that you're observant and articulate in describing them is a huge help, and a good neurologist will appreciate that information.

        "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really valid concern, and it's good you're thinking it through *before* undergoing this test. Here's a breakdown of what you should be considering, and why it's crucial to speak with a doctor (and perhaps even get a second opinion).  I'll cover the risks, what's likely, and what you absolutely need to do.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n* **Childhood Head Injury & Epilepsy:** You had epilepsy *as a result* of a head injury when you were very young. This is important. This suggests the epilepsy was likely symptomatic - meaning it was *caused* by something (the injury) rather than being a primary, genetic epilepsy.  The brain has a remarkable capacity for healing and reorganization, particularly in young children.  The fact that you've been seizure-free for 20+ years is very positive.\n* **Long Remission:**  20+ years seizure-free is generally considered a significant period of remission.  It doesn't *guarantee* the epilepsy is gone forever, but it drastically reduces the probability of recurrence.  Many doctors would consider you to be in a good long-term remission.\n* **Stun Guns & Neurological Effects:** Stun guns work by disrupting the body's electrical impulses, which *do* affect the nervous system.  The effects are generally temporary, causing muscle contractions and temporary disorientation.  *However*, they can potentially trigger seizures in individuals with a predisposition to them. This is the core of your concern.\n* **The Job Requirement:**  This is a highly unusual job requirement. It's legitimate to question the necessity and safety of a stun gun test.\n\n\n\n**Why Your Concern is Valid**\n\n* **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Even though you've been symptom-free for 20 years, the initial head injury *and* the subsequent epilepsy mean there may be some underlying neurological vulnerability.  The brain area affected by the injury may still be slightly more sensitive.\n* **Potential for Reactivation:** While unlikely, a strong electrical stimulus *could* theoretically disrupt brain activity enough to potentially trigger a seizure, even after a long period of remission.  The likelihood is very hard to quantify and depends on many factors.\n* **Unknown Threshold:**  You don\u2019t know your current seizure threshold (if any remains).  You have no recent data about how your brain would react to such stimulation.\n* **Psychological Stress:** The anxiety surrounding the test itself could potentially contribute to neurological symptoms in someone with a history like yours.  Stress *can* be a seizure trigger for some people.\n\n**What You *Must* Do Before Agreeing to the Test**\n\n1. **Consult a Neurologist:** **This is not optional.**  You *need* to see a neurologist. Explain your history thoroughly \u2013 the head injury, the childhood epilepsy, the length of remission, and the specifics of the job test.  The neurologist can:\n    * **Evaluate your risk:** Based on your history and potentially some basic tests (EEG, perhaps MRI depending on the neurologist's assessment), they can give you a professional assessment of your risk of a seizure being triggered.\n    * **Provide informed consent:** They can help you understand the potential risks and benefits of undergoing the test.\n    * **Discuss potential safeguards:**  If they deem the risk acceptable (even with precautions), they can advise on safety measures.\n2. **Ask Specific Questions of the Employer:**\n    * **Why is this test necessary?**  What specific skills or reactions are they trying to assess?  Is it *absolutely* essential, or is there an alternative way to evaluate your suitability?\n    * **What are the protocols for the test?**  Who will be administering it? What is the intensity level? What safeguards are in place (medical personnel present, monitoring equipment, etc.)?\n    * **Liability:** What is the company's liability if you *were* to have a seizure as a result of the test?\n3. **Second Opinion:**  If you are not comfortable with the neurologist\u2019s assessment, or if you want further reassurance, get a second opinion from another neurologist.\n\n**Important Considerations and Potential Safeguards (If Approved by a Doctor)**\n\n* **Medical Supervision:**  If, *and only if*, a neurologist clears you with precautions, the test *must* be administered under the direct supervision of qualified medical personnel (a doctor, paramedic, or at least a skilled nurse).  They need to be prepared to manage a seizure if one occurs.\n* **Controlled Setting:** The test should be conducted in a safe, controlled environment with padding and clear space around you.\n* **Low Intensity:**  Request that the stun gun be used at the lowest possible effective intensity.\n* **Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of your vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure) and possibly EEG during the test is advisable.\n* **Have Someone with you:** Have a trusted person present who is aware of your medical history.\n\n\n\n**Likelihood:**\n\nIt is **unlikely** that a stun gun would trigger a seizure after 20 years of remission, *especially* if your epilepsy was related to a resolved injury. However, it\u2019s not zero. The risk is not insignificant enough to proceed without thorough medical evaluation.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nYour health and safety are paramount. Don't feel pressured to undergo this test if you have concerns. A responsible employer will respect your need for medical evaluation and will prioritize your well-being.  **Do not proceed without the explicit clearance of a neurologist.**\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I am a 23 year old women I was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease and other chronic inflammation about 8 years ago, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy, on top of that I have cysts throughout my body. I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to navigate, and it's good you're proactively looking for information to understand the connections between your conditions.  It's incredibly common for people with complex chronic illnesses to feel like they're piecing together a puzzle, and understanding these potential links can be empowering.  Here's a breakdown addressing both your requests, with a lot of detail, potential leads, and caveats.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end! This is not medical advice.**\n\n**1. Inflammation and Epilepsy: A Growing Area of Understanding**\n\nYou're right to look into the connection!  For a long time, epilepsy was largely considered a purely neurological disorder.  However, there's a *significant* and growing body of evidence pointing to inflammation as a contributing factor \u2013 and, in some cases, even a trigger \u2013 for seizures.  Here's a detailed look:\n\n* **How Inflammation Can Impact Brain Activity:** Inflammation doesn't directly cause neurons to fire randomly (usually). Instead, it can disrupt brain function in several ways:\n    * **Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption:** Chronic inflammation can weaken the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This normally protects the brain from harmful substances, but a leaky BBB allows inflammatory molecules (cytokines, etc.) to enter the brain.\n    * **Neurotransmitter Imbalance:** Inflammation can alter the levels and activity of neurotransmitters like GABA (inhibitory, reduces excitability) and glutamate (excitatory, increases excitability).  Shifting this balance toward excitation can lower the seizure threshold.\n    * **Microglial Activation:** Microglia are the brain's immune cells.  While they're important for brain health, *chronic* activation of microglia contributes to neuroinflammation and can contribute to seizures.\n    * **Altered Neuronal Excitability:** Inflammatory molecules can directly affect the excitability of neurons, making them more prone to firing abnormally.\n    * **Epileptogenesis:** Prolonged inflammation can even contribute to *epileptogenesis*, the process by which a normal brain develops into one prone to seizures.\n* **Specific Inflammatory Conditions & Epilepsy Links:**\n    * **Autoimmune Epilepsy:** This is where the immune system attacks the brain, causing seizures.  Often associated with specific antibodies.  (Your Crohn's falls into this category)\n    * **Infections:**  Past central nervous system infections (even childhood ones) can leave lingering inflammation and increase seizure risk.\n    * **Vascular Inflammation:** Conditions like vasculitis can affect blood flow to the brain and cause seizures.\n    * **Autoimmune Diseases (Like Crohn's):** This is *highly* relevant to your situation.  There's a documented increased risk of epilepsy in people with autoimmune conditions like Crohn's.  As you know, Crohn's is driven by chronic gut inflammation, and this systemic inflammation can impact the brain, as described above.  The inflammation from Crohn's can also lead to nutrient deficiencies (Vitamin D, B12, etc.) which can also impact neurological function.\n\n* **Research & Leads:**\n    * **NIH (National Institutes of Health):** Search the NIH website (www.nih.gov) for studies on \"epilepsy inflammation\" or \"autoimmune epilepsy.\"\n    * **Epilepsy Foundation:**  Their website (www.epilepsy.com) has information on comorbidities, including autoimmune conditions.\n    * **PubMed:**  A database of medical research. Search terms: \"epilepsy Crohn's disease,\" \"inflammation epileptogenesis,\" \"neuroinflammation seizure threshold.\" [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)\n    * **Studies on Cytokines:** Look for research on specific cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and their role in epilepsy.\n    * **Gut-Brain Axis:**  Research the gut-brain axis \u2013 the bidirectional communication between your gut microbiome and your brain.  Dysbiosis (imbalance in gut bacteria) is common in Crohn's and can contribute to systemic inflammation *and* potentially affect brain function.\n\n\n\n**2. Cysts and Inflammation: Could They Be Connected?**\n\nThis is a more nuanced question, as \"cysts\" is a broad term.  The connection to inflammation *depends heavily on the type of cysts you have, where they are located, and their characteristics.*\n\n* **General Mechanisms:** Inflammation can contribute to cyst formation in several ways:\n    * **Chronic Inflammation & Tissue Repair:**  Repeated or chronic inflammation can lead to abnormal tissue repair, resulting in cyst-like structures.  The body tries to wall off areas of damage, but sometimes this process goes awry.\n    * **Immune Response:**  In autoimmune conditions like Crohn's, an overactive immune system can target healthy tissues, leading to inflammation and potentially cyst development.\n    * **Cellular Changes:**  Inflammation can alter cell behavior, leading to fluid buildup or the formation of cyst linings.\n\n* **Specific Cyst Types and Inflammation Links (relevant possibilities, *need doctor confirmation*):**\n    * **Ovarian Cysts:**  Inflammation is often implicated in the development of some ovarian cysts (especially endometriomas\u2014cysts related to endometriosis).  Systemic inflammation, as seen in Crohn's, could potentially contribute.\n    * **Breast Cysts:**  Inflammation can play a role in breast cyst development.  Hormonal fluctuations can also contribute but inflammation can worsen it.\n    * **Skin Cysts (Epidermoid/Sebaceous Cysts):**  Minor trauma or blockage of a duct can lead to these, and *inflammation can contribute to their growth and potential infection.*  Crohn's can sometimes manifest with skin involvement.\n    * **Kidney Cysts:**  While often genetic, inflammation associated with chronic kidney disease (which *can* be a complication of some inflammatory conditions) can contribute to cyst formation.\n    * **Other Cysts:**  If you have cysts in other organs (liver, lungs, etc.), the link to inflammation would need to be assessed based on the specific type of cyst and your overall condition.\n\n* **What to Discuss with Your Doctor:**\n    * **Type of Cysts:**  *Exactly* what kind of cysts do you have?  Where are they located?\n    * **Imaging Reports:**  Bring copies of any imaging reports (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI) to your appointment.\n    * **Inflammation Markers:**  Ask your doctor about your inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, etc.). Are they consistently elevated?\n    * **Cyst Characteristics:**  Are the cysts growing?  Are they causing symptoms?  Are they fluid-filled or solid?\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations & What to Do Next:**\n\n* **Multidisciplinary Care:** You need a team of doctors working together. This *should* include a neurologist (for epilepsy), a gastroenterologist (for Crohn\u2019s), and potentially other specialists depending on the type and location of your cysts.\n* **Medication Review:**  Some medications used to treat Crohn's or epilepsy can have side effects that might contribute to inflammation or other issues.  Review your medications with your doctors.\n* **Lifestyle Factors:**  Diet, stress management, and sleep are crucial for managing inflammation.  An anti-inflammatory diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids) may be helpful.\n* **Gut Health:**  Given your Crohn's diagnosis, optimizing your gut health is paramount.  Talk to your doctor about probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary strategies.\n* **Advocate for Yourself:**  Don't be afraid to ask questions, express your concerns, and seek second opinions if you're not satisfied with the answers you're getting.\n\n\n\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The connections between inflammation, epilepsy, and cyst formation are complex and highly individual. Your specific situation requires a thorough evaluation by your doctors.  Do not self-treat or change your treatment plan based on information you find online.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful.  Please remember to discuss everything with your healthcare team.  I wish you the best in navigating these challenges.

        "question": "I live in Japan, and so sometimes with doctors there can be some miscommunication. I usually check online to make sure before taking things. Long story short, I was on Zoloft 50mg for 6 years. Started getting twitches, changed to Lexapro, it made my anxiety worse, now I'm off of it. But since about 2 years ago I have had constant off-center / dizziness, along with motor function weirdness (wobbly legs, right hand/right leg cramps, joint pain, trouble with finite motor skills like writing), and speech issues. Though these things are not very noticeable to people (other than that I feel sick due to this perceptual oscilating-like dizziness which has made it difficult to work, it's very noticeable to me. I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics. I have had MRI, multiple blood tests, x-rays, seen an ENT, a bone doctor (ultrasound on right hand due to joint pain) and I'm sure more... my next step is I plan to see a doctor to see if I have a pinched nerve or bulged disc etc, but that wouldn't explain my speech and dizziness issues. I'm sorry if I trailed off. Is this medicine within the realm of what I should be taking? Thank you. Age: 36 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight: 190lbs Suffering: 2 long years........ Medication: about 2000mg of Magnesium per day due to bowel issues.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and it's very good you're proactively researching and questioning things, especially given potential communication challenges in a healthcare system different from your origin.  Let's break down your situation and the prescription of Selenica-R, and try to offer some thoughts, *but please read the disclaimer at the very end, as this is not medical advice.*\n\n**Understanding Your Symptoms**\n\nYou're describing a constellation of symptoms \u2013 dizziness, motor issues (weakness, cramps, clumsiness), joint pain, and speech difficulties \u2013 that have persisted for *two years*.  The fact that they're subtle to others is important, but the *impact on your life* is the key point.  It sounds truly debilitating to have this constant sense of being off-balance and to struggle with everyday tasks.\n\nHere's how I categorize what you're reporting:\n\n* **Neurological:** The dizziness, motor function issues (wobbly legs, cramps, fine motor difficulties), and speech issues strongly point to a neurological component.  This *doesn't necessarily mean* a serious condition, but it signals the nervous system is involved.\n* **Musculoskeletal:** The joint pain and cramps could be independent issues, or they could be *related* to the neurological problems (e.g., weakness leading to strain, altered gait causing joint stress).\n* **History of SSRI Use:** Your history of Zoloft and Lexapro *is highly relevant*.  SSRIs can, in some cases, have withdrawal syndromes that linger, and also can *unmask* underlying neurological vulnerabilities. While six years is a good length of time to be on an SSRI, withdrawal can still present with atypical symptoms.\n* **Unresponsive to Initial Treatments:** The Kamyo (herbal medicine) and extensive testing without a clear diagnosis are frustratingly common.\n\n\n\n\n**Selenica-R (Phenytoin) \u2013 The Big Question**\n\nSelenica-R contains Phenytoin, a medication primarily used to *control seizures* (epilepsy).  It works by stabilizing nerve cell activity in the brain.  The fact that your doctor is considering this, despite the absence of *confirmed* seizures (you haven't mentioned them), is the main point of concern. \n\n**Here's why it's unusual, and questions to ask your doctor:**\n\n* **It's an aggressive treatment:** Phenytoin isn't a \"first-line\" medication for vague neurological symptoms. It's a powerful drug with potential side effects and requires careful monitoring.\n* **Differential Diagnosis:**  What is your doctor *specifically* trying to treat with Phenytoin?  What condition are they suspecting that would justify this choice?  (They should be able to articulate this clearly.) The fact you haven't been diagnosed with epilepsy makes this perplexing. \n* **Possible Explanations (Speculative \u2013 *Ask Your Doctor!*):** I can only offer possibilities, which *should not replace a thorough discussion with your doctor*:\n    * **Subclinical Seizures:** Your doctor might suspect you're having very mild seizures that aren't obvious, and that are causing the neurological symptoms.  An EEG (electroencephalogram) would be crucial to investigate that.\n    * **Neuropathic Pain:** Phenytoin *can* sometimes be used for certain types of nerve pain, but it\u2019s generally not preferred.\n    * **Misinterpretation of Symptoms:** It's possible your symptoms are being interpreted as potentially seizure-related, even if they aren't.\n    * **Trying something \"off-label\":** While possible, prescribing a powerful medication off-label without a clear rationale is concerning.\n* **Side Effects:** Phenytoin has a significant side effect profile (dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, coordination problems, skin rashes, and more serious potential effects).  You need to thoroughly understand these risks.\n\n**Regarding Your Magnesium Intake:**\n\n2000mg of Magnesium daily is *extremely high*. While magnesium is vital, excessive intake can cause diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping, and in severe cases, irregular heartbeat and kidney problems. The fact that you\u2019re taking this much likely *because* of bowel issues is a red flag \u2013 it suggests a cycle of taking more magnesium to counteract the side effects of too much magnesium.  Discuss this with your doctor urgently and consider a more moderate, targeted approach if possible.\n\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do (Priorities):**\n\n1. **Directly Question the Selenica-R Prescription:**  This is *crucial*.  Ask your doctor, in a clear and direct way:\n    * \"Why are you prescribing Selenica-R to me?  I understand it is an anti-epileptic medication, and I have not been diagnosed with epilepsy.  What specific condition are you trying to treat?\"\n    * \"What are the potential side effects of this medication, and how will they be monitored?\"\n    * \"Are there alternative treatments we could consider first?\"\n2. **Neurological Specialist (Critical):**  If you haven't already, you *must* see a neurologist. This is the specialist best equipped to evaluate your symptoms and determine the underlying cause.  Request a referral.\n3. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  Ask your neurologist about getting an EEG to rule out any seizure activity, even if it's subtle.\n4. **Spinal Evaluation:** You're already planning to see someone about a pinched nerve/bulged disc. That's good.  However, remember that a spinal issue alone may not explain all your symptoms.\n5. **Review Medication History:**  Provide the neurologist with a complete list of all medications you've taken, including the Zoloft, Lexapro, duration of use, and any withdrawal symptoms you experienced.\n6. **Reduce Magnesium:** Immediately discuss with your doctor about safely reducing your magnesium intake.  High doses on their own can cause neurological symptoms like dizziness and weakness.\n7. **Consider Second Opinion:** Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another doctor, especially if you are not satisfied with the explanation for the Selenica-R prescription.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your situation is complex, and professional medical evaluation and guidance are absolutely necessary.  Cultural and language barriers can exacerbate this, so don't be afraid to bring a trusted friend or family member to appointments to help with communication.\n\n\n\nI truly hope you get to the bottom of this and find some relief.  Two years of these symptoms is a long time, and you deserve a clear diagnosis and effective treatment.  Please prioritize getting a thorough neurological evaluation."

        "question": "I (24 years old, male assigned at birth (currently on HRT), middle-eastern) am always curious about different diseases I may get. Mostly because of family/relative backgrounds. Recently for a project, I had a bunch of electroencephalography results to do a bunch of machine-learning experiments with. I found most of those people suffered from Epilepsy, and as I don't know anything about them, I am curious about the disease. Can it happen with no reason? (I mean, a simple misfunctioning in brain) One of my mom's cousins had the disease and it resulted his death. Does it mean I am in danger? or his children are more in danger?     Can drugs/medications result the disease? I read the wikipedia page of the topic. I found smokers or alcoholic people are more in danger. But I am curious about the medications for depression or anxiety (like Citalopram). Ok, I think I asked enough. So, I'll be thankful of your answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, it's great you're being proactive about your health and thinking about these things, especially given your family history and recent exposure to EEG data. It's perfectly normal to become concerned when hearing about a disease, particularly one that had a tragic outcome for a relative. Let's break down your questions about Epilepsy.  I will preface this with a **disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for professional medical consultation.**\n\n**1. Can Epilepsy Happen With No Reason (Simple Brain Misfunctioning)?**\n\nYes, very often.  In a significant number of epilepsy cases (~60%), no specific cause can be identified. This is called **idiopathic epilepsy**. It\u2019s thought to be due to a spontaneous, underlying abnormality in the brain's electrical activity, genetic predisposition, or subtle brain structure differences that aren't visible on standard imaging. It\u2019s not necessarily a \u201cmisfunctioning\u201d in the sense of something *causing* damage, but rather a difference in how the brain is wired or functions from the start, making it more prone to seizures.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cno reason.\u201d It just means we haven\u2019t *found* the reason yet.  Sometimes the reason is very subtle and won\u2019t be obvious even with extensive testing.\n\n**2. Family History: Are You/Your Cousin's Children in Danger?**\n\nThis is where it gets a bit more nuanced.  Having a family history *does* increase your risk, but it doesn't guarantee you, or your cousin's children, will develop epilepsy.\n\n*   **Genetic Component:**  Some forms of epilepsy *are* directly inherited due to specific genetic mutations. However, most epilepsy is *not* caused by a single gene. It's more complex, involving multiple genes and environmental factors.\n*   **Risk Increases, Doesn't Guarantee:**  If one first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) has epilepsy, your risk is somewhat elevated.  The risk is higher if the epilepsy is a genetic form. Your cousin is not a first-degree relative, so the risk is less pronounced, but still exists.\n*   **Your Cousin\u2019s Death:** It's crucial to know *how* your cousin died.  Was it a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)?  Was it a consequence of a seizure injury? The circumstances of his death matter, as SUDEP has some associated risk factors that might be similar within a family to some extent.\n*   **Your Cousin's Children:** They have a slightly higher risk than the general population but are not guaranteed to develop epilepsy. Their risk depends on the type of epilepsy their father had and whether it has a known genetic cause.\n\n**In your case:** The fact you're on HRT introduces another layer. HRT can sometimes (rarely) affect neurological function, although studies are still ongoing and the risks are generally considered low.  *It's important to discuss your family history with your endocrinologist and primary care physician, especially in the context of your HRT.*\n\n**3. Can Drugs/Medications Result in Epilepsy?**\n\nYes, certain medications can, in rare cases, lower the seizure threshold, meaning they make it easier for seizures to start. This is called **secondary epilepsy.** \n\n*   **Specific Drugs:**  Some culprits include certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, antibiotics, stoping alcohol or benzodiazepines abruptly, some pain medications, and even certain over-the-counter medications in susceptible individuals.\n*   **Citalopram (and other SSRIs):**  SSRIs like Citalopram are generally *not* considered a major risk factor for causing epilepsy. However, they *can* lower the seizure threshold, especially in people who are already predisposed to seizures (e.g., due to a genetic factor, brain injury, or another neurological condition).  The risk is usually very small, but it\u2019s something your doctor knows.\n*   **Important Note on SSRIs:** SSRIs are generally more likely to *unmask* underlying epilepsy that wasn't previously diagnosed than to *cause* epilepsy de novo. This means someone might have a subtle tendency towards seizures that's revealed when they start an SSRI.\n\n**4. Smoking and Alcohol**\n\nYou're right to note the association. Chronic, heavy alcohol use and smoking are established risk factors for epilepsy, though often through indirect mechanisms like brain damage from alcohol-related issues or vascular problems.\n\n**Regarding your specific situation:**\n\n*   **Regularly discuss your family history *and* HRT with your doctors.** This is critical.\n*   **Be open with your doctors about any medications you're taking.**  This includes prescribed medications, over-the-counter drugs, and any supplements.\n*   **Maintain a healthy lifestyle.** This includes avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol intake, getting enough sleep, and managing stress.\n* **If you experience any symptoms suggestive of seizures (even briefly) \u2013 such as staring spells, unusual movements, confusion, loss of awareness, or tingling sensations \u2013 *see a doctor immediately*.**\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)  (Excellent information and support)\n*   **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS):** [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/) (Research-based information)\n*   **CDC Epilepsy Page:** [https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html)\n\n**To reiterate: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good and responsible question, and it's smart of you to be thinking about this and seeking information. It's also smart that you *didn't* stop the video when you started feeling uncomfortable - that helps give us information. Let's break this down.  I'm an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses, but I can give you information that can help you understand the situation and what to do next.\n\n**1. Is it possible you have epilepsy?**\n\nYes, it's *possible*, but **highly unlikely** based on what you've described. Here\u2019s why:\n\n*   **You haven't had a seizure:** The defining characteristic of epilepsy is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Feeling \"off\" or uncomfortable with flashing lights is *not* the same as having a seizure.\n*   **Photosensitivity is common:** Many people (estimated around 3% of the population, but likely more undiagnosed) are *photosensitive* \u2013 meaning flashing lights can trigger discomfort or other reactions. This does *not* mean they have epilepsy.  It\u2019s a normal variation in brain activity.\n*   **Your reaction:**  The \u201coff\u201d feeling and \u201cimpending doom\u201d you experienced are things people *often* report with photosensitivity, *even without* having epilepsy. It's an unpleasant sensation, but not a seizure.\n*   **Passing the video:** You tolerated the entire epilepsy test video, even though it made you uncomfortable. A person *with* seizure-prone epilepsy would be significantly more likely to have a reaction (even a subtle one) during that type of stimulation.\n\n\n\n**2. Is it normal for flashing lights to bother people without epilepsy?**\n\n**Yes, absolutely.** Photosensitivity exists on a spectrum.  Some people are very sensitive and can have seizures triggered by lights. Others feel only mild discomfort, like you describe.  Reasons for photosensitivity are varied and not fully understood but relate to how the brain processes visual stimuli.  Things that can increase sensitivity include:\n\n*   **Fatigue:** Being tired makes people more susceptible.\n*   **Stress:**  Stress levels can play a role.\n*   **Illness:** Being sick can lower seizure thresholds.\n*   **Dehydration:** Proper hydration is important for brain function.\n*  **Migraines:** People who experience migraines are often more sensitive to light.\n* **Pattern Specificity:** Some patterns (high contrast, certain frequencies) are more likely to trigger reactions.\n\n\n\n**3.  Could watching the epilepsy test video make you *more* susceptible to epilepsy?**\n\n**Extremely unlikely.**  There's a very low risk of *provoking* a first-time seizure in someone who doesn't have an underlying predisposition to epilepsy by watching flashing lights.  You've already done the relevant \"provocation\" by watching the video, and you didn't have a seizure.  The anxiety surrounding epilepsy and deliberately seeking out a trigger likely amplified your discomfort *during* the video, but didn't cause any lasting change.\n\n**However, it's understandable you\u2019re feeling anxious about this. Trying to \"test\" yourself with flashing lights isn't generally recommended, especially if you feel uncomfortable. It's better to avoid situations that cause you distress.**\n\n**4. What should you do now?**\n\n*   **Talk to your doctor:** This is the most important step. Describe your experiences at the concert and with the TV show, and your concerns about epilepsy. Your doctor can assess your overall health, rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, and determine if further evaluation is necessary.  They may ask about your family history of seizures or neurological conditions.\n*   **Keep a log:** For a week or two, note when you experience the \"off\" feeling with flashing lights.  Include details like:\n    *   What were you doing?\n    *   What kind of flashing lights were involved (fast, slow, color, pattern)?\n    *   How long did the feeling last?\n    *   What other symptoms, if any, did you experience (headache, nausea, dizziness)?\n*   **Avoid triggers (if possible):** If you know certain types of flashing lights bother you, try to minimize your exposure. This doesn\u2019t mean drastically changing your life, but being mindful.  (e.g., sitting further from flashing lights at events).\n*   **Manage stress and prioritize sleep:** These are good general health practices that can also help with photosensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly unsettling and anxiety-inducing, especially given your doctor's initial suggestion of temporal lobe epilepsy and now the increased frequency of these episodes. It's *very* understandable you're worried, and it's good you're reaching out.  Let's break down your concerns, and then I'll give you a considered response.  I will preface this with a **disclaimer at the end: I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you *must* discuss this with a medical professional.**\n\n**Let's review what you're describing.  These symptoms strongly suggest some form of neurological event, and it's good you're being proactive in following up.  Here's a summary of your symptoms:**\n\n* **Prodrome (Beginning):** Dizziness, sharp eye pain.\n* **During Episode:** Zoning out, rapid-fire deja vu/memories/visions, blurred vision, slurred speech, hot flushes, nausea.\n* **Post-Episode:** Lightheadedness, prolonged \"zoned out\" feeling, difficulty with auditory processing (not hearing things when spoken to), amnesia for the event itself.\n* **Frequency:** Increasing \u2013 went from infrequent to 3 episodes in one day.\n* **Initial Diagnosis Consideration:** Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)\n* **MRI Result:** Clear\n\n**Should You Be Worried?**\n\nYes, absolutely. An increase in frequency, combined with the complex nature of your symptoms, warrants further investigation *despite* a clear MRI.  Your doctor's \"not to worry\" response sounds dismissive considering the escalation.  Three episodes in a single day is a significant change, and you're right to question it. It\u2019s appropriate to be concerned.  This isn\u2019t a \u201cwait and see\u201d situation anymore.\n\n**Can an MRI Miss Temporal Lobe Epilepsy?**\n\nThis is a very important question, and the answer is: **yes, it absolutely can.** Here's why:\n\n* **MRI Sensitivity:** While MRIs are excellent, they're not perfect.  Some forms of epilepsy, particularly TLE, can occur in areas of the brain that are subtle or don't show up on standard MRI protocols.  Specifically:\n    * **Hippocampal Sclerosis:** A common finding in TLE, it can be subtle and not always visible on MRI, *especially* if early in the process. Advanced MRI techniques can improve detection (see \"Further Testing\" below).\n    * **Subtle Cortical Dysplasia:** Abnormal brain development can cause seizures without obvious structural changes detectable on a standard MRI.\n    * **Epileptiform Activity Isn't Structure:** An MRI shows *structure*. Epilepsy is about *electrical activity*. An MRI can show changes *caused* by epilepsy over time, but it won't see a seizure happening (or the predisposition to one) directly.\n* **Interictal vs. Ictal MRI:**  An MRI is usually done \"interictally\" \u2013 meaning between seizures. It's harder to see changes when you *aren't* actively seizing.\n* **MRI Protocol:** The *type* of MRI matters. A standard brain MRI might not be as detailed as one specifically looking for epilepsy.  \n\n\n**What Could Be Going On? (Beyond TLE)**\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider other possibilities, even with the strong TLE symptom picture. Your doctor needs to explore these.\n\n* **Other Seizure Types:** There are many types of seizures besides TLE.  Some might not have obvious structural causes.\n* **Migraine with Aura:** While your doctor mentioned migraine, your symptoms are complex for a typical migraine aura. However, it\u2019s still possible, and some migraines *can* present with very unusual neurological symptoms.  \n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** These are episodes that *look* like seizures but have a psychological origin.  They can be very distressing and have similar symptoms. Diagnosing PNES requires specialized monitoring (see below). *This is not to say your symptoms are \"not real\" - they are very real experiences, just with a different cause.*\n* **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):**  A \u201cmini-stroke.\u201d Less likely given your age (you haven\u2019t stated it but I\u2019m assuming you are young based on your language), but needs to be considered.\n* **Cardiac Issues:** Occasionally, heart arrhythmias can cause brief neurological symptoms.\n* **Neurological Autoimmune Conditions:** Some autoimmune conditions can affect the brain and cause similar symptoms.\n\n\n\n**What You Need to Do \u2013 Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Demand Further Evaluation:**  You need to see a neurologist, preferably one specializing in epilepsy, *as soon as possible*.  Explain the increase in frequency and your concerns about the initial dismissal.  Be assertive.\n2. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This is *crucial*. An EEG measures electrical activity in the brain.  It\u2019s the primary test to diagnose epilepsy.  \n    * **Routine EEG:** A standard EEG, but often doesn't catch seizures if they are infrequent.\n    * **Prolonged EEG (24-72 hour):**  Much more likely to capture an event. You might need to be admitted to the hospital for this.\n    * **Video-EEG Monitoring:** This is the gold standard. You are monitored with both EEG and a video camera for several days or weeks to capture an event on camera, allowing doctors to correlate the electrical activity with your symptoms. This is especially important if they are considering PNES.\n3. **Advanced MRI:** Ask your neurologist about:\n    * **High-Resolution MRI:**  More detailed imaging.\n    * **Hippocampal Volumetry:** Specifically measures the size of the hippocampus, which can be reduced in TLE.\n4. **Detailed Neurological Exam:**  A thorough examination by a neurologist, assessing reflexes, coordination, sensory function, etc.\n5. **Keep a Detailed Symptom Diary:** Immediately after each episode, write down *everything* you remember, even fragmented thoughts or sensations. This will be invaluable for the neurologist. Include time of day, what you were doing, and any potential triggers.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Driving:** Be very cautious about driving until you have a diagnosis and your doctor advises you it's safe.\n* **Safety:**  Avoid activities that could be dangerous if you were to have an episode (swimming, operating machinery, heights).\n* **Stress:**  Stress can exacerbate neurological symptoms.  Practice relaxation techniques.\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts, and the Disclaimer:**\n\nYour instincts are telling you something is wrong, and you are justified in seeking more answers.  Don\u2019t accept a dismissive response when your symptoms are escalating.  Advocate for yourself, be persistent, and seek a thorough evaluation by a neurologist specializing in epilepsy. \n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My current age is 31. Height: 5'7\" Weight: 140 lbs. I have been having convulsive seizures almost every month since I turned 26. These seizures almost exclusively occur within an hour of waking up. I walk around the house for up to half an hour, burning up. Could stress be a trigger for these episodes? I also have times where I get euphoric and nauseous, but they never last very long.Basically, what I want to know is, what is going on in my head. Is this temporal lobe epilepsy? Focal onset seizures with secondary generalization? I had 9 seizures Monday. Keppra is not working for me, and I need to be recommended some other anticonvulsant. Please help me. Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a serious and concerning situation. You're experiencing frequent seizures, Keppra isn't controlling them, and you're understandably anxious to understand what's happening and find effective treatment.  I'm going to break down your situation, discuss possible explanations, and then *very importantly* explain why I can't provide medical *recommendations* and what steps you **must** take.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  I will emphasize this again at the end.\n\n\n\n**Let's Analyze Your Symptoms:**\n\nYou've given some very helpful details. Here's a breakdown of what stands out:\n\n* **Age of Onset (26):**  While epilepsy can emerge at any age, a new onset in your mid-20s warrants careful investigation.\n* **Seizure Frequency (Monthly, now 9 in one day):**  This is a high frequency, and the recent spike is particularly alarming.  Uncontrolled seizures are a medical emergency.\n* **Timing (Within 1 hour of waking):** This is a *very* significant clue.  Seizures predominantly occurring shortly after waking strongly suggests a pattern. This often points towards nocturnal or post-sleep seizures.\n* **Aura/Pre-Ictal Phase (Burning sensation, walking around):**  The \"burning up\" and automatism (walking around without full awareness) suggest an aura or pre-ictal phase. This is activity *before* the full convulsion.  Automatisms are very common in temporal lobe seizures.\n* **Post-Ictal Symptoms (Euphoria/Nausea):**  Euphoria and nausea are known post-ictal symptoms (after a seizure). The fleeting nature of the euphoria is also common.\n* **Keppra Ineffectiveness:**  Keppra (levetiracetam) is often a first-line medication, but it doesn't work for everyone. Its failure to control your seizures means a different approach is needed.\n* **Your Height/Weight:**  Your BMI is within a healthy range, so weight isn't immediately a significant factor.\n* **Stress as a Potential Trigger:** Stress can absolutely lower the seizure threshold in many people with epilepsy.\n\n\n\n**Possible Explanations (What your doctor will be considering):**\n\nBased on your description, here are some possibilities.  These are *not* diagnoses \u2013 only your neurologist can determine that:\n\n1. **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):**  This is a strong possibility, given the timing of seizures, possible auras (the burning sensation could be part of an aura), and post-ictal symptoms. TLE often involves seizures originating in the temporal lobes of the brain, which can cause complex symptoms like automatisms, strange sensations, and emotional changes.  The fact they happen near wakefulness is very suggestive.\n2. **Focal Onset Seizures with Secondary Generalization:**  This means the seizure *starts* in one area of the brain (focal onset \u2013 which the temporal lobe would be), and then spreads to involve the whole brain, resulting in a convulsion.  This is consistent with your description.\n3. **Other Focal Epilepsies:** Seizures can originate from other areas of the brain. Investigation is necessary.\n4. **Sleep-Related Epilepsy:**  Because of the timing, a sleep study (EEG during sleep) might be very revealing.  There are specific epilepsy syndromes that manifest primarily during sleep or the transition to/from sleep.\n5. **Other Neurological Conditions:**  Less likely, but a neurologist will want to rule out other causes for your symptoms, such as structural brain abnormalities (tumors, lesions), metabolic disorders, or autoimmune conditions.\n\n\n\n\n**Why Keppra May Not Be Working & What About Other Medications?**\n\n* **Individual Response:**  People respond differently to medications. What works for one person may not work for another.\n* **Seizure Type:**  Keppra is effective for certain seizure types but less so for others.\n* **Drug Metabolism:** Your body processes medications at different rates.\n* **Dosage:** Sometimes, the dosage needs to be adjusted. However, you've likely already been on an adequate dose if it's been tried for a significant period.\n\n**Regarding other anticonvulsants, here are some that your doctor might consider (but *they* must make the decision, not me):**\n\n* **Lamotrigine (Lamictal):** Often good for focal seizures, but requires slow titration to avoid rash.\n* **Carbamazepine (Tegretol):**  Effective for many types of epilepsy, but has more drug interactions and requires blood monitoring.\n* **Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal):** Similar to carbamazepine, but often better tolerated.\n* **Topiramate (Topamax):**  Can be effective, but has potential side effects like cognitive difficulties and weight loss.\n* **Valproic Acid (Depakote):**  Broad-spectrum, meaning it works for many types of seizures, but has significant potential side effects, especially in women of childbearing age.\n* **Brivaracetam (Briviact):**  Similar to Levetiracetam (Keppra) but potentially with fewer side effects.\n* **Phenytoin (Dilantin):** An older medication but can be effective. Requires careful monitoring.\n* **Zonisamide (Zonegran):** Another broad-spectrum option.\n\n**Important Note about medication:**  Switching medications should *always* be done under the strict guidance of your neurologist.  Abruptly stopping or changing medications can be dangerous and provoke seizures.\n\n\n\n\n**What You MUST Do NOW:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION:**  **Nine seizures in one day is a medical emergency.** Go to the Emergency Room *immediately*, or have someone drive you.  Do *not* drive yourself.  Status epilepticus (prolonged seizure activity or a cluster of seizures without full recovery between them) is a real risk.\n2. **Neurologist Follow-Up (ASAP):**  If you're not already under the care of a neurologist specializing in epilepsy, you *need* to be.  Schedule an appointment as soon as possible, even after the ER visit.\n3. **Detailed Seizure Diary:**  Keep a detailed record of your seizures:\n    * Date and Time\n    * Duration\n    * What were you doing before the seizure?\n    * What did the seizure look like (describe the movements, what you felt)?\n    * What happened *after* the seizure (post-ictal state \u2013 confusion, weakness, headache, euphoria, nausea, etc.)?\n    * Any potential triggers (stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, etc.).\n4. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  Your neurologist will almost certainly order an EEG, likely both a routine EEG *and* a prolonged or ambulatory EEG (to capture seizures over a longer period, including during sleep). A sleep deprived EEG may also be ordered.\n5. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  An MRI of the brain is crucial to look for structural abnormalities.\n6. **Discuss Medication Options:**  Work with your neurologist to explore alternative medications.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and express your concerns.\n\n\n\n**I repeat: I cannot prescribe or recommend any specific medication.**  My role is to provide information, not medical advice.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **CDC Epilepsy:** [https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/index.html)\n\n\n\n\nPlease, take this seriously and seek immediate medical attention. Your health and safety are paramount.  I sincerely hope you find answers and effective treatment soon.  Good luck, and please keep me updated (while understanding I can't provide medical guidance)."

However I started reading about it, there were some concerns reported last month that it may cause Neurological disorder and muscle paralysis.So as a someone who is treating from mild epilepsy (occurred to me only 4 times and usually my diagnosis are good) for about 6 years , should I be concerned about it ? also if I have the chance to take AstraZeneca should I do it ?Would appreciate your response because I can't reach to my Dr. at the moment",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really good and responsible question, especially given your medical history. It's smart of you to be proactive and seek information. Let's break down the concerns about the Johnson & Johnson (J&J/Janssen) and AstraZeneca vaccines, *specifically* in the context of someone with a history of mild epilepsy.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end of this response, as this is *not* a substitute for professional medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Concerns - J&J/Janssen Vaccine & Neurological Issues**\n\nYou are right to have picked up on the reports.  The J&J/Janssen vaccine *has* been linked to a very rare syndrome called **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS)**, and in some much rarer cases, **Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)**.  Both can have neurological components. \n\n* **GBS:** This is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the nerves.  Symptoms can include muscle weakness, paralysis, tingling sensations, and pain. While generally treatable, it can be serious.\n* **TTS:**  This involves blood clots *with* a low platelet count. It can cause stroke, and other serious problems. Neurological symptoms can occur if the clots affect the brain.\n\n**The key word here is *rare*.** The risk is very low \u2013 estimated at around 3-5 cases per million people vaccinated with J&J. However, *because* it involves the neurological system, it understandably raises concerns for individuals with pre-existing neurological conditions.\n\n**Your Epilepsy & the J&J Vaccine \u2013 What to Consider**\n\n* **Mild Epilepsy History:** You state your epilepsy is mild and has only occurred 4 times in six years, and generally your diagnosis is good. This is important.  The risk of a serious reaction to the vaccine triggering a significant epileptic event is considered very low.\n* **Potential for Immune System Activation:** Vaccines, by design, stimulate the immune system.  In some individuals with autoimmune conditions (and GBS *is* an autoimmune condition), this immune stimulation *could* theoretically worsen the underlying condition or trigger a flare-up. This is the core of the concern.\n* **Benefit vs. Risk:**  You must weigh the small risk of a potential neurological complication from the vaccine against the *much* larger risk of severe COVID-19 illness, hospitalization, long-COVID, and even death if you remain unvaccinated. COVID-19 itself can have neurological consequences, including seizures.\n\n\n\n**AstraZeneca Vaccine \u2013 Is it a Better Option?**\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine also had, early on, a very rare link to TTS. However, the risk appears to be *slightly* lower than with J&J, and the profiles of the illnesses are a little different. \n\n* **AstraZeneca & TTS:** Like J&J, AstraZeneca was linked to TTS, but the overall incidence was also very low, and the messaging around risk has evolved as more data became available.\n* **AstraZeneca and GBS:** There has been some signal for a slightly increased risk of GBS with AstraZeneca as well. However, the risk is still considered very small.\n\n**For someone with mild, well-controlled epilepsy, the AstraZeneca vaccine is generally considered a reasonable alternative, and in some cases, preferred.** Many guidelines now recommend preferential use of mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna, if available) but if those aren't options, AstraZeneca is often the next best choice.\n\n\n**Specific Recommendations (Given You Can't Reach Your Doctor *Immediately*)**\n\n1. **Prioritize mRNA Vaccines (If Available):**  If Pfizer or Moderna are available to you, *those are generally the preferred options* for someone with your medical history. They have a different mechanism of action and haven't been linked to the same neurological concerns as J&J or AstraZeneca.\n2. **If mRNA Vaccines Aren't Available:  AstraZeneca is likely a reasonable choice:**  Given your limited epilepsy history, AstraZeneca would generally be considered a safer alternative to J&J.\n3. **Get Vaccinated!** The risks of COVID-19 itself are significantly greater than the very rare risks associated with any of the vaccines.  \n4. **As Soon As Possible: Consult Your Doctor:**  This is the most important step.  You *need* to discuss this with your neurologist or primary care physician. They can assess your individual risk factors, the local COVID-19 situation, and provide personalized advice.  Explain your concerns and ask them specifically which vaccine they recommend for you.\n5. **Monitor for Symptoms:**  After vaccination (with any vaccine), be vigilant for any unusual neurological symptoms \u2013 weakness, tingling, dizziness, vision changes, seizures \u2013 and report them to a doctor immediately.\n\n\n\n**Resources to Share with Your Doctor (When You Can Connect)**\n\n*   **CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention):**  [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/janssen.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/janssen.html) and [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/astrazeneca.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/astrazeneca.html)\n*   **WHO (World Health Organization):** [https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety)\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I am 14, Male I was diagnosed with Photosensitive Epilepsy at a young age if that helps.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, thank you for sharing that important information! Being diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy at a young age significantly influences what advice is appropriate. It's *very* good you're telling me this upfront, as flashing lights and certain visual patterns can trigger seizures for people with this condition.  This will be a major consideration in everything we discuss.\n\nLet's talk about your interest in game development. It's awesome you're pursuing this! It *is* absolutely possible to get into game development with photosensitive epilepsy, but it does require being very aware and proactive about managing potential triggers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how your epilepsy impacts game dev, and what steps you can take, divided into sections.  It's long, but thorough.  **Please read the Disclaimer at the very end!**\n\n**1. Understanding the Risks in Game Development**\n\n* **Flashing Lights:** This is the most obvious and well-known trigger.  Games often use these for effects like explosions, magic, or rapid transitions.\n* **Rapid Patterns:** Highly contrasting, rapidly changing patterns (like stripes, checkerboards, grids) can also be problematic.  Think of repeating textures at high speed.\n* **Strobe Effects:** Similar to flashing lights, but more focused and rhythmic.\n* **High Contrast Transitions:** Sudden shifts from very bright to very dark or vice-versa can trigger seizures.\n* **Camera Movement:**  Fast, jerky camera movements, especially combined with visual effects, can be a trigger, even without explicit flashing.\n* **Screenspace Effects (Bloom, Distortion):** While not always direct triggers, intense bloom or distortion effects can increase visual \"busyness\" and potentially contribute.\n* **Specific Colors:** Some individuals are sensitive to particular color combinations or frequencies.\n* **3D Effects:** Certain 3D rendering techniques or specific scenes can be problematic.\n\n\n\n**2. Game Development Roles \u2013 Risk Level Assessment**\n\nLet\u2019s look at different areas of game development and how they relate to your condition, from highest to lowest risk:\n\n* **High Risk:**\n    * **Visual Effects (VFX) Artist:** This role *directly* involves creating flashing lights, explosions, and other potentially triggering visual elements.  This would be the most challenging path.\n    * **Shader Developer:**  Shaders control how surfaces look, and complex shaders can create rapidly changing visuals.\n    * **Technical Artist (focused on lighting/effects):** Similar to VFX, this role is heavily involved in visual aspects.\n* **Medium Risk:**\n    * **Level Designer:**  You control the environment, including lighting and placement of visual effects.  You'd need to be very careful about how you use these elements.\n    * **Animator:**  While animation itself isn't *always* triggering, fast-paced, dynamic animations can be.\n    * **Environment Artist:**  Creating the look of the game world. Less *direct* control over effects, but if you handle lighting within the environment, there's a risk.\n    * **UI/UX Designer:** User Interface design can sometimes involve animations and rapid changes.\n* **Lower Risk:**\n    * **Game Programmer (Gameplay/AI):** Writing the code that makes the game *function* (movement, interactions, etc.).  This is generally less visually focused.\n    * **Game Programmer (Engine):** Working on the core engine that powers the game. Even less visual focus.\n    * **Sound Designer:** Creating audio for the game.\n    * **Game Writer/Narrative Designer:** Storytelling and writing dialogue.\n    * **Game Producer/Project Manager:**  Overseeing the development process; minimal visual work.\n    * **Game Tester (with modifications - see section 4)**\n\n\n\n\n**3. Strategies for Managing Risks & Making Game Development Accessible**\n\nThese are things *you* can do:\n\n* **Be Open About Your Condition:**  This is crucial.  Tell your instructors (if you're in school), potential mentors, and, if you work on a team, your teammates.  Good teams will be understanding and willing to accommodate your needs.\n* **Focus on Lower-Risk Roles:**  As mentioned above, strongly consider roles like game programmer (gameplay, AI, or engine), sound designer, game writer, or project management.  These allow you to contribute significantly without being directly responsible for triggering visuals.\n* **Develop preventative measures in your workflow:**\n    * **Use a dimmer:**  Reduce the overall brightness of your screen.\n    * **Use a Blue Light Filter:** Reduces the intensity of blue light, which can be easier on the eyes and potentially reduce risk.\n    * **Take Frequent Breaks:**  Look away from the screen regularly.  The 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n    * **Work in a Well-Lit Room:** This reduces contrast and eye strain.\n    * **Avoid Working When Tired or Stressed:** Fatigue and stress can lower your seizure threshold.\n* **Learn to Identify Triggers:**  Pay close attention to *exactly* what elements cause you discomfort.  Is it flashing white? Rapid stripes?  Knowing your specific sensitivities is vital.\n* **Advocate for Accessible Design:** As you get more experienced, you can advocate for designing games with photosensitivity in mind (see section 5).\n\n\n\n**4. Game Testing & Playtesting**\n\n* **Testing is potentially risky.** Being exposed to triggering content while testing is a real concern.\n* **Limited Exposure:** If you want to test, start with **very short** play sessions, and only on games you've researched to be relatively safe.\n* **Modifications:**  \n    * **Play with effects turned down or off:** Many games have settings to adjust visual effects.\n    * **Play in a controlled environment:**  Well-lit room, with someone else present.\n    * **Have an \"emergency stop\" plan:**  Know how to quickly close the game or turn off the screen if you feel uncomfortable.\n* **Consider non-visual testing:** Focus on gameplay, bug finding, or narrative aspects that don\u2019t require extended visual exposure.\n\n\n\n**5. Contributing to Accessible Game Design (Long-Term Goal)**\n\nThis is where you can *really* make a difference! As you learn, you can become an advocate for designing games that are more inclusive of people with photosensitive epilepsy:\n\n* **Flashing Light Warnings:** Implement clear warnings before sections with potentially triggering effects.\n* **Adjustable Effects:** Allow players to completely disable or significantly reduce flashing lights, strobing, and other problematic visuals.  This is becoming more common, and you can push for it!\n* **Colorblind Modes:** Often, colorblind modes can also help reduce the intensity of certain color combinations.\n* **Pattern Reduction:**  Avoid the use of excessively busy or rapidly changing patterns.\n* **Alternative Visual Cues:**  Use sound, haptic feedback, or other methods to convey information instead of relying solely on flashing lights.\n* **Research is important:** Keep up to date with best practices and guidelines for accessible game design.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **Gaming & Epilepsy:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/epilepsy-and-video-games](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/epilepsy-and-video-games)\n* **AbleGamers:** [https://ablegamers.org/](https://ablegamers.org/) (Focuses on game accessibility)\n\n\n\n**To help me tailor further advice to you, could you tell me:**\n\n* **What specifically interests you about game development?** (e.g., programming, art, storytelling, design)\n* **Are you currently taking any classes or doing any learning on your own?**  If so, what?\n* **What game engines are you interested in learning?** (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine, GameMaker Studio 2)\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I\u2019m (19M) 6 foot 2, 74kg. I\u2019m on clobasam and tegratol for my epilepsy . Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time. This means I often have between 5-7 standards and on rare occasions above 10.I drink as much as the night entails but am just realising that I could have just been lucky all these times. This is a question I have always want answered and one that doctors always avoid answering or don\u2019t fully answer.So my question is: are some epileptics able to drink as much as any other person and be fine and could I be one of those people OR have I just been lucky all this time and do I need to make some changes?It\u2019s been frustratingly hard to get a straight answer on this dilemma anywhere and it just occurred to me now that I could ask reddit! All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *really* important question, and I understand your frustration with getting clear answers from doctors. You're right to be thinking about this carefully, and you're smart to question the situation and seek more info.  Let's break this down.  I'm going to give you a thorough response, but **please read the disclaimer at the very end.** I am *not* a doctor. This is information, not medical advice.\n\n**First: Why Doctors Are Hesitant - and Why Their Caution Is Justified**\n\nYour doctor's recommendation of 2 standard drinks is a very common and conservative one for people with epilepsy. Here's why:\n\n* **Medication Interactions:** Both clobazam and carbamazepine (Tegretol) can interact with alcohol.  These interactions can be complex.\n    * **Enhanced Sedation:** Both drugs *and* alcohol are central nervous system depressants. Combining them significantly increases drowsiness, impairs coordination, and can increase your risk of falling (which itself could trigger a seizure).\n    * **Altered Medication Metabolism:** Alcohol can affect how your body metabolizes (breaks down) your epilepsy medications. This can lead to either higher levels of the drugs in your system (increasing side effects) or lower levels (increasing seizure risk).\n    * **Lowered Seizure Threshold:** Alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can disrupt sleep architecture.  Given your nocturnal epilepsy and sleepwalking, this is *especially* concerning.  Disrupted sleep is a known trigger for seizures in many people with epilepsy.  Alcohol itself can also directly lower the seizure threshold.\n* **Individual Variability:** Everyone reacts differently to alcohol, and that's even *more* true for people with epilepsy. Factors like genetics, liver function, hydration, food intake, and even stress levels can play a role.\n* **Liability:** Doctors are understandably cautious about giving any advice that could be construed as allowing a patient to engage in risky behavior. It's easier (legally and professionally) to be conservative.\n\n**Now, to Your Question: Can Some Epileptics Drink \"Normally\"?**\n\nThe short answer is\u2026 *possibly*. But it's incredibly complex and requires careful consideration. Here's a detailed look:\n\n* **Well-Controlled Epilepsy:** If your seizures are *completely* controlled by medication for a long period (often years \u2013 typically 2+ seizure free years is a benchmark) *and* you have no other seizure triggers, *some* doctors *might* be more lenient.  But even then, they'll emphasize moderation.\n* **Type of Epilepsy:** Your nocturnal epilepsy complicates things.  As mentioned earlier, alcohol\u2019s impact on sleep is a significant risk factor for this type.  Some epilepsy syndromes are more sensitive to alcohol than others.\n* **Medication Specifics:**  Clobazam and Carbamazepine are both considered a bit more problematic with alcohol than some newer anti-epileptic drugs.\n* **Individual Tolerance:**  You've experienced that you \"feel fine\" after drinking more than the recommended amount.  This *doesn't* mean you're not at risk. It means you haven\u2019t *noticeably* experienced a negative outcome yet.  A seizure could still occur, even without obvious outward signs of intoxication. It's also possible that alcohol is subtly affecting your sleep and increasing your seizure risk without you realizing it.\n* **The \"Luck\" Factor:** You may have been lucky so far. It's entirely plausible. Statistical likelihood doesn\u2019t negate risk. You're essentially gambling with your neurological health.\n\n**Why Your Approach of Gradually Increasing Intake Is Problematic**\n\nWhile your approach *seems* logical (gradually testing your limits), it's a flawed experiment for several reasons:\n\n* **Non-Linear Effects:**  The relationship between alcohol and seizure risk isn't linear.  Meaning, going from 2 to 3 drinks might be okay, but going from 5 to 6 could push you over a critical threshold.\n* **Hidden Effects:** Alcohol can affect seizure control *without* causing noticeable intoxication. \n* **Sleep Disruption:** Even if you don't *feel* drunk, alcohol disrupts sleep, potentially triggering nocturnal seizures.\n* **You're the Experiment:** You're risking your health to gather data. That's not ethically sound.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do**\n\n1. **Honest Conversation with Your Neurologist:** This is crucial.  You need to have a *very* open and honest discussion with the doctor who manages your epilepsy. Tell them exactly what you\u2019ve been doing. Don't downplay it.  Frame it not as defiance, but as a desire to understand your individual risk.  Prepare specific questions \u2013  \"Given my epilepsy type, medications, and seizure control, what is my actual risk of a seizure at different levels of alcohol consumption?\"  \"Are there any tests we can do to assess my individual tolerance?\" \"What are the potential long-term effects of regular alcohol use on my epilepsy?\"\n2. **Consider a Sleep Study:**  Given your nocturnal epilepsy, a sleep study while monitoring brain activity could potentially reveal how alcohol affects your sleep architecture and seizure risk.\n3. **Be Prepared to Scale Back:**  The most likely outcome of a productive conversation with your neurologist is a recommendation to reduce your alcohol intake significantly or abstain entirely. Accepting and following that advice is the safest course of action.\n4. **Understand Your Triggers:** Even if you find some level of alcohol consumption is okay, identify and avoid other seizure triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, flashing lights, etc.).\n5. **Consider a Second Opinion:** If you feel your neurologist isn't listening or providing helpful guidance, seek a second opinion from another epileptologist.\n\n\n\n**In conclusion:** While it *might* be possible for some people with well-controlled epilepsy to consume alcohol in moderate amounts, your situation (nocturnal epilepsy, specific medications) makes it considerably riskier. Your current consumption level (5-7+ drinks) is almost certainly beyond what's safe.  Don't rely on \"feeling fine\" as a measure of safety.  The potential consequences are too serious.\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-experimentation with alcohol while having epilepsy is dangerous and potentially life-threatening.  The information provided here should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n\n\nI really hope this helps, and I wish you the best in getting the answers you need.  It\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking this seriously."

        "question": "21F. I pretty much have generalized hyperhidrosis but the sweating in my feet, hands, and underarms are what bother me the most. I\u2019ve been looking into Iontophoresis but read that people with epilepsy might not be able to use this treatment. Anyone know anything about this? Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're right to be cautious and research this! You're smart to consider how hyperhidrosis treatment might interact with your epilepsy. Here's a breakdown of the information regarding iontophoresis and epilepsy, pulling from medical literature and expert sources.  I will also add a **disclaimer at the end** because I am an AI and cannot offer medical advice.\n\n**The Connection: Why the Concern?**\n\nThe main concern with iontophoresis and epilepsy stems from the *small electrical current* used in the treatment. Here's why it raises a flag:\n\n* **Potential for Seizure Trigger:**  Electrical stimulation, even at low levels, *can* theoretically lower the seizure threshold in some individuals with epilepsy. This means it could make a seizure more likely to occur.\n* **Brain Stimulation:** While iontophoresis for hyperhidrosis focuses on extremities (hands and feet), there\u2019s a theoretical risk, especially with improper technique or overly high current settings, of some degree of electrical influence reaching the nervous system.\n* **Individual Variability:** People with epilepsy have *very* different seizure thresholds and sensitivities. What might be safe for one person could be problematic for another.\n\n\n\n**What the Medical Literature Says (It's mixed, but leans cautious):**\n\n* **Limited Studies:** There's a surprising *lack* of robust, large-scale studies specifically investigating iontophoresis safety in people with epilepsy.  Most information is based on case reports, expert opinion, and understanding of electrophysiology.\n* **Case Reports & Anecdotal Evidence:**  A few case reports have described seizures occurring *during* or *after* iontophoresis treatment in patients with epilepsy. However, it\u2019s often difficult to definitively prove causation \u2013 was it the iontophoresis, or would the seizure have happened anyway?\n* **General Recommendations (From Dermatologists & Neurologists):**\n    * **Neurologist Consultation is *Essential*:**  The vast majority of experts agree that anyone with epilepsy considering iontophoresis *must* first be evaluated by their neurologist. This is non-negotiable.\n    * **Risk Assessment:** The neurologist will assess your:\n        * **Type of Epilepsy:**  Some epilepsy syndromes are more sensitive to stimuli than others.\n        * **Seizure Control:**  How well-controlled are your seizures?  If you're seizure-free on medication for a long time, the risk may be lower (but still present).  If you have frequent, poorly controlled seizures, the risk is higher.\n        * **Medications:** Some anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) might interact or affect your sensitivity.\n        * **Overall Health:** Other medical conditions can impact seizure risk.\n    * **If Considered Safe:**  If your neurologist determines iontophoresis *might* be okay, they will likely recommend:\n        * **Starting with Very Low Current:**  Begin with the lowest possible current setting and gradually increase it *only* under very close supervision by a trained professional (dermatologist or technician).\n        * **Close Monitoring:**  During the treatment, you should be closely monitored for any signs of neurological changes or seizure activity.\n        * **Avoid Head/Neck Area:**  Iontophoresis should *never* be used on the head or neck in someone with epilepsy. This minimizes the chance of current affecting the brain directly.\n        * **Awareness of Symptoms:** Be educated about potential warning signs of a seizure and know to immediately stop the treatment and seek help if anything unusual occurs.\n\n**Alternatives to Iontophoresis (To Discuss with Your Doctor)**\n\nIf iontophoresis is deemed too risky, or you\u2019re uncomfortable with even a small risk, explore these alternatives with your doctor:\n\n* **Topical Anticholinergics:**  (e.g., glycopyrrolate). These medications reduce sweating, but can have side effects like dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation.\n* **Oral Medications:**  Other oral medications are available, but often have more significant side effects.\n* **Botox Injections:**  Botulinum toxin (Botox) can be injected into the armpits to block nerve signals that trigger sweating.  This is effective, but temporary (typically lasts 6-12 months) and can be expensive.\n* **Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy (ETS):** This is a surgical procedure that cuts the nerves responsible for sweating in the armpits.  It's generally considered a last resort due to potential complications (including compensatory sweating \u2013 sweating in other areas of the body).\n* **Microwave Thermolysis (MiraDry):** A non-invasive procedure that uses microwave energy to destroy sweat glands in the armpits.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **International Hyperhidrosis Society:** [https://www.sweating.com/](https://www.sweating.com/) (Good info on hyperhidrosis and treatments, but always verify with your doctor.)\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) (Information on epilepsy and seizures)\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and *cannot* provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional (specifically your neurologist and a dermatologist experienced in hyperhidrosis treatment) for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  They can properly assess your individual risks and benefits and guide you towards the safest and most appropriate course of action.  Do not start or stop any treatment without their approval.\n\n\n\n**To help me give you the *most* relevant information, could you tell me:**\n\n* **What type of epilepsy do you have?** (If you are comfortable sharing.)\n* **How well controlled are your seizures?** (e.g., seizure-free for X years, occasional breakthrough seizures, frequent seizures)\n* **What medications are you currently taking?** (Again, only if comfortable sharing; I understand privacy concerns.)\n\n\n\nI hope this comprehensive response is helpful!

        "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions. I thought i'd come prepared this year to ask more, but with the outbreak our meeting was postponed.TL;DR : does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time ? are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, you're right to be proactive and concerned about the long-term implications of epilepsy. It's frustrating your doctor wasn't more forthcoming with information. Let's break down your questions and give you a comprehensive overview, keeping in mind I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice \u2013 this is for informational purposes only, and you *need* to discuss this with a neurologist.\n\n**1. Does Epilepsy Increase the Risk of Brain-Related Diseases with Time?**\n\nThis is a complex question. The answer is *sometimes*, and it depends on a *lot* of factors. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Type of Epilepsy:**  Different epilepsy syndromes carry different risks.  The fact that your doctor described yours as a relatively rare one (12.5% of all epilepsies) and \"we don't know why\" is important. The underlying cause of the epilepsy, even if unknown, plays a role. Some genetic epilepsies have associated risks.  Structural abnormalities (like the anomaly you mentioned) *could* potentially contribute to other neurological issues over time, but again, it depends on the nature of that anomaly.\n* **Seizure Frequency & Severity:**  This is the biggest factor you can influence.  *Frequent repeated seizures* (especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures - the \"full blown\" kind) are linked to a slightly increased risk of:\n    * **Cognitive Decline:**  Over decades, frequent seizures *can* contribute to subtle difficulties with memory, attention, and executive function. This isn\u2019t inevitable, and good seizure control is very protective.\n    * **Hippocampal Sclerosis:**  This is a scarring of the hippocampus (important for memory) and is seen more often in people with temporal lobe epilepsy and frequent seizures.  (Whether this applies to your type is unknown without knowing its characteristics.)\n    * **Increased Risk of Dementia:** While not a direct cause-and-effect, prolonged, poorly controlled epilepsy may subtly increase the risk of developing dementia later in life. \n* **Medication Effects:**  AEDs (anti-epileptic drugs) themselves can have long-term effects, though these are also improving with newer medications. Some AEDs can contribute to bone density loss, or have subtle effects on mood or cognition.\n* **Comorbidities:** Having other health conditions (like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or depression \u2013 which are sometimes more common in people with epilepsy) can also influence brain health.\n* **Status Epilepticus:**  Prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) are particularly damaging and greatly increase risks. You haven\u2019t described this, and that\u2019s good.\n\n**2. Are Seizures and Partial Seizures Bad for the Brain and Should Be Avoided at All Cost?**\n\nYes, *any* seizure activity is generally undesirable for the brain. However, the level of \"bad\" varies greatly:\n\n* **Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (Grand Mal):** These are the most disruptive and potentially harmful. They involve the whole brain and carry the highest risk of injury (from falling, etc.).  These are the ones you *definitely* want to avoid.\n* **Partial Seizures (Auras, Focal Seizures):** You're experiencing these \"part seizures\" and seem to have identified triggers. While *not* harmless, they are generally considered less immediately damaging than generalized seizures, *especially* if they are brief and infrequent. However, *repeated* partial seizures *can* still contribute to subtle changes in brain function over time.  And they can sometimes evolve into generalized seizures.  The fact that they \"whip you back on track\" suggests you have good awareness and coping mechanisms.\n* **Subclinical Seizures:** These are seizures happening in the brain without outward signs. They are difficult to detect but *can* still have some impact.\n* **The Cumulative Effect:** It's not about a single seizure; it's about the *total* amount of seizure activity over a lifetime.  That's why minimizing *all* seizures is important.\n\n**Regarding your experiences:**\n\n* **The Last Seizure:** The fact that this one resulted in memory loss is concerning. It suggests it was more significant than your previous ones. It absolutely warrants further investigation and a discussion (which we\u2019ll get to).\n* **Your '3 Rules':**  You\u2019ve done fantastic work figuring out your triggers!  Sleep, medication adherence, and stress management are crucial for *anyone* with epilepsy, and you've clearly demonstrated that understanding your body is key. Those aren't just good for preventing seizures; they're just good for brain health in general.\n\n\n\n**What to Do (Especially Given Your Doctor\u2019s Lack of Communication)**\n\n1. **Second Opinion:**  Seriously consider getting a second opinion from another neurologist, ideally one specializing in epilepsy. Explain your concerns *and* the fact that your current doctor dismissed your questions. A good neurologist will welcome your questions and take your concerns seriously.\n2. **Prepare a Detailed List:**  Before your next appointment (with either your current doctor or a specialist), write down *everything*:\n    * **All Seizure Details:** Dates, times, what happened before, during, and after (even the partial seizures).  Be as specific as possible.\n    * **Medication List:**  Exact dosages and timing.\n    * **Triggers:**  Your sleep/meds/stress rule set.\n    * **Questions:** (See below)\n3. **Specific Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n    * \"What is the specific type of epilepsy I have been diagnosed with?\" A more precise diagnosis can give you more information about potential long-term risks.\n    * \"What is the nature of the anomaly in my brain, and what are the potential implications of that anomaly over time?\"\n    * \"What is the potential for cognitive decline or other neurological issues related to my epilepsy?\"\n    * \"What steps can I take *now* to protect my brain health in the long term?\" (e.g., lifestyle modifications, strict seizure control).\n    * \"What are the side effects of my current medications, and are there alternative medications with a better long-term safety profile?\"\n    * \u201cWhat is involved in ongoing monitoring of my brain health (e.g. MRI scans)? How frequently should I have these?\u201d\n    * \"If my partial seizures are well-controlled with my current lifestyle, is it still important to pursue further investigation into the underlying cause?\"\n4. **Advocate for Yourself:**  You have a right to understand your condition and receive clear, respectful communication.  If your doctor continues to dismiss your concerns, you *need* to find a doctor who will listen.\n5. **Epilepsy Foundation:**  Contact the Epilepsy Foundation ([https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)).  They have excellent resources, support groups, and may be able to help you find a specialist.\n\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by being proactive about your health. While epilepsy *can* be associated with an increased risk of brain-related issues over time, diligent management, including strict seizure control, lifestyle adjustments, and good communication with your medical team, can significantly mitigate those risks. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek the information you need to feel confident in your care.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "31 yrs old Male United States I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with flashing lights, so I\u2019m going on to get a sleep deprived EEG in two weeks.While I wait it over, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a lot of times in my life where I don\u2019t always pay attention, have a staring spell and/or feel like I\u2019m spacing off or thinking of something else.For example, people sometimes talk to me or I\u2019m not paying attention and when they ask me a question I say \u201cwhat\u201d even though I can recall what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m wondering if this is me just not paying attention or having an absent seizure.Other times I\u2019m stuck in a staring spell state (no more than 15-30 seconds) and it feels good, and then my wife interrupts me and she says I say \u201cwhy did you do that, I was stuck in a good stare\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very thoughtful and valid concern given your history of visual disturbances and now the upcoming EEG. You're right to be proactive and think about this, and you're also smart to recognize the anxiety around it. Let's break down your concerns.  I'll give you a lot of information, but *please read the disclaimer at the end* as I am not a doctor and cannot provide medical diagnoses.\n\n**Understanding Your Concerns**\n\nYou're describing a cluster of experiences:\n\n*   **\"Zoning out\" / Inattention:**  Saying \"what?\" even though you can repeat what was said is very common.\n*   **Staring Spells:** These 15-30 second periods of feeling \"stuck\" with a pleasant sensation are what's most concerning.\n*   **Flashing Lights Sensitivity:**  This is a key piece of the puzzle and a reason the EEG is being done.\n*   **Late-Onset Epilepsy Question:** The uncertainty of having lived 31 years without a *major* seizure.\n\n**Are these things normal? Can people without epilepsy experience them?**\n\nAbsolutely.  Many, *many* people experience brief periods of inattention, daydreaming, or feeling \"lost in thought\" throughout the day.  Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n*   **Inattention/Saying \"What?\":**  This is *incredibly* common.  It can be due to:\n    *   **Divided Attention:**  Thinking about something else while someone is speaking.\n    *   **Cognitive Load:**  Being mentally tired or overwhelmed.\n    *   **Subtle Hearing Issues:**  (Less likely if you can repeat what's said, but worth considering).\n    *   **Simply not focusing:** It sounds simplistic, but sometimes we just aren\u2019t actively listening.\n*   **Brief Staring Spells:** Also surprisingly common. These can be:\n    *   **Daydreaming:**  A particularly immersive daydream.\n    *   **Mind Wandering:**  Your thoughts drift, and you become unaware of your surroundings for a moment.\n    *   **Sensory Overload:**  Sometimes, our brains \"check out\" briefly when overwhelmed by stimuli.\n    *  **Microsleeps**: Very brief lapses in consciousness, often occurring when tired.\n\n**How does this relate to potential absent seizures?**\n\nYou're right to consider absent seizures (also called complex partial seizures).  They *can* present with staring spells. However, there are subtle differences that a professional needs to evaluate:\n\n*   **Duration:**  Absent seizures usually last 5-20 seconds. You're within that range.\n*   **Automatisms:** These are repetitive, involuntary movements during a seizure.  This could be lip smacking, chewing, hand movements, blinking, or subtle facial twitches. *You don\u2019t mention these, which is a point in favor of it potentially not being a seizure.*\n*   **Post-ictal State:**  A brief period of confusion or disorientation *after* the seizure.  You don't describe this.\n*   **Frequency:** How often do these spells occur?  Are they random, or are they triggered by specific things (like flashing lights, stress, etc.)?\n*    **Aura:**  Some people experience a warning sign (an aura) before a seizure, like a strange feeling, smell, or visual disturbance.\n\n*The fact that you experience a *pleasant* sensation during these spells is somewhat less typical of classic absent seizures, but doesn't rule it out.*\n\n**Late-Onset Epilepsy \u2013 Is it possible?**\n\nYes, it's absolutely possible to develop epilepsy at any age, including your 30s. However, it's less common to have a first seizure *without* any prior subtle seizure activity. That's why your symptoms are being investigated.\n\n*   **Genetic Predisposition:**  Sometimes, epilepsy has a genetic component that doesn't manifest until later in life.\n*   **Brain Injury:**  Even a mild head injury years ago could potentially contribute. (You haven\u2019t mentioned this.)\n*   **Stroke or Brain Tumor:**  These are less common causes, but need to be considered.\n*   **Idiopathic Epilepsy:** Sometimes there's no identifiable cause.\n\n**Flashing Lights & Photosensitivity:** This is strongly suggestive of potential seizure activity. Many forms of epilepsy have a photosensitivity component, meaning flashing lights can trigger a seizure. This is why the EEG is especially important, and they will likely be using a strobe light during the test.\n\n**What to do while you wait for the EEG:**\n\n1.  **Keep a Detailed Diary:** This is *crucial*.  Record every episode of \"zoning out\" or staring. Include:\n    *   **Date and Time**\n    *   **Duration (estimate)**\n    *   **What were you doing?** (e.g., reading, watching TV, driving, talking to someone)\n    *   **What was happening around you?** (e.g., bright lights, loud noises, stress)\n    *   **How did it feel?** (Describe the pleasant sensation, or if it was just a \u201cblank\u201d feeling)\n    *   **Were there any movements?** (even subtle ones)\n    *   **What happened immediately after?** (Were you confused? Did you continue what you were doing?)\n2. **Limit Exposure to Flashing Lights:**  As much as possible, avoid situations with strobe lights, rapidly changing patterns, or flickering screens.\n3. **Reduce Stress:**  Stress can sometimes exacerbate seizure activity.\n4.  **Good Sleep Hygiene:** Adequate sleep is important for overall brain health.\n5.  **Share this Diary with your Doctor:** This will be invaluable to them when interpreting the EEG results.\n6. **Don't Self-Diagnose**: I know it's tempting!\n\n\n\n**The EEG:**\n\nThe sleep-deprived EEG is a good choice.  Sleep deprivation can make seizure activity more pronounced, increasing the chance of detection.  Be sure to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully regarding medication and food restrictions before the test.\n\n\n\n**Most Importantly:**\n\nYou are doing the right thing by getting this checked out. The EEG will provide valuable information.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

Good luck! Let me know if you have more questions, though I will always reiterate my inability to give medical diagnoses."

        "question": "Hi. Over several months I (20f) have been feeling tired very easily. My family say I\u2019ve lost weight - I\u2019ve always had a low appetite but I\u2019ve always done my best to make sure I\u2019m getting enough calories/work around my lack of appetite by eating high calorie food, snacking regularly, and I think I get enough or more calories daily. I\u2019m naturally pretty pale but my family say I\u2019m paler. I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot of good information! It's smart you're doing some research before your appointment, and it's good you're thinking about how this might connect to your epilepsy. Let's break down your results, potential connections, and how it might relate to your seizures.  I'll preface this with: **I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only, and you should always discuss your results and concerns with your doctor.**\n\n**Understanding Your Results**\n\n*   **Vitamin B12:**  398 ng/L (within the normal range) - This is good. No concerns here.\n*   **Folate (Serum):** 3.89 ug/L (Below the low reference limit) -  This is low.  Serum folate is a measure of folate in your blood *right now*. It can fluctuate a lot based on recent intake, so it doesn't always reflect long-term stores.\n*   **Ferritin:** 14.2 ug/L (Within the normal range, but on the lower end) - This is also low-ish. Ferritin is a measure of your *stored* iron.  A level of 14.2 ug/L is generally considered low enough to cause symptoms, even if it hasn't reached the level considered \"dangerously\" low. \n*   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** <4 mg/L (normal) - Your inflammation is normal. This is helpful as it suggests the low folate and ferritin aren\u2019t due to a chronic inflammatory condition.\n\n**How Folate and Ferritin Can Be Connected - Despite a \"Good\" Diet**\n\nYou're right to question this! You *sound* like you're eating a fairly nutrient-rich diet. Here are some reasons why these deficiencies might occur *despite* good food intake:\n\n*   **Absorption Issues:** This is a big one. Even if you are eating enough folate and iron, your body might not be absorbing it properly. This can be due to:\n    *   **Gut Health:** Any issues with your gut lining (like mild inflammation, gut dysbiosis - an imbalance of gut bacteria) can impair absorption.\n    *   **Coeliac Disease/Gluten Sensitivity:**  Even without classic digestive symptoms, these can cause subtle absorption problems.\n    *   **Other Malabsorption Syndromes:** Less common, but possible, are conditions that interfere with nutrient uptake.\n*   **Increased Demand:** Your body might need more folate and iron than usual.  This could be due to:\n    *   **Menstrual Loss:** You mention light periods, but even light periods still involve some iron loss.  \n    *   **Rapid Growth/Cell Turnover:** While you're past major growth spurts, your body is constantly renewing cells.\n*   **Medication Interference:** While Keppra isn't *typically* linked to ferritin reduction like some other anticonvulsants, it *can* have effects on nutrient metabolism or overall gut health in some individuals. It\u2019s good to discuss this with your neuro.\n*   **Subclinical/Hidden Blood Loss:** Small, ongoing blood loss you aren\u2019t aware of (e.g., from heavy periods you may not realize are heavy, or gastrointestinal issues) can lead to iron depletion.\n*   **Dietary Factors:** While generally good, consider:\n    *   **Folate:** Folate from food is not as easily absorbed as folic acid (the synthetic form in supplements and fortified foods).\n    *   **Iron:** While you eat meat, the *type* of iron in meat (heme iron) is better absorbed than the iron in plant-based foods (non-heme iron). Vitamin C helps with non-heme iron absorption, so it's good that you eat lots of fruits & veggies.\n*   **Genetic Predisposition:** Some people are genetically predisposed to being less efficient at absorbing or utilizing certain nutrients.\n\n\n\n**Could this affect your Epilepsy?**\n\nYes, it *potentially* could.  Here's how:\n\n*   **Folate & Seizure Threshold:** Some research suggests a link between folate deficiency and a lowered seizure threshold.  Meaning, it might make you more susceptible to seizures. This isn't a direct cause-and-effect, but it's something to investigate.\n*   **Iron & Brain Function:** Iron is crucial for brain development and function.  Iron deficiency can affect neurotransmitter synthesis and overall brain health. Low iron can contribute to fatigue and cognitive issues, which, in turn, could potentially affect seizure control (indirectly).\n*   **Medication Interaction:**  As mentioned, while Keppra isn\u2019t known to deplete iron, it\u2019s best to discuss the impact of the medication on these levels with your neurologist.\n\n\n\n**What Should You Ask Your Doctor?**\n\nHere\u2019s a helpful list:\n\n1.  **Further Investigation:**\n    *   \"Could we investigate *why* my folate and ferritin are low, despite my diet?\"\n    *   \"Should I be tested for malabsorption issues, like coeliac disease?\" (A simple blood test can screen for this).\n    *   \"Could you check my red blood cell folate level?\" This gives a better indication of long-term folate stores.\n2.  **Epilepsy Considerations:**\n    *   \"Could these low levels be affecting my epilepsy or seizure control?\"\n    *   \"Should I discuss this with my neurologist?\"  (This is definitely a good idea!)\n    *   \"Is it safe to supplement with folate and iron given my epilepsy and Keppra?\"\n3.  **Treatment Plan:**\n    *   \"What is the best way to address these deficiencies?  Should I take supplements, or can we focus on dietary changes?\" (Supplements should be tailored to *your* needs, as excessive iron can be harmful).\n    *  \"How often should I have my levels rechecked?\"\n\n\n\n**Regarding your pale complexion and fatigue:** Those are very common symptoms of both folate and iron deficiency. The extreme thirst could be related to the body trying to compensate for imbalances, although that is less directly linked.\n\n**To summarize**:  You\u2019re being proactive, which is excellent.  It's great you're eating a healthy diet, but the low levels suggest something is preventing you from fully utilizing those nutrients. Don\u2019t panic! It\u2019s usually something treatable.  A thorough investigation with your GP, potentially involving a referral to your neurologist, is the best course of action.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  Again, I'm an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *lot* to process, and you're right to be anxious and to research. It's good you're being proactive and asking questions.  Here's a breakdown of your concerns, addressing everything as thoroughly as possible, while keeping in mind I am an AI and *cannot* give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and a conversation starter for you and your son's medical team.  I'll structure this to mirror your questions.\n\n**First, a HUGE acknowledgement:** You're in shock.  Seeing your child have a seizure is terrifying, and finding out it might be epilepsy is a lot to absorb.  It\u2019s entirely reasonable to feel panicky and overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n**1. Abnormal EEG Hours After the Event & Ongoing EEGs**\n\n* **Why abnormal hours later?**  EEGs don't just show activity *during* a seizure. They show how the brain's electrical activity functions *in general*.  Post-ictal (after a seizure) EEG changes are VERY common. The brain is often in a \"rebooting\" phase, and this can manifest as slowing, spikes, or other abnormalities.  It doesn't necessarily mean the abnormality was present *before* the seizure, or will *always* be there.  It's a snapshot in time.\n* **Does he always have that sort of EEG?**  No. A single abnormal EEG doesn't define the picture.  That's why the longer video EEG is crucial.  They need to see his brain activity over a prolonged period, ideally when he's awake *and* asleep, to understand the pattern (or lack of pattern).  EEG activity can fluctuate - it can be normal one day and show abnormalities another.\n* **The fact that they diagnosed based on *one* abnormal EEG, even post-ictal, is a bit unusual.** Generally, you\u2019re right, a second event is preferred, but a significantly abnormal EEG can push them to treat, especially if it\u2019s suggestive of a specific epilepsy syndrome.\n\n\n\n**2. EEG & Growth/Development**\n\n* **Could this abnormality have affected his growth/mental development?** It's *unlikely* that a single seizure and one abnormal EEG have caused any lasting developmental impact.  However, *uncontrolled* seizures over a long period *can* have developmental consequences.  The fact they're proactively treating it suggests they're trying to prevent that. It also helps to remember that he\u2019s 9, and his brain is still developing \u2013 so any intervention now is to help ensure normal development continues.\n* **Important:** If you have *any* concerns about changes in his behavior, learning, or overall development, *document them clearly* and discuss them with the neurologist.\n\n\n\n**3. Worry About Underlying Cause & MRI**\n\n* **Should we worry about an underlying cause?** Yes, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder. While the CT scan was clear (ruling out immediate structural problems), it's not as sensitive as an MRI. An MRI can detect more subtle abnormalities like small areas of scarring (cortical dysplasia), vascular malformations, or other lesions that might not cause symptoms themselves but could contribute to seizure activity.\n* **Should you get an MRI?** I think you should actively discuss this with the neurologist.  Your concern is valid.  Here's the argument for: *Peace of mind, and a more complete picture*. If an MRI is done and is normal, it significantly increases the confidence in the diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy. *If* something is found, it changes the treatment approach.  The neurologist's rationale for *not* doing an MRI needs to be clear to *you*. Is it that the EEG pattern is strongly suggestive of a type of epilepsy that rarely has a structural cause?\n* **Why might they be hesitant?** Sometimes, MRI findings don't change the management.  Finding a small, non-treatable lesion might cause anxiety without altering treatment. Also, MRIs require sedation in some children, which has its own risks.  \n\n\n\n**4. Realistically: Quality of Life on Depakote**\n\nThis is where real-world experience is crucial. *Everyone reacts differently to medication.*  Here's the honest breakdown, beyond the side effect list:\n\n* **Behavior changes:**  These are common, especially in the beginning. Depakote can cause irritability, mood swings, difficulty concentrating, and sometimes even depression. These *can* often be managed with dosage adjustments.  Expect to be a keen observer of his mood and behavior.\n* **Hair loss:** This is a possibility, but not everyone experiences it, and it\u2019s often mild.\n* **Liver toxicity:** This is a serious concern, but *regular blood tests* are used to monitor liver function.  The neurologist will be watching this very closely.  It's not a given, but it requires vigilance.\n* **Weight gain:**  Depakote can sometimes lead to weight gain.\n* **Other potential side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, tremors.\n\n* **Real experiences:** Many people live *full and active lives* on Depakote. The goal is to find the lowest effective dose to control the seizures while minimizing side effects. It takes time and adjustments.  There are support groups online (see resources below) where you can connect with other parents and individuals taking Depakote.\n\n**5. Can We Avoid Medication? CBD?**\n\n* **Avoiding medication:**  Your desire to avoid medication is understandable. However, *uncontrolled epilepsy is far more harmful to a developing brain than the potential side effects of medication, *when monitored properly*.  A single seizure doesn\u2019t mean he *will* have more, but sometimes they get worse over time.\n* **CBD:** While CBD has shown promise in some *specific* severe forms of epilepsy (like Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), its effectiveness for primary generalized epilepsy is less well-established.  It's not a substitute for standard medical care. It also comes with its own set of potential side effects and drug interactions.  *Do not* start CBD without discussing it thoroughly with the neurologist.  Legal CBD products vary wildly in quality and content.\n* **My Opinion:** I would not try to treat this with solely CBD without a very detailed discussion with your neurologist and an understanding of the risks and benefits.\n\n\n\n**6. Second/Third Opinion & Further EEGs**\n\n* **Yes, absolutely get a second opinion.**  Especially given your concerns about the MRI.  Find a pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy.\n* **What to bring:**  Bring *all* the records: ER report, EEG report, doctor's notes.  \n* **Show the EEG to other neurologists:** Yes, that's the most efficient way to get another perspective.\n* **Consider a 3rd opinion if you still feel uncertain after the 2nd.**\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) \u2013 Excellent information, support groups, and resources.\n* **Child Neurology Foundation:** [https://www.childneurologyfoundation.org/](https://www.childneurologyfoundation.org/)\n* **Facebook support groups:** Search for \"Epilepsy Parents\" or \"Depakote Support\" \u2013 be cautious about taking medical advice from Facebook, but it can be a good place to hear about others' experiences.\n\n**Key Takeaways & What to Do Now:**\n\n1. **Schedule:** Schedule that longer video EEG ASAP.\n2. **MRI:** Advocate for an MRI.  Ask the neurologist to explain *specifically* why they don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\n3. **Second Opinion:**  Get a second opinion from another pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy *before* continuing Depakote long-term.\n4. **Document:** Keep a detailed journal of any changes in your son's behavior, mood, or physical health.\n5. **Questions:** Write down all your questions before appointments and don't hesitate to ask them.\n6. **Trust your instincts:** You are your son\u2019s best advocate.\n\n\n\nI understand how frightening this is.  Take a deep breath.  You're doing the right thing by being informed and seeking answers.  Empower yourself with knowledge, surround yourself with a good medical team you trust, and advocate for your son's best interests.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a complex situation with a lot going on, and I understand why you're concerned. You've clearly had a frightening experience, and the history you've provided is important.  I am an AI and *cannot* provide medical advice.  This requires a qualified medical professional. However, I can offer a breakdown of why your experience warrants immediate medical attention and what things might be going on, given your history and recent events.  I'll then follow with *very strong* recommendations.\n\n**Let's break down the components and potential concerns:**\n\n* **Your Medical History:** This is significant.\n    * **Epilepsy History:** Even with a long remission, a history of epilepsy *always* makes new neurological events concerning.  The fact that your seizures appeared to correlate with the onset of menstruation is interesting and something a neurologist would want to know.  Hormonal fluctuations can sometimes influence seizure activity.\n    * **Barrett's Esophagus & Acid Reflux:** While not directly related to seizures, chronic GI distress can contribute to overall stress and potentially impact medication absorption.\n    * **IBS:**  Similar to Barrett's, contributes to overall stress level.\n    * **Anxiety & ADHD Medications:**  Both Buspar and Adderall can, in rare cases, have neurological side effects or interact in ways that potentially lower the seizure threshold (make seizures more likely).\n* **The Event (Day after work):** This is the core of your concern. The description *strongly* raises concern for a potential seizure, *even though* it didn't look like a \"typical\" convulsive seizure. Here's *why*:\n    * **\"Aura\" Feeling:** The deja vu sensation is a very common aura experienced by people with epilepsy *before* a seizure.\n    * **Temporary Paralysis/Unresponsiveness:**  Being unable to move, speak, or open your eyes for 20 seconds, while fully conscious, is *highly suggestive* of a seizure, particularly a focal seizure.  These can manifest in many ways. The inability to move is called paralysis.\n    * **Amplified Sounds & Vibratory Sensations:** These are not typical of sleep paralysis; they are *more* consistent with altered sensory perception during a seizure.  Sensory distortions are common in seizures.\n    * **Post-Ictal Exhaustion:** The extreme fatigue and grogginess you experienced afterward is often referred to as the \"post-ictal state\" and is very common after a seizure. It can last hours or even days.\n    * **Down Mood:** Post-ictal mood changes, including depression, are also common.\n* **Potential Triggering Factors (The Day Before):** These are important to analyze.\n    * **Adderall:** Stimulants can, in some individuals, lower the seizure threshold, particularly in those with a history of epilepsy.\n    * **Espresso/Caffeine:** Excessive caffeine intake is a known trigger for seizures in susceptible individuals.\n    * **Alcohol:** Alcohol can also lower the seizure threshold, especially with frequent or heavy use.  Even moderate alcohol consumption can interact with medications. The fact this was your third day at a job where you were regularly having alcohol is important.\n    * **Stress/Sleep Deprivation:** Working in a fast-paced environment like a dive bar, combined with potential sleep deprivation, significantly increases stress levels which can also potentially contribute.\n\n\n\n\n**Is this a Seizure?**\n\nBased on your description, it is **highly probable** that you experienced a focal seizure.  However, *only* a medical professional can make that determination.  The fact that it doesn't fit the \"classic\" convulsive seizure model does *not* rule it out.  Seizures are incredibly diverse in how they present.\n\n**What You *Must* Do \u2013 Urgent Recommendations:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATELY SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION:**  Do not wait. **Go to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care *today*.**  Explain your entire medical history, including the epilepsy, medications, and the specific details of what happened.  Tell them you are concerned you may have had a seizure.  *Do not drive yourself*.\n2. **Neurologist Consultation:** You *need* a referral to a neurologist.  If the ER or Urgent care doesn't initiate this, *insist* on one.  A neurologist will perform tests (likely an EEG \u2013 electroencephalogram \u2013 to measure brain activity, and potentially imaging like an MRI) to determine if you had a seizure, identify the type of seizure, and evaluate your epilepsy status.\n3. **Medication Review:**  Discuss all your medications (Buspar, Adderall, Omeprazole, Dicyclomine) with your doctor *and* the neurologist.  They need to assess for potential interactions or if any are contributing to the problem.\n4. **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n    * **Caffeine Reduction:** Significantly reduce or eliminate caffeine intake.\n    * **Alcohol Abstinence:**  Stop drinking alcohol completely, at least until you've been evaluated by a neurologist. This is crucial.\n    * **Stress Management:**  Explore stress reduction techniques (mindfulness, meditation, therapy).\n    * **Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize regular, sufficient sleep.\n5. **Document:** Start keeping a detailed log of your symptoms, medications, caffeine and alcohol intake, sleep patterns, and stress levels. This information will be invaluable to your doctors.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot, and understandably you're worried. You've been through a frightening experience, and the continued pain is adding another layer of stress. Let's break down the information you\u2019ve provided and discuss possible explanations, while *strongly emphasizing* that this is **not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation**. I will give you information to consider and help you understand what might be happening, but my advice is limited by the fact I am an AI and cannot examine you.  The lack of insurance *is* a major barrier, but we'll talk about approaches to potentially overcome that later.\n\n**First: The Accident & Your Seizure History**\n\nYou've done the right thing by finally getting on medication for your seizures. Three months seizure-free is *excellent* news. It's also crucial to get a formal diagnosis and treatment plan from a neurologist.  Your description of the seizures \u2013 dissociation, aura, deja vu, sensory distortions \u2013 strongly aligns with temporal lobe epilepsy, as you noted.  The fact you weren\u2019t aware of the seizure happening while driving is typical. It's good you're planning to seek neurological care when possible. \n\nThe accident itself is complicated by the seizure. It's likely the seizure *was* the direct cause of the car crash.  This is important legally (potentially impacting insurance/liability, which I won\u2019t delve into here) and medically.\n\n**Second: The Pain \u2013 What Could Be Going On?**\n\nYou're experiencing persistent left-sided, lower rib cage pain with pressure sensation around your heart and lung.  Here's a breakdown of the possibilities, ranging from more common/less serious to those requiring urgent investigation (even without immediate access to a doctor):\n\n* **Musculoskeletal Injury (Most Likely):**  This is the most probable cause, given your description. The impact, even at relatively low speed, combined with the tension/muscle spasms that often happen during and after a trauma (and possibly even during a seizure itself!) could have caused:\n    * **Rib Contusion (Bruising):** Even without visible bruising, a contusion to the ribs can be incredibly painful.  Pain can linger for weeks or even months.\n    * **Intercostal Muscle Strain:**  These are the muscles between your ribs.  They can get strained or torn during impact.\n    * **Costochondritis:** Inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone. Can cause sharp, localized pain.\n* **Pleurisy:** Inflammation of the lining around the lungs (the pleura). This causes sharp pain that *worsens with breathing*.  The fact you mention pressure around your lung raises this possibility. However, pleurisy often presents with a cough and fever (which you haven't mentioned).\n* **Lung Injury (Less Likely, but Requires Consideration):**\n    * **Pulmonary Contusion:** A bruise to the lung tissue.  This *can* happen even without a break in the skin.  Symptoms can include shortness of breath, pain with breathing, and coughing up blood (again, you haven't mentioned the latter, but keep an eye out).\n    * **Pneumothorax (Collapsed Lung):**  Air leaking into the space between the lung and chest wall. This is often associated with more significant trauma, but it can occur with rib fractures (even hairline fractures \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t always be obvious) or forceful impacts. Can lead to shortness of breath and sharp pain.\n* **Cardiac Involvement (Less Likely, but Needs Ruling Out):**  While you likely wouldn't be experiencing pain *directly* from your heart, pain originating elsewhere can *feel* like it's heart-related.  The pressure sensation is worth keeping in mind. This is especially crucial if you have any other risk factors for heart problems.\n* **Internal Organ Damage:** While less probable, it's always a consideration after trauma. Damage to the spleen or kidney (though typically more upper abdominal pain) should be thought of.\n\n**Regarding Your Current Treatments:**\n\n* **Anti-inflammatory Steroids:**  Good that you were prescribed these. They *can* help reduce inflammation and pain from musculoskeletal injuries. A 5-day course is relatively short, but it might provide some relief.\n* **Menthol Patches & Analgesic Cream:** These can offer symptomatic relief, but they don\u2019t address the underlying cause.  They're good for managing pain, but don't rely on them as a solution.\n\n\n\n**What Could You Do (Given Limited Resources)?**\n\nThis is the hard part.  You're right to be concerned, and not having insurance makes everything much harder:\n\n1. **Monitor Your Symptoms *Very Closely*:** This is crucial. Pay attention to:\n    * **Pain Level:** Is it increasing? Changing in character?\n    * **Breathing:**  Are you short of breath, even with minimal exertion? Is breathing painful?\n    * **Cough:**  Are you developing a cough?  Is there any blood in your sputum?\n    * **Fever:**  Take your temperature regularly.\n    * **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:**  Any new onset or worsening?\n    * **Pulse:** Check your pulse regularly. Is it abnormally fast or irregular?\n\n2. **Free/Low-Cost Clinics:**  Search for free or low-cost medical clinics in your area.  These are often run by hospitals, universities, or charitable organizations.  (Google \"free medical clinics [your city/county]\")\n3. **Hospital Financial Assistance:**  If you *need* to go to the ER, ask about financial assistance programs. Most hospitals offer some form of aid to patients without insurance. *Don't be afraid to ask!*  They often have social workers who can help you navigate the process.\n4. **Community Health Centers:** These centers provide comprehensive health care services on a sliding fee scale, meaning the cost is based on your income.\n5. **211 Helpline:**  In the US and Canada, dial 211 to connect with local health and human service programs.  They can often direct you to resources you didn't know existed.\n6. **GoodRx & Similar Apps:** These apps can help you find the lowest prices on prescription medications.\n7. **Consider Telehealth:** Though you need a diagnosis and likely imaging (X-ray), a telehealth visit *might* be helpful for a preliminary assessment and advice on when to seek emergency care. Promo codes for cheaper/free telehealth appointments can be found online.\n\n**When to Seek *Immediate* Medical Attention (ER):**\n\n* **Severe Shortness of Breath:**  Inability to breathe comfortably.\n* **Chest Pain:**  Especially if it's crushing, squeezing, or radiating to your arm or jaw. (Even if you think it's musculoskeletal, get it checked out.)\n* **Coughing Up Blood:** Even a small amount.\n* **Dizziness or Lightheadedness** -  especially if accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain.\n* **Severe Pain That Doesn't Respond to Medication:**\n* **Signs of Infection:** Fever, chills, increased redness or swelling around the injury site.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n\nI truly hope this helps, and that you're able to access the care you need.  Your health is important, and you deserve to get the answers and treatment you require. Please prioritize seeking medical attention if your symptoms worsen or if you develop any of the \"immediate attention\" warning signs I've listed.\n\n\n\n"

I have frontal lobe nocturnal tonic clinic epilepsy. What do you all think? Is this a good idea? Should I go for it? Or should I stick with just adding medication? I\u2019m 16 years old and I just want this gone. I\u2019m so sick and tired of the fear.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really big decision, and it's completely understandable to be terrified. You're dealing with a lot \u2013 a complex neurological condition, a lot of medications, and a desire to *finally* feel free from the constant fear of seizures. Let's break this down in a way that hopefully feels helpful, and I'll try to address your specific concerns.  I will preface this with the *very important disclaimer* at the end that I am an AI and *cannot* give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only and you *must* continue to work closely with your doctors.\n\n**Understanding Your Situation**\n\n* **Complex Medical History:** You have a significant medical history with multiple diagnoses \u2013 ADHD, frontal lobe nocturnal tonic clonic epilepsy, Asperger's, and generalized anxiety. It\u2019s great you already have a good understanding of that and are actively seeking solutions. These conditions can all interact with each other, and with your epilepsy.\n* **Medication List:** You're on a substantial amount of medication. This suggests your epilepsy hasn't been fully controlled by simpler regimens, and the addition of 5-HTP and melatonin highlights attempts to address other symptoms (sleep, mood) that likely are impacted by your epilepsy and/or other conditions.\n* **Frontal Lobe Epilepsy:** Frontal lobe epilepsy can be tricky. The frontal lobe controls a lot of important functions, and seizures can manifest in unusual ways. Nocturnal seizures are also more concerning because there's less opportunity for someone to notice and intervene.\n* **The Desire for a Cure:**  You're 16. You've been living with fear and limitations.  It\u2019s *completely* natural to want this *gone*.  That's a powerful motivating factor.\n\n\n\n**The Tests and the Possibility of Surgery**\n\nYour doctor is taking the right first step by suggesting further investigation. Here's what those tests are for:\n\n* **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** This provides detailed images of your brain, looking for structural abnormalities like lesions, tumors, or malformations of blood vessels that might be causing the seizures. It\u2019s a standard, relatively safe imaging technique.\n* **CT Scan (Computed Tomography):**  This uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the brain. It's quicker than an MRI and can be useful for detecting things an MRI might miss, particularly bone abnormalities or acute bleeding. It involves some radiation exposure.\n* **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography):** This is the *most* important test in this context. A PET scan measures brain activity. By injecting a radioactive tracer, it can pinpoint the *exact* area of your brain where the seizures are originating. This is critical for determining if surgery is even a possibility.  The test *will* require you to have a seizure (or be taken off medication to allow one to occur) so it can be recorded.  This is the source of your biggest fear, and rightly so.\n\n**Addressing Your Fears \u2013 Specifically SUDEP and the Tests**\n\nYour fear of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is *very* valid. It\u2019s a serious concern for anyone with epilepsy, and especially with nocturnal seizures. Here's how to think about this:\n\n* **Risk Mitigation:** Your doctor saying they\u2019ll stop the seizure if they see signs is crucial.  They will be *actively monitoring* you during the test.  They aren't just going to let a seizure run its course unchecked.  They will have medications ready to abort it.\n* **SUDEP Risk and Testing:** While any seizure carries a small risk, the testing environment is designed to *minimize* that risk.  They will have emergency protocols in place.  The benefit of potentially finding a surgical solution needs to be weighed against that risk.\n* **Talking to your doctor:** Again ask about the exact measures they\u2019ll take to mitigate risks during the test. What are their specific protocols for aborting a seizure? How long will they monitor you for afterwards? What will they be specifically looking for to stop the test?\n\n**Your Second Fear: What if it's No Use?**\n\nThis is also understandable.  You're worried about going through all this \u2013 the anxiety of tests, the potential seizure during the PET scan, and the possibility of surgery \u2013 only to find there's no surgical solution.\n\n* **Not Everyone is a Candidate:** It\u2019s important to realize that even with these tests, surgery isn\u2019t guaranteed.  The seizure focus must be in a surgically accessible area of the brain *and* away from critical areas controlling speech, movement, or other vital functions.\n* **The Value of Information:**  Even if surgery *isn't* an option, these tests provide valuable information. Knowing precisely where the seizures originate can help your doctors refine your medication regimen and potentially explore other, less invasive treatments.  It helps you understand *what* you are fighting against.\n* **Other Treatments:**  Even if surgery isn\u2019t possible, there are other options like Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) (a \u201cpacemaker\u201d for the brain), or dietary therapies (like the ketogenic diet) that might be considered.\n\n\n\n**Should You Go For It?**\n\nHere's a framework for thinking about this:\n\n1. **Further Discussion with Your Doctor:**  Have a *very* detailed conversation with your epilepsy specialist.  Ask *all* your questions.  Specifically:\n    * What is the probability that surgery would be a viable option based on their initial assessment?\n    * What are the specific risks of each test, and what measures will be taken to minimize those risks?  (Especially SUDEP).\n    * What are the potential benefits of knowing the seizure focus, even if surgery isn't an option?\n    * What are the alternative treatments if surgery isn't possible?\n2. **Second Opinion:** Consider getting a second opinion from another epilepsy specialist, preferably at a comprehensive epilepsy center.\n3. **Weigh the Risks and Benefits:** Honestly assess your tolerance for risk and your desire for a potential cure.\n4. **Consider Your Quality of Life:** How significantly is epilepsy impacting your life *right now*?  How much is the fear of seizures affecting your mental health and ability to function?\n5. **Involve Your Support System:** Talk to your family, friends, or a therapist about your fears and concerns.\n\n\n\n**Should You Stick with Just Medication?**\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely reasonable to continue with medication management, especially if your seizures are currently controlled. However, you're clearly unhappy with your current situation and the limitations it imposes.  Exploring the possibility of surgery is a valid step if you're willing to accept the risks involved.\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

I have an appointment with my doctor coming up soon, and was hoping to get some information so I could have some good questions to ask regarding treatment, including DBS. Any other recommendations would be great as well. Thank you in advance for your help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack, and it's *excellent* you're being proactive and researching before your doctor's appointment. A new-onset generalized dystonia, especially in someone with temporal lobe epilepsy, requires careful investigation. Here's a breakdown of information, questions for your doctor, and additional recommendations, all aimed at helping you have a productive conversation.  I will preface this with a **DISCLAIMER: I am an AI and *cannot* give medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not substitute a thorough discussion with your neurologist.**\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n* **Generalized Dystonia:** This is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. \"Generalized\" means it affects multiple muscle groups across your body. The fact that this is a *new* onset is crucial.\n* **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy:** Seizures originating in the temporal lobe can manifest in diverse ways \u2013 not always the classic convulsive seizures. They can include emotional changes, unusual sensations, altered awareness, and even motor symptoms. Sometimes, *postictal* states (after a seizure) can *mimic* dystonia.\n* **Keppra (Levetiracetam):**  A commonly used anti-epileptic drug (AED).  It's good you're noting it doesn't seem to be fully controlling your seizures or potentially preventing the dystonia.\n* **Prozac (Fluoxetine):** A Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.  It's important to consider how this interacts with your epilepsy treatment, and if the dystonia could potentially be a side effect or exacerbated by Prozac (though this is less common).\n* **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**  A surgical procedure involving the implantation of electrodes in specific brain areas. These electrodes deliver electrical impulses to modulate brain activity.  It's used for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and *sometimes* epilepsy - though its use for epilepsy is more complex.\n\n\n\n**Possible Causes of the Dystonia (Your Doctor Needs to Investigate)**\n\nYour doctor will need to determine the cause of this new dystonia.  Possibilities include:\n\n* **New-Onset Dystonia:**  Idiopathic (unknown cause) dystonia can appear at any age.\n* **Seizure-Related:** As mentioned before, postictal states can be mistakenly identified as dystonia. Or, the dystonia *could* be a rare manifestation of your temporal lobe epilepsy.  Prolonged or subtle seizure activity could be contributing.\n* **Medication-Induced:**  While less common, some medications can induce dystonia.  Your doctor will need to review *all* your medications, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements.\n* **Autoimmune:**  Certain autoimmune disorders can cause movement disorders.\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:**  Less likely, but a neurodegenerative process could be starting.\n* **Psychogenic (Functional) Dystonia:**  This is a diagnosis of exclusion.  It means there's no identifiable neurological cause, and psychological factors are believed to be playing a significant role.\n\n\n\n**Questions for Your Doctor (Divide them into categories)**\n\nHere\u2019s a categorized list to help you organize your thoughts.  *Write these down and take them with you!*\n\n**1. About the Dystonia Event:**\n\n*   \"Can you help me understand what might have caused this sudden dystonia?\"\n*   \"What tests will you be doing to determine the cause of the dystonia? (e.g., MRI, blood tests for autoimmune markers, EEG)\"\n*   \"Could this dystonia be related to my epilepsy, perhaps as a postictal phenomenon or a seizure manifesting differently?\"\n*   \"Were there any specific triggers I should be aware of that might bring on the dystonia?\"\n*   \"What is the immediate plan of action? (Medication changes, further testing etc.)\"\n\n**2. Regarding Epilepsy Control:**\n\n*   \"My seizures haven\u2019t been fully controlled with Keppra. What are the next steps in optimizing my seizure control?\"\n*   \"Are there other AEDs we could try, either in addition to Keppra or as a replacement?\"\n*    \"What is the likelihood the dystonia is related to seizures, even if they aren\u2019t my typical seizure presentation?\"\n*   \u201cWhat is the role of a prolonged EEG or video EEG in determining if my seizures are contributing?\u201d\n\n**3.  Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): This is a big conversation \u2013 break it down!**\n\n*   **General Suitability:** \"Given my epilepsy and now the dystonia, am I a potentially good candidate for DBS?\"  (Be prepared for them to say \u201cmaybe,\u201d \u201cnot yet,\u201d or \u201cunlikely\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s complex).\n*   **Targets:** \"What specific brain targets would be considered for DBS in my case, considering both my epilepsy *and* the dystonia?\"  (Common targets for epilepsy include the anterior thalamic nucleus or hippocampus; for dystonia, the globus pallidus interna is often used.)\n*   **Risks and Benefits:** \"What are the potential risks and benefits of DBS in my situation, *specifically*?\" (Risks include infection, bleeding, stroke, mood changes, and device malfunction. Benefits could include reduced seizure frequency, reduced dystonia severity, improved quality of life.)\n*   **Evaluation Process:** \"What is the full evaluation process for DBS? What tests would I need to undergo?\" (Typically includes extensive neurological exams, neuropsychological testing, MRI, and potentially intracranial EEG monitoring).\n*    **Success Rates**: \u201cWhat are the success rates for DBS in similar cases of epilepsy and/or dystonia?\u201d\n*   **Realistic Expectations:** \u201cWhat level of improvement can I realistically expect with DBS?\u201d\n*   **Insurance Coverage:**  \u201cWhat is the likelihood my insurance will cover DBS, and what is the process for pre-authorization?\u201d\n\n**4.  Medication Interactions:**\n\n*   \"Could Prozac be contributing to the dystonia or making my epilepsy harder to control?  Is it safe to continue it alongside Keppra?\"\n*   \"Are there any potential drug interactions between Keppra and Prozac that we should be aware of?\"\n\n\n\n**5. Other Potential Therapies/Recommendations:**\n\n*   \u201cAre there any other alternative or complementary therapies I should consider?\u201d (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, botulinum toxin injections for dystonia).\n*  \u201cWould a referral to a movement disorder specialist be helpful?\u201d\n\n\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Keep a Detailed Log:**  Record when the dystonia occurs, its duration, any potential triggers (stress, fatigue, specific activities), and any associated symptoms.  Also, track your seizure activity.\n*   **Video Record Episodes (If Safe):**  If possible and safe to do so, having a video recording of a dystonic episode can be *incredibly* helpful for your doctor.\n*   **Family History:**  Gather information about any family history of neurological or movement disorders.\n*  **Second Opinion:** Don\u2019t hesitate to seek a second opinion from another neurologist, especially one specializing in epilepsy and/or movement disorders.\n* **Support Groups:**  Consider joining support groups for epilepsy or dystonia.  Connecting with others facing similar challenges can be incredibly valuable. (Epilepsy Foundation:  [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)  Dystonia Medical Research Foundation: [https://www.dystonia-foundation.org/](https://www.dystonia-foundation.org/))\n\n\n\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n*   **Be honest and open with your doctor.**\n*   **Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions until you fully understand.**\n*   **Take notes during your appointment.**\n*   **Bring a friend or family member to the appointment for support and to help you remember information.**\n\n\n\nYou're doing the right thing by preparing for your appointment.  The more informed you are, the better you can advocate for yourself and work with your doctor to develop the best treatment plan.  Good luck! Let me know if you have any other questions."

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex case with a lot of history. It's good you've kept detailed records and have videos \u2013 those are valuable.  I'm going to break down this response into sections addressing your questions and offering thoughts, *but please read the disclaimer at the end.*  This is for informational purposes only and *does not* constitute medical advice.  You need to continue working closely with her neurologist.\n\n**1. Was her head to head movement seizure activity?**\n\nHighly likely, yes.  Unresponsive episodes with side-to-side head movements *strongly suggest* seizure activity.  That presentation, especially leading to a prolonged, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, is classic.  The fact that her head movements were towards the *right* side is consistent with the eventual finding of a left temporal lobe focus, as the brain often exhibits contralateral (opposite side) movements during seizures.  \n\n**2. What are your thoughts on what she had?**\n\nThis is tougher, and the initial diagnostic process was clearly trying to unravel a mystery. Here's a breakdown of possibilities, considering the timeline and findings:\n\n* **Initial Acute Presentation (Jan 2017):  Probable Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus Progressing to Convulsive Status Epilepticus.**  The 39.7\u00b0C fever raises the question of an underlying infection triggering this. However, the subsequent investigations didn't reveal a clear culprit.  The prolonged seizure, unresponsiveness, and need for induced coma absolutely fit status epilepticus. The fact she didn't recover between seizures is key to this diagnosis. The initial left temporal focus on EEG also points to a likely origin.\n* **Autoimmune Encephalitis Investigation:** It\u2019s good they considered this, as it can present similarly.  The negative spinal tap results are reassuring, but autoimmune encephalitis can sometimes be \"seronegative\" (not detectable by standard antibody tests). The IVIG was a reasonable trial given the initial uncertainty.\n* **Possible Etiologies (Things to Consider):**\n    * **Febrile-Induced Seizures - Complex:** While usually seen in younger children, a high fever can sometimes trigger complex seizures in adults, especially those with an underlying predisposition. The initial fever could have been the trigger but doesn't explain the ongoing seizures.\n    * **Subtle Structural Lesion:**  The MRI being \"unremarkable\" doesn't rule out *all* structural issues.  Sometimes subtle lesions (like subtle cortical dysplasia, a small malformation of the brain's cortex) are missed.  A higher-resolution MRI with specific epilepsy protocols might be considered if things continue to be unclear.\n    * **Genetic Epilepsy Syndrome:** Some genetic epilepsies can present with variable symptoms and may not be fully identified through standard testing.\n    * **Post-Infectious Epilepsy:** Sometimes, even after an infection seems resolved, it can leave lasting changes in the brain that lead to epilepsy.\n    * **Unknown Etiology (Idiopathic Epilepsy):**  Unfortunately, in a significant percentage of epilepsy cases, a clear cause is never identified.\n\n\n**3. What are your thoughts on the current medication?**\n\nThe cocktail of medications she is currently on (Phenytoin, Levetriacetam, and Sodium Valproate) is a very potent combination.  Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n* **Phenytoin (300mg):**  A classic AED, good for focal seizures.  Effective, but has potential side effects and drug interactions, and level monitoring is important.\n* **Levetiracetam (Keppra) (2500mg):** A very commonly used AED, generally well-tolerated. 2500mg is a high dose - however it is not uncommonly used.\n* **Sodium Valproate (2400mg):** Broad-spectrum AED, effective for various seizure types. However, it has significant potential side effects, *especially* concerning for women of childbearing potential (and even pre-menopause, it can affect hormone levels).  It's good that her neurologist is aware of this and monitoring accordingly.\n\n**Regarding the efficacy of the current medication:** The fact that she's *still* having seizures despite this combination, even if they're not generalized tonic-clonic, is concerning.  This suggests that the current regimen isn't fully controlling her seizure activity.\n\n**Introducing Vimpat:**  This is a reasonable next step.  Lacosamide (Vimpat) works through a different mechanism than the other AEDs, making it a good option to add when other medications haven't provided sufficient control.  It\u2019s often well-tolerated, but as with all AEDs, side effects are possible.\n\n\n**Additional Considerations & Questions to Discuss with her Neurologist:**\n\n* **Video EEG Monitoring:**  *This is crucial*.  If she hasn't had prolonged video EEG monitoring in a specialized epilepsy center, this is the next step.  It allows physicians to correlate the observed seizure activity (from the video) with the EEG recordings, helping to precisely pinpoint the seizure origin and type. This can reveal subtle seizure patterns not apparent during standard EEG.\n* **Repeat MRI with Epilepsy Protocol:**  As mentioned earlier, a more detailed MRI focused on epilepsy can sometimes reveal subtle abnormalities.\n* **Further Autoimmune Workup:**  While the initial tests were negative, sometimes more specialized autoimmune antibody panels and testing for specific encephalitis types (like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, even if initially ruled out) might be repeated, especially given the initial suspicion and the fluctuating course.\n* **Medication Levels:**  Regular monitoring of AED blood levels is essential to ensure she\u2019s within the therapeutic range and to rule out non-compliance or drug interactions. Phenytoin levels are particularly important to monitor.\n* **Seizure Diary:**  Continue to maintain a detailed seizure diary, including time of day, duration, preceding events (stress, sleep deprivation, etc.), and any post-ictal symptoms (confusion, fatigue).\n* **Sleep Study:** Given the nocturnal seizures, a sleep study could be helpful to rule out any sleep-related epilepsy syndromes.\n\n**Regarding the videos you have:**  Bring these to every neurology appointment. They provide invaluable information.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to process, and it's *absolutely* good you're thinking through this and seeking information. You're not overreacting, and your instincts to investigate are smart. It sounds incredibly unsettling to realize past experiences might have been seizures, and the added layer of spiritual experiences is also important to consider. Here's a breakdown addressing your questions, broken down into sections.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 this is not a substitute for medical advice.**\n\n**1. Is it possible you have a mild case of epilepsy?**\n\nYes, it's absolutely possible. What you've described \u2013 two events with a clear aura followed by loss of consciousness/convulsions and a distinct post-ictal phase \u2013 strongly *suggests* seizures.  Seizures don't always look like the dramatic, full-body convulsions often portrayed. They can manifest in many ways.  The fact that yours were triggered by physical sensations (impact, piercing) fits a pattern called *reflex epilepsy,* sometimes *provoked seizures* or *symptomatic epilepsy.* This means a specific stimulus can lower your seizure threshold.  \n\nThe years between seizures *doesn\u2019t* rule out epilepsy.  Epilepsy isn't always constant; some people have infrequent seizures, even years apart.  The definition is generally two *unprovoked* seizures (meaning not directly following a clear trigger like fever, low blood sugar, etc.), but your situations are somewhat \u201cprovoked\u201d yet still raise concern.  The pattern is what's important.\n\n**2. Should you get tested?**\n\n**YES, you absolutely should be evaluated by a doctor.**  Given your history, and the clarity with which you describe the phases, getting a formal diagnosis is *crucial*.  Here's why:\n\n*   **Safety:**  Even infrequent seizures pose risks. Though you've been lucky to have someone there to prevent falls, seizures can happen unexpectedly, potentially in dangerous situations (driving, swimming, etc.).\n*   **Accurate Diagnosis:**  There are other conditions that can mimic seizures. A doctor can rule those out.\n*   **Understanding Triggers:** Identifying your specific triggers (physical impact, piercing, etc.) is vital for prevention.\n*   **Management Options:**  Even if your seizures are infrequent, knowing you have epilepsy allows you and your doctor to discuss strategies to minimize risks and consider medication if necessary.\n\n**3. What are the implications if you *do* have epilepsy?**\n\nThe implications depend heavily on the *type* of epilepsy, the *frequency* of seizures, and how well it responds to treatment. Here's a broad overview:\n\n*   **Lifestyle Adjustments:**  You might need to avoid specific triggers.  Things like getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding excessive alcohol or caffeine can be important.\n*   **Driving Restrictions:**  Most states have laws about driving with epilepsy. The restrictions depend on the type and frequency of seizures.  You'll likely need to be seizure-free for a certain period (often 6 months to a year) to get a license.\n*   **Work/School Considerations:**  You may need to inform your employer or school, depending on the nature of your work or studies, to ensure a safe environment.\n*   **Medication:**  Many effective anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are available.  These can control seizures in many people, though they have potential side effects.\n*    **Potential for more seizures:** Even with medication there is the possibility of \"breakthrough\" seizures. \n\n**4. Should you be worried? Am I making a big deal out of nothing?**\n\nYou're *not* making a big deal out of anything.  You're being responsible by taking this seriously.  It's understandable to feel anxious or worried.  However, *worrying is not productive without a diagnosis*.\n\n*   The fact that your seizures are infrequent and triggered by specific events is somewhat reassuring. It suggests the condition might be relatively mild/controlled.\n*   Many people live full, active lives with epilepsy.  \n\n**5. What steps should you take *now*?**\n\n* **See a Doctor ASAP.**  Start with your primary care physician.  They will likely refer you to a *neurologist,* a doctor specializing in the brain and nervous system.  Tell the neurologist everything you've described: the details of both events, the aura, the post-ictal state, and your concerns about the spiritual experiences. Be as specific as possible about what you felt and experienced.\n* **Keep a Seizure Diary:**  Before your appointment, start documenting any potential triggers, timing, and symptoms.  Even if you don't have another seizure, this information will be helpful.  There are apps for this, or you can keep a notepad.\n* **Inform your partner:**  They've witnessed a seizure and can provide valuable information to the doctor.\n* **Consider a video recording (If possible and safe):** If you feel comfortable, and if you were with someone during a seizure, ask them to video record it. This can be immensely helpful for diagnosis.  *However, safety comes first \u2013 do not put yourself or others at risk trying to record a seizure.*\n* **Be Open with the Doctor About the Spiritual Component:**  It\u2019s important to mention the spiritual connection.  Some types of seizures *can* trigger intense feelings of peace, euphoria, or spiritual insight.  This isn't uncommon.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI Chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

They can properly evaluate your situation, order the necessary tests (like an EEG, MRI, etc.), and provide personalized recommendations.  Do not delay seeking medical attention based on information you read online.\n\n\n\nYou've already taken a huge first step by recognizing the possibility of a medical issue and seeking information.  Now, it's time to get a professional evaluation.  Taking control of this now will give you peace of mind and allow you to live your life to the fullest.

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* important question, and it's good you're proactively researching this before starting HRT. You're right to be concerned about potential interactions between anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and hormone replacement therapy. It's excellent that you have a good understanding of your epilepsy and medications - that will help me explain things clearly.  I will give you a detailed response, but **please read the disclaimer at the very end, as I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.** You *will* need to discuss this with your doctors (neurologist *and* endocrinologist).\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential interactions with Depakote, Keppra, and HRT, specifically in the context of your situation (JME, dosages, and existing triggers):\n\n**Understanding the Interaction Landscape**\n\nThe interaction between AEDs and HRT isn't always straightforward. It's rarely a *direct* chemical interaction. Instead, the changes induced by HRT can affect *how* the body processes (metabolizes) the AEDs \u2013 changing drug levels and potentially leading to breakthrough seizures.  Conversely, some AEDs can impact hormone levels themselves, though not usually to a dramatic degree.  \n\nHere's a breakdown of each drug individually, then a discussion of combined effects and things to consider:\n\n**1. Depakote (Valproic Acid) 2000mg daily**\n\n*   **The Biggest Concern:** Depakote is the more significant concern in this combination. Valproic acid is a potent enzyme inducer *and* inhibitor. This means it can *both* speed up and slow down the metabolism of other drugs, including those in HRT.\n*   **Estrogen & Depakote:** Estrogen metabolism is significantly affected. HRT significantly increases estrogen levels. Valproic acid can *increase* estrogen levels even further by inhibiting its breakdown in the liver (via CYP enzymes \u2013 specifically 3A4, 2C9 and 2C19). Higher estrogen can sometimes *lower* seizure thresholds in susceptible individuals, theoretically increasing seizure risk. However, the impact is complex and not always predictable.  The more concerning issue is the effect on Valproic acid levels.\n*   **Depakote Levels:** HRT can *increase* valproic acid levels. Which can lead to increased side effects and toxicity.  You'd need *frequent* blood monitoring of valproic acid levels if you start HRT, and dosages of Depakote will almost certainly need adjustment. Changes to estrogen levels can change the protein binding of valproic acid, further complicating matters.\n*   **Progesterone & Depakote:** Progesterone tends to have less of a direct effect on valproic acid metabolism but could have modulating effects on estrogen to indirectly impact valproic acid levels.\n*   **JME Specific:**  JME is often sensitive to changes in medication levels.  Maintaining a very stable Depakote level is crucial.\n\n\n\n**2. Keppra (Levetiracetam) 1000mg nightly**\n\n*   **Generally Lower Risk:** Keppra is metabolized differently than Depakote. It's primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, with minimal cytochrome P450 enzyme involvement. This means it's much less prone to drug interactions with HRT components.\n*   **Potential, but Low:** Some studies suggest that estrogen *could* subtly increase Keppra clearance, potentially lowering levels slightly. However, this is typically modest and less clinically significant than the interactions seen with Depakote.  Your dose of Keppra is also relatively low, making large changes in plasma concentration less likely.\n*   **No Significant Impact on HRT:** Keppra is not known to significantly alter hormone levels.\n\n**3.  Other Medications & Supplements:**\n\n*   **Adderall:**  Adding a stimulant like Adderall to this mix adds another layer of complexity. Stimulants can potentially lower seizure thresholds, and might interact with both Depakote and HRT metabolism. Careful monitoring is needed.\n*   **Melatonin:** Melatonin is generally safe, but can impact sleep architecture.  Since sleep is a trigger for you, changes in sleep quality initiated by the melatonin or HRT could potentially impact seizure control.\n*   **Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium & Vitamin D:** These are unlikely to have significant interactions with HRT or your AEDs, but it's good you're taking them for overall health.\n\n\n\n**HRT Components and Considerations**\n\n*   **Estrogen:** (Estradiol, Conjugated Estrogens, etc.) As discussed, this is the primary driver of potential interactions with Depakote.  The *type* of estrogen (e.g., estradiol patches vs. oral estradiol) can also affect how it's metabolized. Transdermal estrogen (patches, gels) avoids first-pass metabolism in the liver, potentially leading to more stable hormone levels and less impact on Depakote metabolism.\n*   **Progesterone:** (Progesterone, Spironolactone):  Progesterone may have a stabilizing effect on seizure threshold in some individuals, but it\u2019s still important to monitor. \n*   **Anti-Androgens:**  (Spironolactone, Cyproterone Acetate):  These are frequently used in feminizing HRT. These *can* have drug interactions, potentially altering Depakote metabolism (spironolactone can affect CYP enzymes). \n\n**What Needs to Happen (and why your neurologist needs to be involved)**\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Baseline:**  Before starting HRT, get baseline bloodwork:\n    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC)\n    *   Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)\n    *   **Valproic Acid Level:** *Essential!*\n    *   **Estradiol, Testosterone, Prolactin:**  Baseline hormone levels to establish a starting point.\n    *   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):**  Depakote can affect liver function.\n    *   Kidney Function Tests (KFTs): Keppra is renally cleared.\n2.  **Endocrinologist Consultation:** You *must* work with an endocrinologist experienced in transgender HRT.  They will determine the appropriate HRT regimen for you.\n3.  **Joint Management:** *Crucially,* your endocrinologist and neurologist *need* to communicate and collaborate.  Ideally, they should be comfortable co-managing your care. Your neurologist needs to be aware of the HRT regimen and be prepared to adjust your Depakote dosage based on regular blood level monitoring.\n4.  **Frequent Monitoring (Initially):** After starting HRT, you'll need frequent monitoring (every 4-8 weeks initially) of:\n    *   Valproic Acid Levels (this is *the* most important thing)\n    *   Hormone Levels (Estradiol, Testosterone, etc.)\n    *   Liver Function Tests\n    *   Kidney Function Tests\n5.  **Seizure Diary:** Keep a detailed seizure diary. Note any changes in seizure frequency, type, or severity.\n\n\n\n**Regarding your shyness about discussing this with your neurologist:**\n\nI understand your hesitation. But withholding this information is risky. Your neurologist needs to know what's going on to protect your health.  Perhaps you could:\n\n*   **Write down your concerns:**  Prepare a written list of questions and concerns to bring to your appointment. This can help you stay focused and ensure you cover everything you want to discuss.\n*   **Bring a friend or advocate:**  Having someone with you can provide support and help you articulate your concerns.\n* **Ask to schedule a longer appointment:** This allows sufficient time to discuss complex issues.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.  The interaction between medications and hormones is complex and highly individualized.  A qualified medical professional can assess your specific situation and provide you with personalized recommendations.\n\n\n\nI hope this provides you with a solid starting point for discussion with your medical team!  Good luck, and please prioritize your health and safety."

        "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That is a *lot* to process, and you're absolutely right to feel overwhelmed and anxious. You're juggling your mother's complex medical situation, family dynamics, financial stresses, and your own future, all while coping with grief and fear. It\u2019s incredibly valid that you\u2019re feeling paralyzed about your job prospects. It's commendable that you're advocating so fiercely for your mother, and taking the time to articulate all of this is important. Let's break down how to approach this, focusing on what *you* can do to prepare for a productive conversation with the doctor and to manage your own well-being.  I will NOT be providing a diagnosis, but some possible avenues to explore with the doctor.\n\n**Regarding Your Mother's Medical Situation - What to Bring to the Doctor**\n\nYou're right to question things and advocate for your mother. You are her best observer. Here\u2019s how to present your concerns effectively:\n\n*   **Detailed Timeline:** This is *crucial*. You've started one here, but a carefully crafted list will be invaluable. Include:\n    *   **Date of first \"falling spells.\"** Be specific.\n    *   **Detailed descriptions of each type of spell:** (The leg shaking, the incoherence after falls, the episodes where she *doesn't* fall but shakes).  Describe *exactly* what you see.  \"Her legs move back and forth violently, almost like she's trying to balance on a surfboard, but she's locked in place.\"\n    *   **Timing of medication changes:** When was she started on Gabapentin? When was Depakote started? When were dosages adjusted? You need a very clear sequence of events tied to symptom changes.\n    *   **Correlation between meds and symptoms:** Specifically link any new or worsening symptoms to the introduction or adjustment of medications.  \"Began experiencing significant memory problems shortly *after* starting both Depakote and Gabapentin.\"\n    *   **Frequency of spells:**  \u201cThese spells were happening several times a day in [Month/Year], now it\u2019s approximately [Frequency] per [Time period].\u201d\n    *   **What *doesn't* happen anymore:** \u201cShe doesn\u2019t lose consciousness like she did last summer.\u201d\n*   **Medication List:** Have a current, complete list of *all* medications, including dosages and how often they are taken. Include over-the-counter meds and supplements.\n*   **Symptom Journal:** For a week or two *before* the appointment, keep a daily log of:\n    *   Time of day of each spell\n    *   What she was doing beforehand\n    *   Detailed description of the spell\n    *   Duration of the spell\n    *   Her level of confusion/awareness during and after\n    *   Any potential triggers (stress, fatigue, activity, etc.)\n*   **Cognitive Changes Documentation:** Keep specific examples of the memory loss and cognitive decline.  Your dinner example is *excellent*. Write down more instances as they happen:\n    *   \"Today, she forgot she had already taken her blood pressure medication.\"\n    *   \"She asked me three times within an hour about the same appointment.\"\n    *   \"She was unable to recall the names of her grandchildren.\"\n*   **Your Concerns, Clearly Stated:** Write down your concerns in bullet points, focusing on the impact on her quality of life.  Like, \u201cI am concerned that the combination of Gabapentin and Depakote may be contributing to her cognitive decline, despite the doctor's belief that they are not interacting.\u201d\n* **Ask for a second opinion:** When able, ask the doctor if it's possible to get a second opinion. \n\n**Possible Avenues to Discuss with the Doctor (Again, NOT a Diagnosis - These are things to *ask* about):**\n\n*   **Drug Interactions/Side Effects:** While the doctor says the Gabapentin and Depakote aren\u2019t interacting, it's worth asking for a specific explanation of *why*.  Ask about potential cumulative side effects, even if they aren't directly linked.  Ask if there are any studies on cognitive effects of this combination, specifically in older adults.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:**  You're right to consider other possibilities.  Specifically:\n    *   **Alzheimer's/Dementia:**  Push for a thorough cognitive assessment.  There are specific tests to evaluate memory, language, and other cognitive functions. While brain plaque *suggests* this, it's not definitive.\n    *   **Vascular Dementia:**  Given her blood pressure issues and history of stroke risk, ask about the possibility of small strokes contributing to her symptoms.\n    *   **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs):**  \"Mini-strokes\" can cause temporary neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Metabolic Issues:** Could there be anything going on with her electrolytes or thyroid that might be contributing?\n    * **Side effects from blood pressure medications:** Some of these can cause dizziness and other neurological issues.\n*   **Epilepsy Re-evaluation:**  Is the current diagnosis still the best explanation for all of her symptoms? Could the \u201cseizures\u201d be something else misdiagnosed as epilepsy? What type of epilepsy has she been diagnosed with and is that diagnosis correct?\n* **Neurology Review**: Ask for a repeat referral to neurology. Perhaps for a second opinion or someone with expertise in her specific type of event.\n\n\n\n**Regarding Your Anxiety and Future**\n\nThis is just as important as your mother\u2019s health.\n\n*   **Acknowledge Your Grief:** You are grieving the loss of the mother you once knew, and anticipating a potential future loss. That is incredibly painful. It's okay to feel sad, scared, and overwhelmed.\n*   **Seek Support for Yourself:**  You need a space to process your feelings.\n    *   **Therapy:**  A therapist can help you cope with anxiety, grief, and the stress of caregiving.\n    *   **Support Groups:**  Look for caregiver support groups (online or in person) where you can connect with others facing similar challenges.\n    *   **Talk to Trusted Friends/Family:**  Don't isolate yourself.  Lean on people you trust.\n*   **Career and Boundaries:** It\u2019s okay to feel conflicted about your job prospects.\n    *   **Explore Flexible Options:** Look for jobs that offer remote work or flexible hours.\n    *   **Discuss with Potential Employers:** Be honest about your family situation (to a degree you're comfortable with) and your need for some flexibility.\n    *   **Practice Self-Care:**  You can't pour from an empty cup.  Prioritize your own well-being, even if it's just 30 minutes a day.\n*   **The Family History:**  The family history is frightening, but it's not a destiny.  Focus on what you *can* control:  ensuring your mother receives the best possible care and taking care of yourself.\n\n**Financial Concerns:**\n\n*   **Medicare Re-application:**  Keep pursuing the Medicare application.  There may be appeals processes or assistance programs available to help.\n*   **Social Services:**  Explore local social services agencies for assistance with healthcare costs, in-home care, or other support.\n*   **Medication Assistance Programs:** Many pharmaceutical companies have programs to help patients afford their medications.\n\n\n\n**You are not alone in this.** You are doing an amazing job advocating for your mom, and it's okay to ask for help.  You've already taken a huge step by reaching out.  Remember to focus on taking things one day at a time, prioritizing your own well-being, and being a compassionate advocate for your mother.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation with a lot of intertwined factors, but you're right to question the changes you're seeing after valproic acid discontinuation. You're observing a fascinating, and frankly, very important set of shifts. Here's a breakdown of potential explanations, broken down into sections, along with what to discuss with her medical team.  I'll aim to be comprehensive but remember *I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice*.  This is about potential avenues for discussion with her doctors.\n\n**1. Understanding the Effects of Valproic Acid (and its Discontinuation)**\n\n* **Beyond Seizure Control:** You're spot on to recognize that valproic acid has uses beyond epilepsy, including mood stabilization.  Even at a low dose, it *can* have subtle effects on brain function. It influences several neurotransmitter systems, potentially dampening emotional reactivity, reducing anxiety, and impacting cognitive processing.  This isn't necessarily about \"treating\" bipolar disorder (which is unlikely given her age and presentation), but more about its broad impact on neuronal excitability.\n* **\"Masking\" vs. Enabling:** What you're describing suggests valproic acid might have been *masking* some underlying issues, or perhaps hindering her development. Because it reduced overall brain excitability, it could have flattened her emotional range and potentially slowed down cognitive processing, making it harder for her to fully engage with and process her environment.  Think of it like turning down the volume on everything - it's quieter, but also less vibrant.  The \"happy-go-lucky\" nature *might* have been a result of this dampened reactivity, rather than her inherent personality.\n* **Discontinuation Syndrome & Re-Emergence:**  Stopping valproic acid, even a low dose, can lead to a period of adjustment. The brain needs to recalibrate without the drug\u2019s influence. This recalibration can manifest as mood swings (which you've observed) and, importantly, as increased awareness and sensitivity.  It\u2019s not a \"withdrawal\" in the classic sense, but a re-emergence of underlying brain activity.\n* **Metabolic Effects:** Valproic acid can affect metabolism and potentially nutrient absorption. While less likely with a low dose, it\u2019s important to consider whether there were subtle nutritional impacts that contributed to her previous presentation.\n\n\n\n**2. The 15q26.1 Microdeletion & Neurodevelopmental Profile**\n\n* **Variable Presentation:**  The 15q26.1 microdeletion is known to have variable expression. Some individuals have minimal impact, while others experience significant neurodevelopmental challenges. This variability is due to many factors, including which genes within the deletion are most affected. \n* **PDD/ASD Spectrum & Communication:**  The microdeletion is often associated with features of PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder, often now categorized within the Autism Spectrum Disorder -ASD).  Communication delays, social difficulties, and repetitive behaviors are common. The change you\u2019re seeing in her communication could be a *true* unlocking of ability that was being held back by the medication, or it could be the natural progression of development now that her brain isn\u2019t being modulated by the drug.\n* **Motor Skills & Coordination:**  The microdeletion can also influence motor development.  The bow-leggedness and difficulties with fine and gross motor skills could be directly related to the genetic deletion.  Occupational and Physical Therapy are often very helpful in these areas.\n* **Synergy with Epilepsy & ADD/ADHD:** The co-occurrence of epilepsy, ADD/ADHD, and the 15q26.1 deletion creates a complex interplay. It\u2019s very possible these conditions influence one another.  For example, seizures (even subclinical ones not always visually obvious) can impact attention and learning.  ADD/ADHD can exacerbate social communication difficulties.\n\n**3.  Regarding the Specific Symptoms**\n\n* **Illiteracy:** This is a crucial area to address.  It's important to rule out visual processing issues (an eye exam is essential) and to work with a specialist (reading specialist, educational psychologist) to determine the best approach to literacy instruction.  The change in awareness post-medication *might* make her more receptive to learning, but she'll likely need targeted intervention.\n* **Bathroom Accidents (Enuresis/Encopresis):** These can be multifactorial. Consider:\n    * **Neurological Factors:** The 15q26.1 deletion, and potentially even the epilepsy, can affect bladder and bowel control.\n    * **Sensory Awareness:** A heightened awareness post-medication could actually *increase* her awareness of the urge to go, but she might still struggle with initiating the behavior or with interpreting the signals correctly.\n    * **Constipation:**  A very common issue in children with neurodevelopmental differences.  Constipation can worsen bladder control.\n    * **Behavioral Factors:** Anxiety or stress can contribute.\n    * **Medical Evaluation:** Ruling out any underlying medical conditions (UTI, etc.) is important.  A pediatric urologist or gastroenterologist might be helpful.\n* **Mood Swings:**  These do warrant investigation.  The fact they are recent suggests they *could* be related to the medication change. However, it's important to understand what's triggering them, how long they last, and how intense they are.  Could there be underlying anxiety or frustration related to the increased awareness and demands now placed on her?\n\n\n\n**What to Discuss with Her Medical Team:**\n\n* **Detailed Timeline:**  Provide your neurologist and developmental pediatrician a *very* detailed timeline of changes since valproic acid discontinuation.  Note:\n    * When did you first notice the shifts in awareness and behavior?\n    *  Specifically, what changed in her communication, social interaction, and overall demeanor?\n    *  Describe the mood swings in detail (frequency, duration, triggers, intensity).\n* **EEG & Seizure History Review:**  Even though she's been seizure-free, discuss the possibility of repeating an EEG to ensure there's no subclinical seizure activity.\n* **Genetic Counseling Review:**  Revisit her genetic diagnosis with a genetic counselor to discuss the latest research on the 15q26.1 deletion and possible correlations with the symptoms you\u2019re now observing.\n* **Neuropsychological Evaluation:**  A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment can provide valuable insights into her cognitive strengths and weaknesses, particularly in areas like attention, executive function, language, and visual-spatial skills. \n* **Therapy Recommendations:**  Discuss the need for ongoing:\n    * **Occupational Therapy:** To address fine motor skills and sensory processing.\n    * **Physical Therapy:** To address gross motor skills and bow-leggedness (and assess if it\u2019s progressing).\n    * **Speech & Language Therapy:**  Continue to support her communication development.\n    * **Behavioral Therapy:**  Develop strategies to manage any increased emotional reactivity or anxiety.\n* **Medication Review:**  Re-evaluate if *any* medication is truly necessary based on her current presentation.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Patience:**  These changes and adjustments take time.\n* **Advocacy:**  You are her best advocate.  Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions and push for the answers and support she needs.\n* **Focus on Strengths:** Celebrate her achievements and focus on building her confidence.\n\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed response is helpful. Remember to proactively engage with her medical team with your observations and concerns. They are the best resource to determine the optimal course of action for your daughter."

        "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is understandably causing you anxiety, and it's good you're trying to understand what's going on. Let's break down what \"spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\" means in the context of your EEG and potential partial seizures.  I'll give a detailed explanation, but **please read the very important disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**Understanding the Terms:**\n\n* **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  This test measures electrical activity in your brain using sensors (electrodes) placed on your scalp. It doesn't *directly* see seizures, it records the *patterns* of brain activity that can indicate seizure activity or a predisposition to it.\n* **Discharges:** In EEG terms, a 'discharge' refers to a pattern of electrical activity.  These can be normal or abnormal.\n* **Spike and Wave:** This is a specific type of abnormal discharge.  It's considered a hallmark finding suggestive of *epileptiform activity*.  \n    * **Spikes** are sharp, brief bursts of electrical activity.\n    * **Waves** are a slower, more flowing electrical pattern.\n    * When they occur *together* frequently (spike *followed by* a wave) it strongly suggests the brain is susceptible to seizures, *even if you didn't have a clinical seizure during the recording.*  It doesn\u2019t automatically *mean* you will have a seizure, but it flags an area of increased excitability.\n* **Right Frontotemporal and Central Regions:**  These are locations on your brain:\n    * **Frontal:**  The front part of your brain, involved in things like planning, decision-making, personality, and voluntary movement.\n    * **Temporal:** The sides of your brain, roughly behind your temples, involved in memory, language, and emotions.\n    * **Central:** The area between the frontal and parietal lobes, primarily involved in processing sensory information (like touch, temperature, pain) and controlling movement.\n    * **Right:**  The findings are localized to the right side of your brain.\n* **Maximally Frontal:** This means the spike-and-wave activity was *most prominent* or strongest in the frontal region of those areas, even though it's also present in the temporal and central regions.  The frontal part of the right frontotemporal/central area is the \"hot spot.\"\n\n\n\n**What Does This Mean For *You*?**\n\nThe letter indicates that the EEG reader found abnormal electrical activity in your brain that is associated with an increased risk of seizures.  Here's how it relates to your situation:\n\n* **Partial Seizures:** You've already been diagnosed with experiencing occasional partial seizures. This EEG finding supports that diagnosis.  \"Partial\" means the seizure starts in one area of the brain (in this case, potentially the right frontotemporal or central regions).  \n* **Subclinical Activity:** The fact you didn't have a *visible* seizure *during* the EEG recording isn't uncommon. The spike-and-wave discharges suggest that your brain is prone to seizures, even when you aren\u2019t outwardly having one. This is sometimes called \"subclinical\" epileptiform activity.  It means there is electrical disturbance, but it hasn't built up enough to cause observable symptoms. Think of it like a \"pre-seizure\" state.\n* **Localization:** The EEG is helping to pinpoint *where* in your brain the seizures might be originating from. This is vital for your neurologist to make the best treatment decisions.  The fact it\u2019s 'maximally frontal' is important information.\n* **Not a Definitive Prediction:**  It\u2019s important to remember that *having* these discharges doesn\u2019t *guarantee* you will have a seizure. It increases the *probability*.  The frequency of these discharges plays a role.  (The letter doesn\u2019t tell us *how often* they were occurring, just that they *were* present.)\n\n\n\n\n**What Happens Next (Typically):**\n\nYour neurologist will likely:\n\n1.  **Consider the Whole Picture:**  Your EEG results are just *one* piece of the puzzle. They\u2019ll consider your medical history, your reported symptoms, and any other test results.\n2. **Medication Review:** They may review or adjust your medication if you are already on anti-epileptic drugs.\n3.  **Further Investigation (possibly):** Depending on the overall clinical picture, they might recommend further testing, such as an MRI of the brain to look for any structural abnormalities that could be contributing to the seizures.\n4. **Lifestyle Discussion:** Your neurologist might discuss lifestyle factors that can potentially trigger seizures (sleep deprivation, stress, flashing lights, etc.).\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI Chatbot and **cannot provide medical advice.** This information is for general educational purposes only and should **not** be substituted for professional medical advice.  **You absolutely need to discuss these EEG results with your neurologist.** The interpretation of an EEG is complex and requires a qualified medical professional who knows your complete medical history.  \n\nI understand it's frustrating you can't reach your neurologist right away.  If you are experiencing a sudden increase in seizure frequency or have any new or concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention by going to the emergency room or urgent care clinic.\n\n\n\nTo help you prepare for your appointment with your neurologist, write down any questions you have \u2013 and don\u2019t hesitate to ask them to explain things in a way you understand.  \n\n\n\n"

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *lot* to unpack, and you're right to feel overwhelmed. It's good you're reaching out, and I will do my best to give you a comprehensive overview of potential options.  I'm not a medical or legal professional, so this is not advice, but information to help you navigate the system.  I'll organize this into sections: **Immediate Medical Needs & Financial Assistance**, **Insurance Options (Now & Future)**, **Disability Options**, and **Resources.**\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I'm noticing you describe frequent episodes of \"zoning in and out\" that *you* identify as seizures.  While I understand you've had some testing, it's crucial to be evaluated by a neurologist in the US who can properly diagnose and manage this.  This is a priority, even with the financial challenges.\n\n\n\n**1. Immediate Medical Needs & Financial Assistance**\n\n*   **Hospital Financial Assistance/Charity Care:** You are right to investigate this. *Every* non-profit hospital (and many for-profit ones) are required to have financial assistance policies.  Reach out to the patient financial services department at the San Diego hospital.  *Specifically ask* about their charity care programs and income-based assistance.  They will likely require documentation of your income and assets, but a $5,000 bill is a substantial amount, and you may be eligible for a significant reduction.  Don\u2019t be afraid to negotiate!  Hospitals often accept lower lump-sum payments.\n*   **Medical Debt Advocates:**  There are organizations that can help you negotiate medical bills.  Rip Medical Debt is one (they buy and forgive debt), but search for others specific to California. \n*   **County Medical Programs:**  You are right to contact a San Diego County worker on Monday.  Even with unemployment income, *ask specifically* about emergency medical assistance programs (sometimes called Presumptive Eligibility) for urgent medical needs.  Explain the situation \u2013 seizures, inability to work, the initial misdirection from the clinic about benefits.  Be prepared with all your documentation.  **Important Question:** Ask if the county has a patient advocate who can help navigate the system and explore options on your behalf.\n*   **211 San Diego:**  Call 2-1-1 (see Resources below). They are a comprehensive information and referral service and can connect you with local resources for medical care, financial assistance, and other support services.\n*   **Free/Low-Cost Clinics:** Even while seeking long-term insurance, continue looking for free or low-cost clinics. These can provide at least some basic care while you\u2019re figuring things out. Search for \"free clinics San Diego\" online. Most hospitals have a charity clinic.\n\n**2. Insurance Options (Now & Future)**\n\n*   **Covered California (Again):** You\u2019ve already started here, but revisit the Covered California website.  **Important:**  The income threshold for subsidies *changes annually.*  It's possible a change in circumstances (like documented inability to work) might open up different levels of assistance. Also, explore \u201cCost Sharing Reduction\u201d plans which can lower copays and deductibles.\n*   **Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid):**  This is the state and federal program for low-income individuals. While your unemployment *usually* makes you ineligible, *your current medical condition* might create a \u201cMedically Needy\u201d pathway.  This is where you can qualify even with income above the standard limits if your medical expenses exceed a certain percentage of your income.  This is something to discuss *specifically* with the county worker on Monday.\n*   **Medicare:**  Generally, Medicare is for people 65+ or those with certain disabilities.  It *is* possible to qualify under 65 with a disability, but the standard is high. Epilepsy *can* potentially meet the criteria, but it's a complex application process (see Disability Options below).  The diagnosis needs to be well-documented by a US physician.  The Mexican diagnosis *might* be considered, but it will be much harder to get it accepted.\n*   **COBRA:** Since you recently left a job, you may have COBRA options, but it\u2019s almost certainly too expensive unless you have significant savings. However, it exists as a temporary bridge.\n*    **Short-term health insurance:** While sometimes an option, it is usually very limited in scope of coverage and can deny patients coverage for pre-existing conditions like your neurological issues and seizures\n\n**3. Disability Options**\n\n*   **Short-Term Disability (STD):**  You're correct, this would likely come through your current employer (assuming they offer it). It requires a doctor's note stating you're unable to work.  The qualifying criteria can be strict.\n*   **Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI):**  You are right \u2013 it's difficult to qualify, even with a serious condition, especially under 50.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a strict definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d Epilepsy *can* be a qualifying condition, but you need significant medical documentation (from US doctors) demonstrating the severity and impact of your seizures on your ability to work.  *Start* the application process now, even if you\u2019re not optimistic. It takes a long time.\n*   **Supplemental Security Income (SSI):**  This is a needs-based program for people with limited income and resources.  You might qualify for SSI while you\u2019re waiting for SSDI, especially if your unemployment runs out.\n\n**4. Resources**\n\n*   **Covered California:** [https://www.coveredca.com/](https://www.coveredca.com/)\n*   **Medi-Cal:**[https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal)\n*   **211 San Diego:** [https://211sandiego.org/](https://211sandiego.org/) or dial 2-1-1\n*   **Social Security Administration (SSA):** [https://www.ssa.gov/](https://www.ssa.gov/)\n*   **Rip Medical Debt:** [https://ripmedicaldebt.org/](https://ripmedicaldebt.org/) (and search for other medical debt relief organizations)\n*   **Legal Aid Society of San Diego:** [https://www.legalaidsociety.org/](https://www.legalaidsociety.org/) (can provide free legal advice regarding public benefits)\n\n\n\n**Key Action Steps \u2013 In Order of Priority:**\n\n1.  **Neurologist Appointment (US):**  This is paramount.  Find a neurologist who accepts your insurance (even if it's a high-deductible plan initially) or who offers a sliding-scale fee.\n2.  **Hospital Financial Assistance:** Start the application process immediately.\n3.  **County Worker Meeting (Monday):**  Go prepared with documentation, and specifically ask about emergency assistance and the \u201cMedically Needy\u201d pathway.\n4.  **SSD Application:** Begin the online application process; don't delay.\n5.  **Explore Free/Low-Cost Clinics:** For ongoing care while you're navigating the insurance options.\n6.  **Consider translation of Mexican records:**. While a US diagnosis is preferred, accurate translation of your records could be helpful to your US doctor and in your disability claim\n\n**Regarding your concern about pausing unemployment:**  That's likely not possible. Unemployment is based on job separation, not medical condition.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou\u2019re in a very difficult situation, but you\u2019re taking the right steps by seeking information.  Be persistent, be your advocate, and don't be afraid to ask for help.  Document everything \u2013 dates of calls, names of people you speak with, and what was discussed.  \n\n\n\nI sincerely hope this helps.  Please feel free to ask if anything is unclear, or if you have further questions.  I wish you all the best in getting the care you need.\n\n\n\n"

        "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this *is* a complex situation, with a long and understandably confusing history. You're absolutely right to question what's going on, and you're smart to notice the differences in these events compared to your prior seizure presentations. Let's break this down. I'll give a detailed response, but **please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 this is *not* a substitute for medical advice, and you need to discuss this directly with your neurologist.**\n\n**First, let's acknowledge the complexity:**\n\n*   **Significant Brain History:**  You\u2019ve been through a *lot*.  Multiple strokes, surgery, epilepsy since childhood, and now an autoimmune disorder \u2013 all of these can impact how seizures manifest and how your brain functions.\n*   **Established Epilepsy:** Having a well-established diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy is crucial.  Your baseline understanding of your auras and seizure patterns is valuable.\n*   **Work-Related Trigger:** The consistent association with work is a *very* important clue.  This strongly suggests a triggering factor, but doesn't automatically mean non-epileptic.\n\n**Now, addressing your questions and possibilities:**\n\n**1.  Are you having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing?**\n\n*   **Absolutely possible.** Epilepsy can change.  The way seizures present can evolve over time, especially after brain surgery, strokes, or changes in medication.  A new focus (area of the brain generating seizures) could be involved, and this could manifest as twitching and breathing difficulty. \n*   **Frontal Lobe Involvement:**  Seizures originating in the frontal lobe can often present with motor symptoms (twitching, jerking) *and* autonomic changes, including difficulty breathing, even if it doesn't progress to a full convulsion. Temporal lobe seizures *can* spread to involve other areas, including the frontal lobe, especially after surgery or stroke.\n*   **Breathing Issues & Epilepsy:**  Breathing difficulties during seizures *can* occur, either due to the seizure affecting the brain areas controlling respiration, or due to posturing that impedes breathing.\n\n**2. Or are you having nonepileptic seizures (PNES) triggered by work stress?**\n\n*   **Also possible.** PNES (formerly psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) are *involuntary* events that look like seizures, but aren\u2019t caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  They're thought to be related to psychological or emotional distress.\n*   **Stress as a Trigger:** Work can be a significant stressor, and stress is a common trigger for PNES.\n*   **The Aura Question:** This is the tricky part. Some people with PNES *do* experience pre-event sensations that they describe as auras.  The current understanding is that these aren't true auras in the neurological sense (like the buildup of abnormal electrical activity), but rather a *dissociative* experience, a premonition, or a heightened anxiety/awareness of the body.  The fact that you recognize these auras as identical to your established epileptic auras doesn't rule out PNES, but it does make it more complex.\n\n**3. Would someone having non-epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non-epileptic seizures?**\n\n*   **It varies greatly.** Some people with PNES are fully aware during the event, feeling anxious and distressed, but unable to control their body.  Others feel less aware or even completely dissociated.  Still others have amnesia for the event afterward.  It's not uncommon for people to *believe* they are having epileptic seizures initially, especially given your existing history.\n\n**4.  Regarding the Headache:**\n\n*   The difference in headache severity is also meaningful. A typical post-ictal headache can be debilitating, so a milder headache is more suggestive of something different. However, headache responses *can* vary.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why this is a difficult diagnosis and what needs to happen:**\n\n*   **Overlapping Symptoms:** Twitching, breathing difficulties, and auras can be present in both epileptic and non-epileptic events.\n*   **Complex History:** Your brain's \"rewiring\" from previous issues makes interpreting symptoms harder.\n*    **Antiphospholipid Syndrome:** This autoimmune disorder can also affect the brain and neurological function which could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n**What you *need* to do (and discuss with your neurologist):**\n\n1.  **Video-EEG Monitoring (VEEG):**  This is the *gold standard* for differentiating between epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. You would be monitored in a hospital setting while having these episodes, and the EEG would record your brain's electrical activity.  Ideally, you would try to recreate the work-like environment as much as possible. This is absolutely crucial.\n2.  **Detailed Event Logs:**  Keep a meticulous log of each episode, including:\n    *   Date and time\n    *   Specific symptoms (be as detailed as possible: what exactly does the twitching look like, where is the breathing difficulty felt, what is the aura like?)\n    *   What you were doing *immediately* before the episode (specific tasks, stressors)\n    *   What happened *during* the episode (as described by witnesses if possible)\n    *   What you felt *after* the episode (headache specifics, fatigue, confusion, emotional state)\n3.  **Psychological Evaluation:**  A consultation with a psychologist or psychiatrist experienced in PNES is helpful. They can assess for stress, anxiety, trauma, or other psychological factors that might be contributing. *This does not mean they think you're \"making it up.\"* PNES is a very real neurological condition with a strong psychological component.\n4. **Review Medications:** Discuss your current epilepsy medications with your neurologist.  Are they optimally dosed?  Could they contribute to side effects that mimic seizures?\n5.  **Consider Neuroimaging:** An updated MRI might be helpful to look for any new changes in your brain.\n\n\n\n\n**In summary:** It's very possible this is a new manifestation of your epilepsy, but PNES is also a strong possibility given the work-related trigger and your complex history. You need a thorough evaluation, primarily with VEEG monitoring, to determine what's happening. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and insist on this testing.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really complex situation, and you\u2019re absolutely right to ask this question. It's incredibly insightful of you to consider the potential impact of long-term AED (anti-epilepsy drug) use on your mood, *especially* given the recent discovery of the non-epileptic nature of your seizures and the subsequent mood instability.  Here's a breakdown of why your thought is valid, what might be going on, and what steps you should take.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you *absolutely must* discuss this with your doctors.**\n\n**1. Why Your Question is Valid: AEDs and Mood**\n\nYou're absolutely right to question if the AEDs were inadvertently masking or managing something related to your mood.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n* **AEDs are Neurologically Active:**  AEDs don't *just* affect seizure activity. They have broader effects on the brain, impacting neurotransmitters and pathways involved in mood regulation.\n* **Specific AEDs and Mood Effects:**\n    * **Topiramate:**  Known for potential mood side effects, including depression, anxiety, and irritability.  It\u2019s also been linked to cognitive changes.\n    * **Lamotrigine:**  Often *used* as a mood stabilizer, particularly in bipolar disorder, but can also cause mood changes in some individuals.  It\u2019s a complicated drug in this regard.\n    * **Epilim (Valproic Acid/Sodium Valproate):** Can have significant effects on hormones and is linked to mood instability and, in some cases, increased risk of depression.\n    * **Keppra (Levetiracetam):**  While generally well-tolerated, can be associated with irritability, emotional lability (rapid mood swings), and even depression or anxiety in some people.\n* **Long-Term Use & Brain Adaptation:**  14 years is a *long* time to be on these medications.  Your brain adapts to their presence. When they're removed, it can take time for the brain to re-regulate, and sometimes, the underlying issues that were perhaps being partially managed by the drugs become more apparent.\n* **Endometriosis & PCOS Link:** Both endometriosis and PCOS have strong links to mood disorders like depression and anxiety. Hormone fluctuations inherent in these conditions can significantly impact mental health.\n* **Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES) & Trauma/Psychological Factors:** NES are often (though not always) linked to underlying psychological trauma, stress, or emotional difficulties.  The fact that your seizures were diagnosed as NES suggests exploring those underlying factors is crucial.\n\n\n\n**2. What Might Be Happening \u2013 Potential Scenarios**\n\nSeveral things could be contributing to your current situation:\n\n* **Discontinuation Syndrome:**  Coming off AEDs, even when appropriate, can cause withdrawal-like symptoms, including mood changes. This is especially true with abrupt changes in dosage.  This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re \u201caddicted,\u201d but rather the brain needs to readjust.\n* **Underlying Mood Disorder Emergence:**  The AEDs *may* have been subduing a pre-existing mood disorder (like bipolar disorder, cyclothymia, or a severe form of depression with atypical features) that is now becoming more prominent. Your description of rapidly shifting from \"extremely low\" to \"a bit reckless\" raises a flag for possible bipolar spectrum disorder, but a proper diagnosis is critical.\n* **Endometriosis/PCOS Impact:** The hormonal imbalances and chronic pain associated with endometriosis and PCOS can worsen mood symptoms. It\u2019s possible this was always a factor, but became more noticeable when the AEDs were removed.\n* **NES & Unprocessed Trauma:**  If your NES are related to past trauma or unresolved emotional issues, those issues may now be surfacing and contributing to your mood swings and low periods.\n* **Mirtazapine's Role:**  Mirtazapine, while helpful for depression, can also have side effects like weight gain (which can contribute to emotional distress) and, in some people, can potentially contribute to impulsivity.\n* **Combined Effect:** It\u2019s likely a combination of several of these factors.\n\n\n\n**3. What You *Need* to Discuss with Your Doctors**\n\nThis is where things get crucial.  Here's what you should raise with your medical team (ideally, a team including a psychiatrist, your gynecologist, and potentially a neurologist/epileptologist):\n\n* **Detailed Medication History:**  Provide a *very* detailed history of all the AEDs you've taken, including dosages, duration of treatment, and how you felt on each medication.\n* **Timeline of Symptoms:**  Describe the exact timeline of your mood changes *in relation* to stopping the AEDs.  When did the swings start? How quickly did they develop?\n* **Specific Mood Symptoms:**  Be precise about your mood experiences.  \"Low\" and \"reckless\" are starting points, but details matter.  Are you experiencing:\n    * **Depression:** Persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, changes in appetite or sleep?\n    * **Mania/Hypomania:** Elevated mood, increased energy, racing thoughts, impulsivity, decreased need for sleep? (This is particularly important given the \"reckless\" behavior).\n    * **Irritability:**  Increased frustration, anger, or agitation\n    * **Anxiety:** Excessive worry, fear, or panic?\n* **Rule Out Bipolar Disorder:** Explicitly ask your doctor to evaluate you for bipolar disorder or other bipolar spectrum disorders.  This often involves a thorough psychiatric assessment. Your current symptoms are suggestive enough to warrant serious consideration.\n* **Endometriosis/PCOS Management:** Discuss how your endometriosis and PCOS are being managed, and whether hormone fluctuations might be contributing to your mood.\n* **NES & Therapy:** If you haven\u2019t already, explore therapy specifically geared towards understanding and addressing the psychological factors underlying your non-epileptic seizures.  Trauma-informed therapy (e.g., EMDR, CBT) can be very helpful.\n* **Mirtazapine Review:** Discuss the potential side effects of mirtazapine and whether it\u2019s the most appropriate medication for your current symptom profile.  The dosage may need to be adjusted, or a different medication considered.\n* **Consider a Mood Diary:**  Start keeping a daily mood diary to track your mood fluctuations, triggers, and any patterns you notice. This can be very helpful for your doctors.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Be Your Own Advocate:** You know your body and your experiences best. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, express concerns, and push for thorough evaluation.\n* **Patience:**  Figuring this out will likely take time and may involve trial and error with medications and therapies.\n* **Safety:**  Given your recent suicidal ideation, it's vital to have a safety plan in place and ongoing support from a mental health professional.  If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out for help immediately (see resources below).\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada, or dial 111 in the UK.\n* **The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/)\n* **The Endometriosis Foundation of America:**  [https://www.endofound.org/](https://www.endofound.org/)\n* **PCOS Awareness Association:** [https://www.pcosawareness.org/](https://www.pcosawareness.org/)\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope this information is helpful.  Please prioritize your mental health and seek the comprehensive medical attention you deserve. You've already taken a great first step by asking this important question.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* complex case, and you are completely right to seek input to bring to your doctors. You've provided a wealth of information, which is excellent.  I am an AI and *cannot* provide medical advice. This is a detailed analysis based on the information you've given, meant to help you formulate questions and discuss possibilities with your medical team.  I will break this down into several sections: potential causes, concerning factors, important questions to ask your doctors, and harm reduction considerations (given your self-medication).\n\n\n\n**I. Potential Causes \u2013 A Differential Diagnosis (What could be going on?)**\n\nGiven your history, the possibilities are broad. Here's a breakdown, grouped by likelihood based on the information provided.  This isn't a ranking of severity, just how plausible they seem given your description.\n\n*   **Epilepsy-Related Headache:** This is *high* on the list. Your history of migraines *preceding* epilepsy, the evolution of your seizures, and the visual auras with your headaches all point towards a potential link. Some types of epilepsy are inherently associated with headaches.  Specifically:\n    *   **Postictal Headache:** Headache *after* a seizure.  Even subtle seizures (non-convulsive) can cause this.  You may not even *notice* a full seizure happening.\n    *   **Interictal Headache:**  Headsaches *between* seizures, actually part of the epileptic syndrome. This is less common but a possibility.\n    *   **Epileptic Aura Expanding:**  While you describe the auras as visual, sometimes auras can manifest as headache itself.\n*   **Chronic Daily Headache (CDH):**  This is a broad category, and you likely qualify. CDH encompasses chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, and new daily persistent headache.  The fact that your headaches are almost continuous for months fits this.  However, given your history, attributing it *solely* to CDH without investigating other causes would be a mistake.\n*   **Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH):**  This is a *major* concern, due to your frequent use of ibuprofen and kratom.  Ironically, these taken to treat headache can *cause* more frequent and severe headaches. This is a very common cause of chronic daily headache.\n*   **Cervicogenic Headache:** Pain referred from the neck. Your description of the pain radiating to the neck makes this a possibility.  However, it doesn't explain the visual auras as well.\n*   **Vascular Issues:** While your blood pressure is generally good, the throbbing nature of the pain, especially on one side, raises the possibility of  something affecting blood vessels in the head.  This is less likely given your age, but needs to be considered.\n*   **Rare Possibilities:**  Given your family history, though less likely, consider:\n    *   **Familial Hemiplegic Migraine:** A rare genetic form of migraine with neurological symptoms.\n    *   **Underlying Structural Issue:**  (Though less likely given your length of symptoms and likely prior imaging.)\n\n\n\n**II. Concerning Factors \u2013 What stands out that needs urgent attention.**\n\n*   **Kratom & Ibuprofen Use:** This is the biggest IMMEDIATE concern.  Regular use of both can worsen headaches and lead to dependence.  It also complicates diagnosis.\n*   **Increasing Seizure Frequency:**  Your seizures are becoming more frequent *despite* being on multiple medications. This suggests potential medication failure or an evolving epilepsy syndrome. This *must* be addressed urgently with your epileptologist.\n*   **Visual Auras:** Visual disturbances are particularly important. While you've experienced these before, a change in their pattern or frequency should be investigated.\n*   **Slow Progression, Lack of Response to Treatments:**  The persistence of the headaches for 3+ months, and lack of relief from past migraine medications, is concerning.\n*    **Low Resting Heart Rate**: A resting pulse of 40-60 bpm is quite low. While it can be normal in athletes, given your medication list (Propranolol, Baclofen, Acamprosate) it is worth investigating, and could contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion which would manifest as headache.\n\n\n\n**III. Questions to Ask Your Doctors (Bring this list!)**\n\nHere's a categorized list of questions to discuss with each specialist:\n\n**To Your Epileptologist:**\n\n*   \"Given the increasing frequency of my seizures, can we re-evaluate my medication regimen?  Are there other options to consider?\"\n*   \"Is it possible these prolonged headaches are related to my epilepsy \u2013 either as postictal headaches, interictal headaches, or something else within my seizure disorder?\"\n*   \"Could I be having subtle, non-convulsive seizures that are contributing to the headaches?\"  (Ask about an EEG, even if you're not actively seizing.)\n*   \"Should I consider continuous EEG monitoring to correlate my headaches with brain activity?\"\n*   \"What is my epilepsy syndrome? (precise type) Has it changed/progressed?\"\n\n**To Your Neurologist (general):**\n\n*   \"Based on my history, what is your opinion on the most likely cause of these prolonged headaches?\"\n*   \"What further diagnostic tests do you recommend? (MRI, CT scan, cerebral angiogram, lumbar puncture, etc.)\"  *Specifically ask about imaging to rule out structural issues*.\n*    \"If medication overuse headache is suspected, what is the best way to safely taper off of Ibuprofen and Kratom?\"\n*   \"Are there alternative headache treatments that may be more effective for me, given my complex medical history?\"\n*   \"Could a nerve block be appropriate to diagnose cervicogenic headache?\"\n*   \"Could these be transformed migraines?\"\n\n**To Your PCP:**\n\n*   \"What is your assessment of my low resting heart rate, considering my medication list? Should any medications be adjusted?\"\n*   \"Can you help me develop a plan to safely taper off of Ibuprofen and Kratom, and manage potential withdrawal symptoms?\"\n*    \"Are there any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to my headaches?\" (Thyroid, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n**IV. Harm Reduction & Self-Medication**\n\n*   **Ibuprofen & Kratom \u2013 STOP:**   These are likely making things *worse*.  Work with your doctors to find a safe tapering schedule. Stopping suddenly can cause withdrawal.\n*   **Hydrocodone/Oxycodone \u2013 AVOID:** These are not a long-term solution and will likely worsen your headache problems in the long run.\n*   **Honesty:** Be completely honest with your doctors about your kratom and past opioid use.  This is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n*   **Mental Health:** Chronic pain and epilepsy can significantly impact mental health.  Consider talking to a therapist or counselor.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI and this information is for informational purposes only. It is *not* a substitute for professional medical advice. You *must* discuss these concerns with your doctors to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n\n\n\n**To help your doctors, consider keeping a detailed headache diary:**\n\n*   **Date/Time:** When does the headache start and end?\n*   **Location:** Where is the pain?\n*   **Intensity:**  Rate on a scale of 1-10.\n*   **Quality:**  (Throbbing, pressure, stabbing, etc.)\n*   **Associated Symptoms:** (Nausea, vomiting, visual auras, sensitivity to light/sound, etc.)\n*   **Triggers:** (Stress, weather changes, foods, etc.)\n*   **Medications Taken:**  What did you take and how much?\n*   **Seizure Activity:**  Did you have a seizure before or after the headache?\n\nGood luck. I hope you find answers and relief soon. You've taken a good first step by seeking information and preparing to advocate for yourself."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is *absolutely* a valid and important question. You're right to think it through carefully. Welding and a history of even *possible* seizures is a complex situation. Here's a breakdown of the risks, considerations, and what you need to do.  I'll give a detailed answer, but **please read the disclaimer at the very end. I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Risks: Why Welding & Seizures Don't Mix Well**\n\nWelding presents numerous hazards that become significantly more dangerous if someone were to experience a seizure. Here's why:\n\n* **Height & Working Position:** Often, welders work at heights, in confined spaces, or in awkward positions. A seizure in these situations can lead to a fall with severe injuries.\n* **Hot Materials & Equipment:**  Hot metal, sparks, open flames, and electrical equipment are all present.  A seizure could cause you to come into contact with these, resulting in burns, electrical shock, or other trauma.\n* **Moving Machinery:** Welding often involves moving parts, grinders, and other tools. Loss of consciousness during a seizure could result in entanglement or impact injuries.\n* **Heavy Equipment:**  Handling heavy welding equipment or materials could become dangerous during a seizure.\n* **Spatial Disorientation:** Even subtle seizure activity (like an aura) can cause confusion and disorientation, which can lead to mistakes and accidents.\n* **Arc Flash:** The intense light from arc welding can potentially trigger seizures in photosensitive individuals (though this is less common with the types of seizures you describe related to medication, it's still a factor).  This is why proper shielding is critical for *everyone*.\n\n\n\n**Your Situation - Positives & Considerations:**\n\n* **3 Years Seizure-Free:** This is *very* positive.  A prolonged period without seizures significantly decreases the immediate risk.  However, it doesn't eliminate it completely.\n* **Medication Control:** You're taking medication to manage the underlying condition. This is crucial.\n* **Lifestyle Changes:**  Diet and lifestyle adjustments demonstrate your commitment to managing your health.\n* **Young & Generally Healthy:**  Your age and overall good health are also favorable factors.\n* **Awareness:** You're proactively identifying and addressing potential risks.\n\n**What You *Must* Do - Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Neurologist Consultation \u2013 ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL:** This is the *most important* step.  You *must* discuss this with your neurologist.  Specifically, ask:\n    * **Current Seizure Risk:** What is my current estimated risk of seizure, given my medication, lifestyle, and 3-year history?\n    * **Welding-Specific Risk:** Does welding (considering the potential for heat stress, bright lights, fumes, and physical exertion) increase my risk?\n    * **Work Restrictions:** Are there any specific restrictions or precautions I should take regarding physically demanding or potentially hazardous work?\n    * **Documentation:**  Get a written statement from your neurologist outlining your seizure history, current status, medication, and their professional opinion on your ability to safely weld.  This will be needed for employers and potentially insurance.\n    * **Emergency Plan:** Discuss a plan for what to do if you *were* to have a seizure at work (alert coworkers, first aid responders, etc.).\n\n2. **Employer Disclosure (If Hired):** *Be upfront with any potential employer.*  You are legally obligated to disclose medical conditions that could pose a safety risk.  This is not about discrimination; it's about protecting yourself and others.  Present your neurologist's documentation.  A responsible employer will work with you to assess risks and implement safety measures.\n\n3. **Thorough Risk Assessment with the Employer/Safety Officer:** Work *with* your employer (or a safety officer) to conduct a detailed risk assessment of the welding tasks you'll be performing.  This assessment should:\n    * Identify all potential hazards.\n    * Evaluate the likelihood and severity of a seizure occurring in each scenario.\n    * Develop control measures to mitigate those risks.\n\n4. **Strict Adherence to PPE and Safety Procedures:**  Even with a low risk, you must *always* follow *all* safety procedures without exception. This includes:\n    * **Welding Helmet with Auto-Darkening Filter:**  Essential for protecting against arc flash.  Ensure it's functioning properly.\n    * **Welding Gloves, Jacket, and Protective Clothing:**  Protect against burns and sparks.\n    * **Safety Glasses (Under the Helmet):**  An additional layer of eye protection.\n    * **Respirator (If Necessary):** To protect against welding fumes.  Proper fit testing is mandatory.\n    * **Safety Boots:** With good ankle support and electrical hazard protection.\n    * **Fall Protection (If Working at Height):** Harness, lanyard, and secure anchor point.\n    * **Buddy System:**  *Crucially important*. *Always* work with a trained coworker who is aware of your medical condition and knows what to do in case of a seizure.  They should be within visual and vocal range at all times.  This is non-negotiable.\n    * **Proper Training and Certification:**  Ensure you have all the required welding certifications and training.\n\n5. **Monitor Your Health:**  Pay close attention to your body. If you feel unwell, fatigued, or experience any unusual sensations (auras, dizziness, etc.), *stop welding immediately* and seek medical attention.\n\n6. **Regular Medical Checkups:** Continue to follow up with your neurologist as recommended.\n\n\n**Possible Modifications to Consider (Discuss with Neurologist & Employer):**\n\n* **Avoid Confined Spaces:**  If possible, avoid welding tasks in confined spaces.\n* **Ground Work:**  Prioritize welding tasks that can be performed at ground level.\n* **Shorter Shifts/Breaks:**  Consider shorter work shifts or more frequent breaks to reduce fatigue.\n* **Avoid Extreme Temperatures:** Work in a well-ventilated and temperature-controlled environment.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Weird version of sleep paralysis that feels like it\u2019s in my head and somethings rattlingSo I get this weird sleep paralysis and sometimes it happens multiple times a night. But it\u2019s like where I\u2019m paralized but idt I can open my eyes. It feels like my brain is \u201ctight\u201d. like my brain feels like it\u2019s rattling or something that could explode. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m in a hurricane. And sometimes I feel like I can control the feeling. Like if I ask myself a yes or no question. Bunch of times.. when an answers right the hurricane feeling will get much heavier. I have no clue how to explain it but this morning I felt like there was a \u201cmagnet\u201d moving my had to my forehead. The thing is my hand couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t actually move Bc I was laying on it but it was like in my imagination. It feels like my brain is zipped up. I sometimes think I can hear it. It happens when I\u2019m waking up, falling asleep, or laying in bed It\u2019s kinda like a whooshing feeling",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds *very* unsettling and definitely warrants a conversation with a medical professional. You're describing a profoundly strange experience that goes beyond typical sleep paralysis, and the sensations you're experiencing are quite specific and concerning. Let's break down what you're saying and then discuss potential avenues for help.\n\n**Let's recap what you're describing:**\n\n* **Atypical Sleep Paralysis:** You experience paralysis, but with a significant difference - a feeling of inability to open your eyes, which isn't common in typical sleep paralysis.\n* **Intracranial Sensations:** The core of the experience seems to be *inside* your head \u2013 a \"tight\" brain, rattling sensations, a feeling of potential explosion, a hurricane-like sensation.  This is the most concerning aspect.\n* **Perceptual Distortion/Hallucinations:**  The 'magnet' pulling on your hand, but only in your perception, is a strong indicator of a hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucination (occurring as you fall asleep or wake up) that's unusually vivid and *felt* rather than just seen.\n* **Sense of Control (and Validation):** The ability to seemingly \"test\" the sensations with yes/no questions and the resulting intensification when the answer feels right is\u2026unusual. It suggests a complex neurological process at play.  This isn't something typically reported with sleep paralysis.\n* **Whooshing Sound:** You also experience a whooshing sound, which could be related to the internal pressure/hurricane feelings, or a related auditory hallucination.\n* **Timing:** This occurs during sleep transitions (falling asleep, waking up, or while lying in bed).\n\n\n\n**Why this is different from \"typical\" sleep paralysis:**\n\nRegular sleep paralysis usually involves being aware but unable to move, often accompanied by visual or auditory hallucinations, and sometimes a feeling of pressure on the chest or a sense of dread.  What you're describing is much more focused *within* your head, with a strong physical (though seemingly impossible) sensation of internal pressure and movement.  The \"magnet\" example is beyond typical imagery.  The 'testing' with questions is also noteworthy.\n\n**Possible (but *not definitive* - you need a doctor!) Explanations:**\n\nI am an AI and cannot diagnose you. Here are some possibilities *a doctor* might explore, ranging from more common to less:\n\n* **Complex Sleep Paralysis with Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** While atypical, it\u2019s possible this is a particularly strong and unusual presentation of sleep paralysis. The added internal sensations and the 'testing' element definitely make it more complex.\n* **Hypnic Jerks (with Intensified Perception):** Hypnic jerks are those sudden twitches you get as you fall asleep.  It's conceivable an especially strong one could be misinterpreted as a \"rattle\" or internal movement, especially if you're already predisposed to anxiety.  However, this doesn't explain all of your symptoms.\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Some migraines are preceded (or accompanied) by neurological symptoms that can include unusual sensations, visual disturbances, and a feeling of pressure. The timing during sleep/wake transitions could align.\n* **Neurological Condition:** *This is the most concerning possibility and why a medical evaluation is crucial.* Conditions affecting the brain, such as those involving pressure or altered sensory processing, could manifest in these ways.  Consider, for example:\n    * **Intracranial Hypertension:** Increased pressure inside the skull.\n    * **Sensory Processing Disorder:**  Difficulty interpreting sensory information.\n    * **Rare Neurological Conditions:**  (These are less likely, but a doctor needs to rule them out.)\n* **Psychological Factors:** Anxiety, stress, or underlying mental health conditions can sometimes exacerbate or contribute to unusual sleep experiences. *However,* the physical sensations you describe are strong enough that a purely psychological explanation is unlikely to be the whole story.\n\n\n\n**What you *must* do:**\n\n1. **See a Doctor ASAP:**  Do *not* delay.  A general practitioner is a good starting point, but ideally, you need to see a neurologist.  Explain *everything* you've described here in detail.  The more specific you are, the better.  Documenting it (writing it down) can help.\n2. **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):** Your doctor will likely recommend a sleep study. This monitors your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and muscle movements during sleep to help identify any underlying sleep disorders.\n3. **Neurological Examination:**  The neurologist will likely perform a thorough neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and sensory function. Brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) may also be necessary to rule out structural abnormalities.\n4. **Keep a Sleep Diary:** Before your appointment, keep a detailed sleep diary for a week or two.  Record:\n   * Time you go to bed\n   * Time you wake up\n   * How many times you experience these episodes\n   * What the sensations are like each time (be as specific as possible)\n   * Any potential triggers (stress, caffeine, alcohol, etc.)\n   * Any medications you are taking.\n5. **Avoid Triggers:** Try to identify and minimize any potential triggers, such as stress, caffeine, alcohol, or irregular sleep schedules.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Don't self-diagnose:**  It's tempting to look things up online, but this can cause unnecessary anxiety.  Let a medical professional make a diagnosis.\n* **Be open and honest:**  Don\u2019t downplay your symptoms or feel embarrassed to describe them, even if they seem strange.\n\n\n\nI understand you\u2019re likely scared.  These sensations sound frightening.  But knowledge is power, and getting a proper medical evaluation is the most important thing you can do right now.  Please, prioritize your health and schedule an appointment with a doctor.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "24F In less than a month, 5\u20194\u201d, 114 lb, white. Marina, and occasional Tylenol. 9 months Postpartum, Arthritis, Depression, and Anxiety. No other drugs, or conditions. I\u2019ve been having seizure like things for about 4 months, the Dr\u2019s are confused by the full list of the symptoms, but believe they are seizures. It started with dizziness 6 months ago. So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG\u2019s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I\u2019m scared.. I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.) And I\u2019m slowly getting more permanent symptoms like a slight stutter, memory issues, and difficulty finding words. Example A, I didn\u2019t have any \u201cepisodes\u201d yesterday, but couldn\u2019t get the word bacon out, and then I forgot the word entirely. I have also forgotten pumping out more milk than usual for baby, and thought I had nothing. Apparently I was extremely exited. I\u2019m not expecting a diagnosis, just any information would be lovely. Also anything your patients did to pass the time would be nice. Other tips for this. Also if you have any ideas of something I should bring up to the Dr\u2019s that they might not be considering as an option.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly frightening, and it's completely understandable that you're scared, especially as a new mom. You're doing the right thing by seeking thorough investigation, and it's good you're proactively gathering information.  Let's break down what you can expect, what else might be considered, and things to help you cope.  I will preface this with the standard disclaimer: **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and discussion only.  You MUST continue working with your medical team.**\n\n**Understanding the Situation - Why This is Complex**\n\nYour symptoms are indeed complex, and the fact that standard EEGs haven't captured anything makes diagnosis challenging. The symptoms *do* sound seizure-like, but the fact that you maintain consciousness and have that detailed sensory awareness *during* them is unusual for many classic seizure types.  This is why the long-term EEG monitoring is so crucial \u2013 to try to capture an event while recording brain activity.  The fact they are happening in clusters, and triggered by activity, is also important information.\n\n\n\n**What to Expect During the 5-Day EEG Monitoring**\n\n*   **Preparation:**  You'll likely have electrodes (small metal discs) glued to your scalp with a paste.  A cap with the electrodes pre-set is sometimes used.  They need to stay on for the entire 5 days. You'll need to wash your hair before, and *definitely* avoid using conditioners, hairspray, or anything oily, as it interferes with the glue.\n*   **Monitoring:** You'll be in a hospital setting. You will be asked to keep a log, and press a button when you feel the symptoms starting.  This is crucial, even if it doesn't *look* like a seizure to an outside observer. They want to correlate your subjective experience with the brainwave activity.\n* **Video Recording:**  A video camera will record you *constantly* during the monitoring. This is critical so the neurologists can see what's happening physically during an event, alongside the EEG data.\n*   **Restrictions:** Expect some restrictions. You\u2019ll likely need to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and possibly certain medications that could interfere with the EEG.  You may also not be able to shower or bathe normally (they\u2019ll give you a sponge bath option).\n*   **Sleep:** They'll want you to try to sleep normally, as seizures often happen during sleep.\n*   **Triggers (If Known):**  If certain activities reliably bring on the episodes, let them know *and* try to replicate them (safely!) during the monitoring, if the doctors agree.  This includes things like caring for your baby, certain movements, or stress.\n*   **Frustration:**  It's possible you\u2019ll feel frustrated if events *don't* happen during the monitoring. Don't be discouraged.  Even a \"normal\" EEG can rule things *out* and guide further investigation.\n\n**What Happens After Epilepsy is Ruled Out (or If the EEG is Non-Diagnostic)?**\n\nIf the 5-day EEG doesn't show clear seizure activity, or if the events are still unclassifiable, the doctors will need to broaden the investigation. Here are some possibilities they might consider:\n\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a diagnosis of exclusion, but it's important to consider. It involves neurological symptoms (like weakness, tremors, or, as in your case, episodes of altered movement and sensation) that are *not* caused by structural damage to the brain, but by problems with how the brain functions and sends signals. It\u2019s often triggered by stress or trauma.\n*   **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Events (PNES):**  Sometimes, episodes can *look* like seizures but are triggered by psychological factors.  PNES are different than FND, but also involve the brain functioning incorrectly instead of having a structural issue.\n*   **Cardiac Issues:**  Sometimes, changes in heart rhythm can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or even brief periods of unresponsiveness. They might do a Holter monitor (a portable ECG) to check your heart rhythm over a longer period.\n*   **Migraine Variants:** Some migraines don't involve head pain but can cause neurological symptoms like dizziness, visual disturbances, and weakness.\n*   **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** This affects blood flow and can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and sometimes brief blackouts.\n*   **Autoimmune Encephalitis:** This is an inflammation of the brain caused by the immune system attacking brain tissue. It's rare, but can cause seizures and other neurological symptoms. (Blood tests would be needed.)\n*   **Neurometabolic Disorders:**  These are rare conditions that affect the brain's metabolism.\n*   **Further Imaging:**  Though previous imaging may be normal, they might repeat an MRI of the brain with different protocols, looking for subtle abnormalities.  Sometimes, a PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography) can provide additional information.\n\n\n\n\n**Things to Bring Up With Your Doctors**\n\n*   **Postpartum Considerations:**  The timing of these episodes 9 months postpartum is significant.  Postpartum neurological complications, while rare, do exist. Be sure your doctors are considering this.\n*   **Arthritis:** While likely unrelated, mention it. Autoimmune conditions can sometimes co-occur.  Are you still taking Marina for the arthritis?\n*    **Detailed Symptom Diary:**  You're already doing this somewhat, but a *very* precise diary with time, duration, preceding events, potential triggers, and all symptoms (even seemingly minor ones) is invaluable.\n*   **The \"Elevator\" Feeling:** This is a very specific and important sensation.  Describe it *exactly* as you do to the doctors.  This detail might point towards a specific neurological pathway being affected.\n*    **Cognitive Changes:** Emphasize the memory issues and difficulty finding words.  These are concerning and need to be documented and investigated.\n*  **Ask About a Neurology Psychologist:**  This is important- they specialize in neurological conditions, and might point toward things like FND or PNES.\n\n\n\n\n**Tips for Passing the Time During Monitoring & Coping**\n\n*   **Books/E-reader:** Essential!\n*   **Music/Headphones:**  For relaxation and distraction.\n*   **Tablet/Laptop (with restrictions):**  Check with the hospital about internet access.\n*   **Comfort Items:**  Pictures of your baby, a favorite blanket, etc.\n*   **Journal:**  Writing down your feelings can be therapeutic.\n*   **Focus on Relaxation:**  Deep breathing exercises, meditation apps, or guided imagery can help manage anxiety.\n* **Stay Connected:** Though you're away from your baby, schedule regular video calls.\n\n\n\n**Important Resources:**\n\n*   **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/) (Even if epilepsy is ruled out, they have good general information about neurological disorders.)\n*   **Functional Neurological Disorder Hope:** [https://www.fndhope.org/](https://www.fndhope.org/)\n*   **Postpartum Support International:** [https://www.postpartum.net/](https://www.postpartum.net/) (For support with postpartum depression and anxiety.)\n\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nYou are being a really good advocate for your health and for your baby's.  This is a stressful situation, and it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. Remember to lean on your support system, be patient with the process, and keep communicating openly with your doctors.  Don't hesitate to ask questions and express your concerns.  \n\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope you get answers soon and find a way to manage these symptoms so you can fully enjoy motherhood.  \n\n\n\n"

        "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation with several layers to unpack. You're right to be questioning the root causes of your difficulties and to be cautious about pursuing treatments that might not address the fundamental issues. Here's a breakdown of who to consult, potential long-term consequences, the likelihood of being \"in the clear\" with epilepsy, and a suggested approach.  I'll try to be thorough while recognizing the financial constraints you mentioned.\n\n**First: Disclaimers**\n\n*   **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.** This is for informational purposes only. This is a complex medical history, and a proper evaluation by qualified professionals is *essential*.\n*   **Self-diagnosis is dangerous.** Don't try to determine this on your own.\n\n\n\n**Who to Consult, and in What Order**\n\nGiven your history, I strongly recommend the following order:\n\n1.  **Neurologist:**  *This should be your first step*.  Despite the normal recent EEG, your history is significant. A neurologist specializing in epilepsy is ideal.  They can:\n    *   **Re-evaluate your seizure history in the context of the normal EEG.** A normal EEG doesn\u2019t *guarantee* you're seizure-free forever. It\u2019s a snapshot in time.  They will want to understand seizure characteristics, frequency, and how long you've been without one.\n    *   **Assess for subclinical epilepsy.**  Sometimes, epilepsy manifests as more subtle cognitive or emotional changes *without* obvious seizures.\n    *   **Discuss the potential for subtle neurological effects from childhood seizures.** Even if you haven\u2019t had seizures in years, early brain development can be impacted.  The neurologist will be best positioned to assess this.\n    *   **Consider imaging (MRI).** Depending on the neurologist\u2019s assessment, they may recommend an MRI of the brain to look for evidence of structural changes \u2013 scarring or subtle damage \u2013 that might relate to your past seizures and/or the head injury.\n    *   **Discuss the impact of Adderall:** ADHD medication can sometimes lower the seizure threshold, and it\u2019s important to clarify if this is a concern for you, even with a normal EEG.\n    *   **Provide a medical perspective on the interplay between PTSD and potential neurological consequences.** A neurologist can help determine if your symptoms are *more likely* neurological or psychological, or a combination.\n\n2.  **Neuropsychological Evaluation:** *After seeing the neurologist.*  This is where things get really helpful. A neuropsychologist is a psychologist specifically trained to assess cognitive functions (memory, attention, executive function, etc.). They can:\n    *   **Develop a thorough profile of your cognitive strengths and weaknesses.**  This is much more detailed than standard psychological testing.\n    *   **Distinguish between cognitive deficits stemming from PTSD, seizure history, the head injury, or a combination.** This is *critical*.  Neuropsych testing is far more sensitive to subtle cognitive impairments than a general assessment.  They can often identify patterns of deficits that point towards specific areas of brain dysfunction.\n    *   **Provide tailored recommendations for rehabilitation or strategies to cope with cognitive challenges.**\n\n3.  **Pain Center (for SGB discussion) - *After Neurologist & Neuropsychologist***:  *Only* after you have a better understanding from the neurologist and neuropsychologist should you consider the Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB). SGB is primarily used for pain conditions, PTSD symptoms (particularly hyperarousal), and certain autonomic disorders. *It won't address underlying neurological damage.*  Knowing the origin of your problems is crucial before pursuing this.\n\n\n\n**Potential Long-Term Consequences of Your Seizure History**\n\nChildhood epilepsy, especially the type you describe (frequent, prolonged seizures affecting the temporal lobe), *can* be associated with:\n\n*   **Memory Impairment:**  The temporal lobe is vital for memory formation.  Repeated seizures in this area can lead to difficulties with forming new memories or recalling past events.\n*   **Attention and Concentration Difficulties:**  Seizures can disrupt attention networks in the brain.\n*   **Emotional Regulation Issues:** The temporal lobe and limbic system (often affected by seizures) play a role in emotional processing. This can contribute to anxiety, depression, and irritability.\n*   **Subtle Language or Learning Difficulties:** While not always obvious, seizures can sometimes impact language abilities or learning.\n*   **Increased Risk of Psychiatric Conditions:** There is a known association between epilepsy and higher rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.  It can be difficult to tease apart whether this is a direct result of the seizures themselves or a secondary effect of the challenges of living with epilepsy.\n\n**Head Injury at 14**\n\nThe head injury is also a factor.  Even a brief loss of consciousness with a cracked helmet *can* have long-term consequences, including:\n\n*   Cognitive slowing\n*   Executive function difficulties (planning, problem-solving)\n*   Increased irritability\n*   Headaches\n*   Post-concussion syndrome (symptoms persisting for weeks, months, or even years).\n\n**How Likely Are You \"In the Clear\" Now?**\n\nThis is the million-dollar question.  A normal EEG is reassuring, *but* it's not a guarantee.  Here's a nuanced view:\n\n*   **Decreased Risk with Time:** The longer you go without seizures, the lower your risk of recurrence.  If you've been seizure-free for many years (and you haven't indicated when they stopped) your risk is significantly reduced.\n*   **Possible \"Silent\" Epilepsy:** Some people with epilepsy have seizures that don't manifest as obvious convulsions. These \"subclinical\" seizures can still impact cognitive function and emotional well-being.\n*   **Brain Changes:** Even if you're not actively seizing, the brain changes caused by childhood epilepsy might persist, contributing to your current symptoms.\n* **Adderall** is sometimes associated with seizure activity, so that needs to be considered in light of your history.\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Considerations**\n\n*   **Start with the Neurologist.** This is the most crucial step. Your primary care physician can write a referral.\n*   **Insurance Pre-Authorization:** Before scheduling any tests (especially MRI or neuropsychological evaluation), check with your insurance company to see what requires pre-authorization.\n*    **Neuropsych testing can be expensive:** See if the neurologist can recommend testing resources that align with your insurance. Some hospitals offer sliding-scale fees for neuropsychological evaluations.\n*   **Be upfront about your financial concerns with providers.** Many doctor's offices have financial counselors who can help you navigate billing and payment options.\n\n\n\n**In Summary**\n\nYou are right to question the source of your difficulties. A thorough evaluation starting with a neurologist, followed by neuropsychological testing, is the best path forward. Avoid pursuing interventions like SGB until you have a clearer understanding of whether your symptoms are primarily PTSD-related or stem from neurological changes.\n\n\n\n**Important:**  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.  Please prioritize scheduling appointments with qualified healthcare professionals.\n\nI wish you the best in getting the answers and support you need. It's commendable that you are proactively seeking solutions and advocating for your health."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *very* important question and you are right to be proactive about this, given your epilepsy and interest in HRT. It's excellent that you're thinking ahead and recognizing potential interactions.  Here's a detailed breakdown of the information, aiming to be thorough and responsible. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Potential Interactions \u2013 Depakote, Keppra & HRT**\n\nYou're correct to be aware that certain anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) *can* interact with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The interactions are complex and depend on various factors, including the specific HRT regimen (estrogen-only vs. estrogen-progesterone combos, route of administration - pills, patches, injections, etc.), the individual's metabolism, and other medications.\n\nLet's address Depakote and Keppra specifically, in relation to HRT:\n\n**1. Depakote (Valproic Acid/Divalproex Sodium) \u2013 The Bigger Concern**\n\n*   **How it Works:** Depakote works by affecting levels of GABA, a neurotransmitter in the brain. It's a broad-spectrum AED, meaning it controls many types of seizures, and is often used for Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) like yours.\n*   **HRT Interaction - Significant:**  Depakote *is* known to have clinically significant interactions with estrogen. **Estrogen can significantly increase Depakote levels in the bloodstream.** This happens because estrogen can inhibit the enzymes (specifically, UGT enzymes) that break down Depakote. Higher Depakote levels can lead to increased side effects, including:\n    *   **Neurological:**  Worsening of tremor, ataxia (loss of coordination), cognitive difficulties, and, crucially, potentially *increased seizure frequency* or changes in seizure type.\n    *   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, and other GI upset.\n    *   **Hepatic (Liver):**  Depakote is metabolized by the liver, and even without HRT, liver function needs monitoring. Higher levels amplify this risk.\n*   **Dosage Adjustments:** If you initiate HRT while on Depakote, your doctor will *almost certainly* need to **carefully monitor your Depakote blood levels** and likely **reduce your Depakote dosage** to maintain therapeutic levels while minimizing side effects.  This adjustment will likely need to be gradual and monitored.\n*   **Progesterone:** The interaction between progesterone and Depakote is less clear, but it might also influence Depakote metabolism.\n*    **Your Dosage:** You're on a relatively high dose of Depakote (2000mg/day).  This makes close monitoring even more critical.\n\n**2. Keppra (Levetiracetam) \u2013 Generally Less Interaction, but Still Important**\n\n*   **How it Works:** Keppra's mechanism is different from Depakote. It works by binding to a specific protein (SV2A) in the brain, which helps to stabilize neuronal excitability.\n*   **HRT Interaction \u2013 Lower Risk, but Consider:**  Keppra is generally considered to have *less* direct interaction with estrogen and progesterone compared to Depakote. However:\n    *   **Indirect Effects:** Hormonal changes *can* alter brain chemistry and potentially, seizure thresholds. While Keppra itself isn\u2019t directly metabolized by the same pathways affected by estrogen, the overall altered hormonal environment could, in theory, subtly affect seizure control.\n    *    **Individual Sensitivity:**  Everyone responds differently. Some people are more sensitive to subtle changes in hormone levels than others.\n    *   **Potential for Mood Changes:** HRT can influence mood, and mood is a known trigger for your seizures.\n\n**3. Your Other Medications & Supplements**\n\n*   **Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium & Vitamin D:** These are generally considered safe in conjunction with both AEDs and HRT, but it\u2019s good to inform your prescribing doctor. Magnesium, in particular, can have mild anticonvulsant properties, but it's unlikely to be a major factor.\n*   **Melatonin:**  Melatonin can improve sleep, *which is great* given your seizure trigger. However, in some individuals, high doses can occasionally affect seizure control. Stick to the 3mg dose you're on, and discuss it with your doctor.\n*   **Adderall:** Adderall (amphetamine) is a stimulant.  It can *lower* the seizure threshold in some people, making seizures more likely. It\u2019s important to manage your Adderall use carefully, and *never* increase the dose without consulting your doctor, especially when starting HRT.  Ensure your doctor knows you take it.\n\n\n\n**Crucial Steps to Take Before and During HRT**\n\n1.  **Endocrinologist & Neurologist Collaboration:** This is *the most important step*.  You *need* a collaborative approach.  Your endocrinologist (the HRT specialist) needs to work *closely* with your neurologist.  They need to communicate about your medications, seizure history, and monitoring plans.\n2.  **Baseline Monitoring:**\n    *   **Depakote Level:** Get a baseline Depakote blood level *before* starting HRT.\n    *   **Liver Function Tests:** Baseline liver function tests (LFTs).\n    *   **Seizure Diary:** Keep a very detailed seizure diary *before* starting HRT to establish your baseline seizure frequency and characteristics.\n3.  **HRT Regimen Selection:** Discuss the best HRT regimen for you *considering* your epilepsy. The route of administration (pills vs. patches vs. injections vs. topical) is important.  Transdermal patches or topical creams *may* result in less fluctuation in estrogen levels and potentially a lower impact on Depakote metabolism than oral estrogen. This is something to discuss with your endocrinologist and neurologist.\n4.  **Close Monitoring During HRT Initiation:**\n    *   **Frequent Depakote Level Checks:** Expect frequent Depakote level checks, especially in the first few months after starting HRT.\n    *   **Seizure Diary (Continued):** Continue meticulous seizure logging.\n    *   **Regular Neurologist Follow-ups:** More frequent visits with your neurologist.\n    *   **Monitor for Side Effects:** Be vigilant about reporting any new or worsening symptoms (neurological, gastrointestinal, mood changes) to both your endocrinologist and neurologist.\n5.  **Dosage Adjustments (Likely):** Be prepared for the possibility of needing Depakote dosage adjustments.  This is not something you should do yourself!\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds incredibly frustrating and distressing. You're experiencing a significant impact on your life, and it's understandable why you're feeling depressed and scared. The fact that your EEG results continue to be normal despite your worsening symptoms *is* a significant issue that needs further exploration. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, what it might be, and what you need to do next, tailored to your situation.  I'll cover a lot here, so please read it all.  **I must reiterate that I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. This is informational and should not replace professional medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding Your Situation \u2013 Why This Is Complex**\n\n* **Normal EEGs Don't Rule Everything Out:**  EEG is a valuable tool, but it's not perfect. Absence seizures *can* sometimes be missed on EEG, especially if they're infrequent *during* the recording, or if the seizure activity is deeper within the brain.  Also, your symptoms sound like they might be *more* than just classic absence seizures.\n* **The Change in Symptoms:** The fact that the initial medication helped, then stopped, and now your condition is worsening, points to something evolving or something *not* fully accounted for.  This is crucial information.\n* **Depression is Understandable:**  Living with unexplained, debilitating symptoms, and feeling dismissed by your doctor is *guaranteed* to lead to depression and anxiety.  This needs to be addressed as a separate, but connected, issue.\n* **The Duration is Key:** Hours-long episodes are unusually long for typical absence seizures.  While absence seizures are typically very brief (seconds), what you're describing sounds more prolonged.\n\n\n\n**What Could Be Going On? Potential Considerations (Beyond Straightforward Absence Epilepsy)**\n\nYour symptoms, *especially* the prolonged duration and the visual distortions, suggest possibilities beyond the standard diagnosis of absence seizures. Here are some things your doctor should consider:\n\n* **Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness:**  These can be more subtle than generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). They involve abnormal activity in a specific part of the brain and can cause altered awareness, strange sensations (like the distorted vision you describe), and a feeling of being \"disconnected.\"  Sometimes these can evolve into other seizure types. A normal EEG doesn't definitively *exclude* focal seizures, especially if the area of the brain is not easily detectable on surface EEG.\n* **Complex Partial Seizures (now often categorized under Focal Seizures):** Similar to the above, but potentially including more automatisms \u2013 repetitive movements you might not be aware of.\n* **Non-Epileptic Event Disorder (formerly known as Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures - PNES):** This is *not* faking.  It\u2019s a neurological condition where symptoms *look* like seizures, but are caused by psychological distress.  The brain is misfiring, but not due to abnormal electrical activity in the same way as epilepsy.  The history of trauma or significant stress can be a factor. *It's VERY important to note this is not a character flaw or \"all in your head,\" it's a real neurological condition that requires a different type of treatment (therapy).*\n* **Migraine with Aura:** Some types of migraine can cause prolonged visual disturbances, a sense of detachment, and sensitivity to light and sound.  While typically associated with headaches, migraines don\u2019t *always* present with head pain.\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND):** This is a broad term that describes neurological symptoms that are real but don't have a clear organic cause (like a lesion on the brain).  Stress, psychological factors, and past trauma can play a role.  FND can manifest in many ways, including symptoms that resemble seizures.\n* **Other Neurological Conditions:** Rarer possibilities include certain autoimmune encephalitis variants (inflammation of the brain), or conditions affecting brain metabolism.\n* **Medication Side Effects:** While less likely, it\u2019s good to review possible side effects of Timonil and Medotrigin, or potential interactions between them.\n\n**What You NEED to Do \u2013 Advocating for Yourself**\n\nYou are absolutely right to be concerned, and you are being dismissed.  Here's how to move forward:\n\n1. **Be Assertive with Your Doctor:** You need to clearly and firmly state that your symptoms are significantly impacting your life, that the medications aren't working, and that you feel your concerns aren't being adequately addressed.  Say: \"I understand my EEGs are normal, but my symptoms are getting worse, and I need us to explore other possibilities.\"  Bring a detailed log of your episodes (date, time, duration, specific symptoms, triggers, post-episode effects).\n2. **Request a Neurology *Specialist*.**  Specifically, ask for a referral to an epileptologist (a neurologist specializing in epilepsy) or a neurologist with expertise in complex seizure disorders.  A general neurologist might not have the necessary specialized knowledge.\n3. **Ask About Extended EEG Monitoring:**  A standard EEG is relatively short.  Request a prolonged EEG monitoring session (24-72 hours, or even longer) *including video monitoring*. This allows doctors to correlate your symptoms with the brain activity and can capture events that might be missed in a shorter recording.  Home EEG monitoring is also now available in some areas.\n4. **MRI with Specific Protocols:**  Ask if a more detailed MRI can be performed.  Specifically, ask about:\n    * **High-Resolution MRI:**  For better detection of subtle brain abnormalities.\n    * **MRI with Epilepsy Protocol:**  Includes sequences specifically designed to identify areas of the brain involved in seizure activity.\n5. **Consider Neuropsychological Testing:** This can assess your cognitive function (memory, attention, processing speed) and help determine if there are any subtle cognitive impairments related to your episodes.\n6. **Mental Health Support:**  Start or continue therapy to address the depression and anxiety.  A therapist can provide coping strategies and support. *Even if* your symptoms are ultimately diagnosed as a functional disorder, therapy is a vital part of treatment.\n7. **Rule Out Other Medical Issues:** Talk to your doctor about getting a general health check-up to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms (e.g., thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies).\n8. **Second Opinion:** Unless you feel very confident in your current doctor, getting a second opinion from another neurologist is a very good idea.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Points to Emphasize to Your Doctor:**\n\n* **The Duration:** \u201cMy episodes last for *hours*, which is unusual for typical absence seizures.\"\n* **The Visual Symptoms:** \u201cThe distorted vision and feeling like I'm in a movie are very prominent.\u201d\n* **The Worsening:** \"My condition is getting significantly worse despite medication.\"\n* **The Impact:** \u201cThese episodes are severely impacting my ability to work, study, and live a normal life.\u201d\n* **The Feeling of Being Dismissed:** \"I feel like my concerns aren't being taken seriously, and I need to find an answer.\"\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **Functional Neurological Disorder Hope:** [https://www.fndhope.org/](https://www.fndhope.org/)\n* **Your national epilepsy organization:** Search online for \"[your country] epilepsy foundation\"\n\n\n\nYou deserve answers and effective treatment. Don't give up on advocating for yourself.  You have a right to be heard and to receive the care you need.  Please keep a detailed record of your symptoms and use this information when communicating with your doctors. I wish you the very best in finding a resolution to this."

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really complex situation, and your frustration is *absolutely* understandable. You've been dealing with this for a decade, are proactive about your health, and yet things are progressing despite standard advice. It's good you're advocating for yourself and seeking more answers. Let's break down potential avenues and what to think about while you wait for your neurologist appointment.  I will preface this with a **disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be substituted for the advice of your physician.**\n\n**Key Takeaways From Your History:**\n\n* **Documented Sinus Pauses:** The loop recorder is *crucial* information.  Pauses of 5-13 seconds are significant and need careful consideration. This isn't 'typical' vasovagal.\n* **Prodrome (Deja Vu/Surreal Feeling):** This is a *very* important clue. Deja vu is often (but not always) associated with temporal lobe activity. It's not typical of simple vasovagal syncope.  The specific quality of this pre-episode feeling carries weight.\n* **Positional Changes:**  The shift from mostly seated events to occurring while lying and standing is concerning. It suggests the mechanism is becoming less reliant on typical vasovagal triggers (like prolonged sitting lowering venous return).\n* **Cyclical Pattern (Period/Stress):** The connection to your menstrual cycle strongly points towards a hormonal component. Even if you *feel* like you\u2019re managing stress well, the physiological stress on the body is real and can impact everything.\n* **Post-Event Symptoms:** The cognitive fog, memory issues, coldness, and GI distress are consistent with *some* forms of altered brain activity, not just prolonged reduced blood flow from vasovagal syncope.\n* **Increasing Frequency:** A worsening trend despite preventative measures is a red flag.\n* **Lack of Clear Trigger:** The fact that you're doing everything 'right' (hydration, movement) and still experiencing this is key.\n\n\n\n**Possible Considerations \u2013 To Discuss with Your Doctors (Neurologist Primarily):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of possibilities, ranging from more likely to less likely, alongside what diagnostic investigations might be considered. I'm splitting these into categories.\n\n**1. Cardiac (Beyond Simple Vasovagal):**\n\n*   **Sinus Node Dysfunction (SND):** Though you\u2019ve been evaluated by cardiologists, a *deeper* dive into SND is warranted given the documented pauses.  Are they consistently initiated the same way? Is there any associated atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia on the loop recorder data?  A formal electrophysiology study (EPS) could be considered to assess the sinus node\u2019s function under different conditions. (Your cardiologist will be the key here.) You rightly question whether it's \"just\" vasovagal if your loop recorder shows consistent pauses.\n*   **Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome (BTS):** Sometimes, pauses are followed by rapid heart rates.  Is that happening in any of your episodes?\n*   **Pacemaker Thresholds:**  If a pacemaker is being considered, the cardiologist should thoroughly assess your heart's response to pacing to determine optimal settings.\n\n\n\n\n**2. Neurological \u2013 High on the Differential Given Your Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE):** This is *absolutely* a reasonable consideration, especially with the deja vu.  Seizures don't always involve convulsions.  TLE can present with subtle symptoms, including altered sensation, cognitive changes, and autonomic disturbances (like changes in heart rate \u2013 the pauses). The fact the pauses *precede* the fainting is interesting \u2013 it could be part of an ictal (seizure) event.\n    *   **Investigations:**\n        *   **Long-Term EEG:** A standard EEG may not capture these events, as they seem intermittent.  A long-term video EEG monitoring is crucial \u2013 ideally, while *attempting to trigger* an episode (more on that below).\n        *   **MRI of the Brain (High Resolution):**  Looking for subtle structural abnormalities in the temporal lobes.\n        *   **Neuropsychological Testing:** To objectively assess your memory and cognitive function.\n*   **Dysautonomia (Beyond Vasovagal):** This is a broad spectrum of disorders affecting the autonomic nervous system.  There are several types. POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) is common, but others could cause bradycardia and fainting. Some forms relate to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n    *   **Investigations:**\n        *   **Tilt Table Test:**  To evaluate blood pressure and heart rate response to positional changes. (May have already been done, but re-evaluation *may* be useful)\n        *   **Autonomic Reflex Testing:** A battery of tests to assess sweating, heart rate variability, and other autonomic functions.\n*  **Migraine Associated Vertigo:** Some migraine sufferers experience aura symptoms that include vertigo, cognitive changes, and even fainting.\n    * **Investigation** Thorough assessment of migraine history, and potentially an MRI\n\n**3. Hormonal/Endocrine:**\n\n*   **Catamenial Epilepsy/Syncope:**  The strong correlation with your menstrual cycle suggests hormonal fluctuations are playing a role.  Estrogen and progesterone levels change significantly throughout the cycle and can affect both the nervous and cardiovascular systems. \n    *   **Investigations:**\n        *   **Hormone Level Monitoring:**  Tracking hormone levels (estrogen, progesterone, cortisol) throughout your cycle, correlated with episode occurrence.\n        *   **Consideration of underlying hormonal imbalances (PCOS, thyroid issues, etc.)**: More thorough endocrine workup\n*   **Adrenal Dysfunction:**  Chronic stress (even if you *feel* managed) can impact adrenal function.\n\n\n\n**What to Do While Waiting for Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   **Detailed Episode Diary:**  *This is vital.*  Record:\n    *   Date/Time\n    *   Precise position (standing, sitting, lying)\n    *   Activities *immediately* before (even seemingly insignificant ones)\n    *   What you ate and drank in the hours leading up to the episode\n    *   Specific details of the prodrome (Deja Vu \u2013 describe it!  How intense? How long? Other sensations?)\n    *   Duration of the pause(s) (from loop recorder data)\n    *   Post-event symptoms (severity, duration)\n    * **Menstrual Cycle Phase**: Crucial given the timing.\n*   **Attempt to \"Trigger\" it (Safely!):** This sounds counterintuitive, but *under safe conditions* (with someone present), try to recreate the circumstances surrounding a recent episode.  This is for your neurologist's potential video EEG monitoring. *Do not do this if you are concerned about serious injury.*\n*   **Review Medications/Supplements:**  List everything you're taking.\n*   **Get Copies of All Records:**  Cardiology reports, loop recorder data, neurology reports from 10 years ago.\n*   **Prepare a \"Problem List\":** A concise, organized summary of your symptoms, history, and what you've already tried, to present to the neurologist.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n*   \"Given the documented sinus pauses and the deja vu prodrome, how likely do you think temporal lobe epilepsy could be?\"\n*   \"What type of EEG monitoring would be most appropriate in my case?\"\n*   \"Can you explain the role of the autonomic nervous system in these episodes?\"\n*   \"What is your opinion on the connection between my menstrual cycle and these events?\"\n\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYou are right to push for more answers.  The fact that standard vasovagal treatment isn't working AND you have concerning findings like the sinus pauses and the unique prodrome tells you something is going on that requires a more thorough investigation. The neurologist is the right specialist to lead that charge. Be patient, advocate for yourself, and bring as much detailed information as possible to your appointment.  Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for a second opinion if you still feel unheard.\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope you find some answers and relief soon.  This is a frustrating situation, and your determination to understand what's happening is admirable."

        "question": " Female, 20, 5\"7\", 250lbs, CaucasianNo drug use, no current medication,For the past 6 years I've been having what I think is sleep paralysis fits, the symptoms are like this:I have a weird feeling before sleeping, I can't describe it but when i feel it i know i'm gonna fall into sleep paralysis. then I can't move anything, i'm aware of of my surroundings, scary ominous aura, and sometimes theres this loud ringing, like so loud I feel it in my head pulsing, then pain in my body like fingers being pushed in my sides, and even i sometimes feel my body...buzzing? or shaking fast i dont know if its happening IRL or just in my sleep, or a part of my brain feels like electricity, its usually painful, but there was one time it felt...kinda not bad...like a brain massage, then it went down my back. I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, wow. That sounds *terrifying* and incredibly disruptive. You've described a really complex set of experiences, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling anxious and foggy, and why you're wondering about seizures. It's also incredibly responsible of you to consider your family's health situation when thinking about medical appointments. Let's break this down, and I'll try to give you as much helpful information as possible, understanding the limitations of not being a medical professional and knowing you can't see a doctor right now.  I will also add a disclaimer at the end.\n\n**First: Let's address the seizure concern.**\n\nYou are right to be concerned about the possibility of seizures, *especially* with the \"brain electric feeling\" you describe.  While your symptoms *sound* a lot like a particularly vivid and intense form of sleep paralysis, that sensation is not typical of *most* sleep paralysis experiences.  However, there are types of seizures that *can* manifest in unusual ways, and can even happen during sleep or the transition between sleep and wakefulness. \n\nHere's why it's good you're thinking about this, and why it needs to be investigated *eventually*:\n\n*   **Focal Seizures:** These seizures start in one area of the brain and can cause a variety of symptoms depending on where the activity is.  Sensations like tingling, buzzing, electrical feelings, unusual body movements (even if you aren't consciously aware of them), and altered perceptions could be part of a focal seizure.\n*   **Nocturnal Seizures:** Some seizures happen primarily at night.  They can be subtle and mistaken for sleep disorders.\n*   **The \"auras\" you describe:** The ominous feeling and ringing could potentially be considered a type of aura, sometimes preceding a seizure.\n\n**However, it\u2019s important to remember:** Many things can cause these sensations, and sleep paralysis can sometimes be *very* intense and have unusual components.  The fact that it's been happening for six years, with bouts of remission, and the link to sleep deprivation leans more towards sleep paralysis... but that electrical sensation is the key thing that warrants careful consideration.\n\n\n\n**Let's look closely at your symptoms and how they align with sleep paralysis *and* what could be other issues:**\n\n*   **Typical Sleep Paralysis:**  The inability to move, awareness of surroundings, scary aura, feeling a presence \u2013 these are hallmarks of sleep paralysis. It happens when your brain wakes up before your body's muscles are 'released' from REM sleep.\n*   **The Pain:**  This is less common in \u201cclassic\u201d sleep paralysis, but definitely reported by many, and can be quite frightening. The sensation of pressure, being pushed, or buzzing can occur.\n*   **Body Vibration/Shaking/Electric Feeling:** This is less typical, but *can* happen. The brain is still partially asleep and misinterpreting sensory information.  This is where the seizure concern comes in.\n*   **Out-of-Body Experience/Floating:** This is reported in sleep paralysis, often linked to the disorienting state between wakefulness and sleep.\n*   **Voices/Growling/Sounds:** Hypnagogic (falling asleep) and hypnopompic (waking up) hallucinations, including auditory ones, are common in sleep paralysis.\n*   **Mouth Moving:**  This could be muscle twitching while paralyzed, or a sensation *feeling* like movement.\n*   **Feeling of Spiraling:** This suggests a strong sense of anxiety and dissociation during the episode.\n*   **Post-Episode Fatigue/Fog:**  Very common.  Your brain and body have been through a stressful experience.\n*   **Triggered by Sleep Deprivation:** This is a major factor for many people with sleep paralysis.\n*   **Side Sleeping & Suspected Sleep Apnea:**  Side sleeping is generally good for sleep apnea. Elevating your head is also a helpful strategy. Sleep apnea *can* disrupt sleep and potentially worsen sleep paralysis.\n\n\n\n**What can you do *right now*, given your constraints?**\n\nThis is a tough situation, but here's a prioritized list of things you can try:\n\n1.  **Sleep Hygiene \u2013 Make It a Non-Negotiable:** This is the most important thing *you* control right now. Even though it's hard, prioritize consistent sleep.\n    *   **Strict Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the *same time* every day, even on weekends, as much as possible.  This will be your biggest help to regulate your body.\n    *   **Dark, Quiet, Cool Room:** Optimize your sleep environment.\n    *   **Avoid Screens Before Bed:**  Blue light interferes with melatonin.\n    *   **Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing exercises, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or a warm (not hot!) bath before bed can help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** Especially in the afternoons and evenings.\n    *  **Diet:** avoid eating heavy meals before bed.\n2. **Document Everything.** Keep a detailed sleep diary.  This is *crucial*.\n    *   **Date and Time of Episodes:**\n    *   **What happened before?** (Stress levels, day\u2019s activities, sleep deprivation, last meal, etc.)\n    *   **Detailed Description of the Episode:**  Write down *everything* you experience, even if it seems insignificant. Pay special attention to the \"electric feeling\" \u2013 where exactly do you feel it, what does it feel like, how long does it last?\n    *   **What did you feel *after*?** (Fatigue levels, mood, pain). This diary will be invaluable when you *can* see a doctor.\n3.  **Explore Relaxation Techniques During Episodes (Difficult, But Potentially Helpful):**  When you feel an episode starting (or are in one), try to *remind yourself* it's sleep paralysis.  Focus on trying to wiggle a finger or toe (even if it feels impossible). Focusing on small movements can sometimes help break the paralysis.  Deep, slow breaths can also help ground you.\n4. **Address Potential Sleep Apnea:** Since you suspect sleep apnea, minimizing factors that worsen it is important. Continue sleeping on your side and elevated.  (Do *not* self-treat sleep apnea, but awareness is good.)\n5. **Look for Low-Cost/Free Telehealth Options:**  I know you said you can't go to a doctor right now, but some organizations offer free or low-cost telehealth services.  Look for community health clinics or non-profits in your area. Even a phone consultation can be helpful.\n\n\n**Regarding the \u201cbrain electric feeling\u201d \u2013 please, PLEASE, when you are able to access medical care, make this your top priority to discuss with a doctor, ideally a neurologist.**\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  Your symptoms warrant investigation by a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions, including seizures. The fact you cannot access care immediately is unfortunate, but please prioritize this when it becomes possible.\n\n\nI hope this is helpful.  You're doing the right thing by trying to understand what's happening and by seeking information.  Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself. This is a really difficult thing to live with, and you're being incredibly strong by managing it as best you can."

        "question": "Male 18 75kg 6ft black I started having these episodes last December. So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went.. I can remember bits of the previous week but it's not all there..I came out of the crash uninjured and same with the family.I take no medication I drink and social smoke like every 2 weeks with my friends.Had a panicked attack at work Thursday and had to go home cause I started crying thinking I have a tumor in my brain or epilepsy or something...and a friend suggested it could be an aura epilepsy..",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack, and you're right to be concerned and seek information. It's excellent that you're being proactive about figuring this out. Your friend's suggestion of aura epilepsy is *one* possibility, but there are many things it could be, and self-diagnosing is never a good idea. Here's a breakdown of your symptoms, what they *could* suggest, and **why you need to see a doctor ASAP**.  This is not a substitute for medical advice.\n\n**Let's break down your experiences:**\n\n* **Episodes 1: Short, Recurring Episodes with D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu & Lost Memory** (December - present): These sound like what are often called **complex partial seizures**. Here's why, and what fits:\n    * **D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu:**  A common aura (warning sign) associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.\n    * **Headache & Dizziness:** Can accompany seizures.  The dizziness can be post-ictal (after the seizure), a common effect.\n    * **Trigger by a Normal Activity:** Seizures can be triggered by everyday things.\n    * **Specific Memory Association (that you then forget):** This is significant. The repetition of the same memory content being brought up suggests a focus in a specific area of your brain.  The fact you *forget* the memory itself is typical of complex partial seizures \u2013 awareness is altered but not completely lost.\n    * **Short Duration (5-10 seconds):** Aligns with many seizure types.\n* **Episodes 2: Prolonged Dizziness, Nausea, & Altered Awareness/Recognition** (May, and post-crash): These episodes are more concerning and suggest something potentially more impactful going on.  The following points stand out:\n    * **Dazed Feeling:** Often described with post-ictal states but also with other neurological issues.\n    * **Nausea:** Can be a symptom of neurological events.\n    * **Unfamiliarity with People/Environment:**  This is *very* significant. Not recognizing a coworker then, experiencing memory loss post-crash, suggests disruption of memory encoding and retrieval.\n    * **Transient Nature & Napping Relief:** While seeming to improve with rest, this doesn't rule out a serious cause. It could be masking the full impact.\n* **Crash & Memory Loss:**  This is the most critical event.\n    * **Retrograde Amnesia:** Losing memory of the *week before* the crash is **retrograde amnesia**, a significant neurological symptom.  This suggests trauma *or* an underlying condition that was exacerbated by the stress/trauma of the accident.\n    * **Fragmentary Recall:** Remembering bits and pieces, but not a continuous narrative, is common in amnesia.\n    * **5 Second Recall in Ambulance:** Suggests a brief moment of clarity amidst the confusion.\n\n\n\n**Why Your Friend's Suggestion of 'Aura Epilepsy' is plausible, but incomplete:**\n\nYour friend is right to suggest epilepsy, *specifically temporal lobe epilepsy*. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, brief periods of altered awareness, and potential for memory disturbance are hallmarks. *However*, the episodes described after May, and especially the memory loss after the crash, raise concerns beyond a simple seizure disorder.  There are a few key possibilities to consider:\n\n* **Post-Concussion Syndrome:**  Even without a visible head injury, the crash could have caused a concussion. Post-concussion syndrome can manifest as dizziness, memory problems, headaches, and cognitive difficulties.  Amnesia right after a concussion can occur.\n* **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):** If there was any impact to the head, it's possible you experienced a mild TBI. Regardless, a brain scan would be needed to rule this out.\n* **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** Induced by extreme stress and anxiety; these appear like seizures but aren\u2019t caused by abnormal electrical activity.\n* **Underlying Neurological Condition:**  While less likely given your age and health history, there's a possibility of an underlying condition that was triggered or exacerbated by the crash, such as:\n    * **Migraine with Aura:** Though typically associated with visual disturbances, auras can manifest in other ways, including altered sensations and even memory problems.\n    * **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) - \"Mini-Stroke\":** While less common in young adults, it's a possibility, especially if there are risk factors (though you don't mention any).\n    * **Rare Neurological Conditions:** There are rarer conditions that can present with these symptoms, which is why a thorough investigation is needed.\n\n**What You *Must* Do Immediately:**\n\n1. **SEE A DOCTOR \u2013 URGENTLY.**  Do not wait.  This is not something to \"watch and see.\" Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician *immediately* and explain *all* of these symptoms in detail. Be as specific as possible about the timing, duration, and what you experience during each episode. Tell them you are experiencing memory issues and dizziness.\n2. **Neurological Evaluation:** Your primary care physician will almost certainly refer you to a **neurologist**.  The neurologist will likely request the following:\n    * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):**  To measure brainwave activity and look for signs of seizures.  (This may include an ambulatory EEG, where you wear the device for a longer period to capture events that happen infrequently).\n    * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain:**  To look for any structural abnormalities, damage from the crash, or evidence of other neurological issues.\n    * **Cognitive Testing:** To assess your memory, attention, and other cognitive functions.\n    * **Detailed Neurological Exam:** To test reflexes, coordination, and other neurological functions.\n3. **Be Honest about Substance Use:** While you say you only drink and smoke socially, be upfront with your doctor about the frequency and amount. While not the likely cause, it's important to provide a complete picture.\n4. **Keep a Symptom Diary:** Before your appointment, start keeping a detailed diary of your episodes. Note:\n    * Date and Time\n    * What you were doing before the episode\n    * What you experienced *during* the episode (sensations, thoughts, feelings)\n    * How long the episode lasted\n    * What happened *after* the episode\n    * Any potential triggers (stress, lack of sleep, certain foods, etc.)\n\n**Regarding your anxiety:**\n\nIt's COMPLETELY understandable that you're terrified of a brain tumor or epilepsy.  These are frightening possibilities. But rushing to the worst-case scenario won't help.  Getting a proper diagnosis is the best way to address your fears. The anxiety itself can also worsen your symptoms, so addressing it with coping strategies (and possibly therapy) will be important, *after* you get a medical evaluation.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

The sooner you get this checked out, the sooner you can get a diagnosis and a plan to manage your symptoms."

        "question": " I am 30F, 5'1\", 110lbs, caucasian. I have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and I take Synthroid 88mcg/daily. I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and it's good you've already done a lot of preliminary investigation with doctors. The fact that you've had this pattern since your teens, both in-flight *and* on land, plus the specific pre-faint symptoms (dizziness, heat, clamminess, ringing ears) points away from a simple \"sometimes girls faint\" explanation. And the fact that standard tests are normal is frustrating, but also helpful \u2013 it narrows down the possibilities. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what might be happening, potential things to explore, and very specific things to try for your upcoming flight.  **Disclaimer: I am an AI chatbot, not a medical professional. This is for informational purposes only and doesn't constitute medical advice. You *must* discuss this with your doctor before making any changes to your health plan.**\n\n**Understanding What's Likely Going On (Possibilities to Discuss with Your Doctor):**\n\n* **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is the most common type of fainting, and it *seems* like a strong contender here, *but* the frequency and in-flight specifics suggest it\u2019s likely nuanced. It's triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, often in response to emotional stress, pain, the sight of blood, or prolonged standing.  However, airplane travel adds layers. The key here is that *changes* in pressure/stimulation can easily trigger it.\n* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** While your cardiologist ruled out heart problems, *specifically* POTS sometimes evades easy detection.  POTS involves an abnormal increase in heart rate upon standing or even just sitting up, with accompanying symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, and sometimes fainting.  Airplane conditions (dehydration, prolonged sitting, low cabin pressure) can *significantly* exacerbate POTS. It's *worth* a second discussion with your cardiologist and potentially a \"tilt table test\" if you haven't had one.\n* **Hypothyroidism & Blood Pressure/Regulation:**  While you\u2019re being treated for Hashimoto\u2019s, even well-managed hypothyroidism can still *impact* blood pressure regulation and autonomic nervous system function. It's worth discussing with your endocrinologist if your Synthroid dosage is absolutely optimal, and if subtle fluctuations could be contributing. Your TSH, T4, and T3 levels should be closely monitored.\n* **Autonomic Dysfunction:**  This is a broader category. Your autonomic nervous system controls things like heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and digestion.  If it's not functioning properly, even mildly, it can lead to fainting.  The episodic nature of your fainting and the specific symptoms align with this.  It can develop as a secondary condition to other illnesses (like Hashimoto's) or sometimes be idiopathic (no known cause).\n* **Neurocardiogenic Syncope (NCS):**  This is very similar to vasovagal syncope but involves a more complex interaction between the heart and brain.\n* **Situational Syncope with a strong trigger:** It could be a specific combination of factors on planes (cabin pressure change, low humidity, subtle vibrations, the feeling of being confined) that act as a consistent trigger, rather than one single thing.\n\n\n\n**Specific Advice for Your 14-Hour Flight (and beyond - building a plan):**\n\n**1. Pre-Flight Preparation (Important!):**\n\n*   **Maximize Hydration *Before* You Go:**  Start *several days* before your flight. Don't just chug water the day of. Aim for consistent, good hydration.  Electrolyte drinks (like Liquid I.V., Nuun, or even a pinch of salt in your water) in the days leading up to the flight are helpful.\n*   **Salt Loading (Controlled):**  You\u2019re already doing salt tablets which is good. Consider increasing this slightly *gradually* in the 2-3 days leading up to the flight, but be mindful of your blood pressure. Don't overdo it. Focus on salty snacks as well (pretzels, salted nuts).  Discuss optimal amount with your GP.\n*  **Iron Levels:** Low iron can exacerbate fainting tendencies. Get your ferritin (iron stores) checked.\n*   **Discuss with your Doctor:** Very important. Tell them about your plan (increased hydration/salt, etc.).  They may suggest a small increase in Synthroid dosage for the travel period (this MUST be under their guidance).\n* **Medication Timing:** Take your Synthroid at your usual time, but discuss with your doctor if it\u2019s beneficial to adjust anything else related to your medication schedule.\n\n\n\n\n**2. During the Flight \u2013 A Multi-Pronged Approach:**\n\nThis is where you need to be proactive and meticulous.\n\n*   **Seat Choice:**  Aisle seat is ideal for quicker access if you feel unwell.  Request a seat near the front of the plane (cabin pressure is slightly more stable there) if possible, but avoid the very front row where you can\u2019t stretch your legs.\n*   **Hydration, Hydration, Hydration:** Continue with the 64oz (or more, if comfortable) of water. Sip consistently, don't gulp.  Alternate with electrolyte drinks.\n*   **Salt Intake:**  Continue with the salt tablets.\n*   **Compression Socks:** Excellent. Ensure they\u2019re properly fitted.\n*   **Regular Movement:**  This is CRITICAL. Set an alarm for every 30-60 minutes to get up and walk the aisle (even just a few steps).  If you can't get up, do ankle pumps and calf raises in your seat. This helps with circulation.\n*   **Breathing Exercises:**  Practice deep, slow breathing exercises (diaphragmatic breathing) throughout the flight. This can help regulate your nervous system.\n*   **Snacks:**  Continue eating small, frequent salty snacks. Avoid large, heavy meals.\n*   **Avoid Crossing Legs:**  This can impede blood flow.\n*   **Ear Protection:** The ringing ears are a sign of potential inner ear/pressure changes contributing to the issue. Consider earplugs designed for flight to equalize pressure gradually.\n* **Temperature & Airflow:** Direct the overhead air vent towards your face.\n*   **Tell the Flight Attendants:**  *Before* the flight even takes off, discreetly inform a flight attendant about your history.  Let them know your symptoms and what to do if you start to feel unwell (you'll give them a card with this info \u2013 see below).\n*   **\"Medical Alert\" Card:** Create a small card you can hand to the flight attendant.  It should say:\n    *   \u201cI have a history of fainting (syncope). Symptoms include dizziness, heat, clamminess, and ringing in the ears.\u201d\n    *   \u201cIf I begin to feel unwell, please offer water/juice and notify the captain to slightly lower the cabin temperature.\u201d\n    *   \"If I lose consciousness, please perform a sternum rub to help wake me.\"\n    *   Your name, emergency contact, and any allergies.\n\n\n\n**3.  Post-Flight:**\n\n*   **Take it Easy:**  Don't schedule anything strenuous immediately after the flight.  Allow yourself time to recover.\n*   **Continue Hydration & Salt:** This isn\u2019t over when you land!\n\n\n\n**Further Investigation (Talk to your Doctors about):**\n\n*   **Repeat Tilt Table Test:** If you haven\u2019t had one, or it was done a while ago, a repeat test is worth considering.\n*   **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring:**  Wear a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours to see how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day.\n*   **Autonomic Testing:**  There are more specialized tests to assess autonomic function. Your neurologist might be able to refer you to someone.\n* **Consider a referral to a dysautonomia specialist.** These doctors specialize in disorders of the autonomic nervous system.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Anxiety:**  Your anxiety about flying is likely exacerbating the problem.  Consider talking to a therapist about coping mechanisms for flight anxiety.\n* **Medication Adjustments:** Never modify your Synthroid dosage without strictly following your endocrinologist's guidance.\n\n\n\nYou are being proactive and responsible in trying to address this. The key is to meticulously explore the possibilities with your medical team and create a detailed plan for your flight to give yourself the best chance of a safe and comfortable journey.  Good luck! I hope this helps."

        "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a *really* complex situation, and it's incredibly frustrating that you're not being heard by your doctors. You're right to feel this way. Your history is nuanced, and dismissing it as simply \"weight gain causing fatigue\" is both short-sighted and potentially harmful. Let's break down the various aspects and potential avenues to explore.  I'll aim to provide a thoughtful, detailed response, and then offer some suggestions for next steps.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**\n\n**Understanding the Complexity: Your History & Potential Connections**\n\nYou've described a dramatic shift with several key elements that *could* be interconnected. It's *not* a simple equation. Here's how I see the pieces fitting (and where the uncertainty lies):\n\n* **Pre-Epilepsy \u2013 Intense Activity & Weight Loss:** Losing 65lbs through focused exercise is a *significant* physiological change. It's not just about weight; it impacts hormones, metabolism, gut microbiome, and immune function.  Pushing your body hard like that (1-1.5 hr gym + 20-mile hikes) is also a stressor, even positive stress.  While generally good, it can sometimes uncover pre-existing vulnerabilities.\n* **The Seizure & Its Aftermath:** This is the pivotal event. A seizure isn't just an electrical event in the brain; it\u2019s a systemic shock. It impacts energy metabolism, can cause subtle brain injury (even if not visible on immediate imaging), and triggers an inflammatory response.  The loss of your career and license is a *huge* stressor adding another layer of trauma.\n* **Post-Seizure Fatigue & Exercise Intolerance:** This is your central complaint, and it's a legitimate symptom that deserves investigation. The sudden inability to perform at your previous level, even with minimal exertion, is a red flag.\n* **Keppra (Levetiracetam) & Side Effects:** Keppra *can* cause fatigue and mood changes. However, you've rightly observed that others on Keppra on r/epilepsy don't report the same severity.  Side effects are highly individual.\n* **Weight Regain:** This is a consequence of the fatigue and loss of ability to exercise. It's a secondary issue, and treating it as *the* problem misses the point.\n* **Doctors' Dismissal:** Sadly, this is common.  Many doctors operate under time constraints and can fall into pattern recognition, particularly with weight.  It's easier to attribute symptoms to weight than to investigate complex underlying causes.\n\n\n\n**Let's address your question: \"Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?\"**\n\nThis is a very valid question, and the answer is: *potentially*.  Here's why:\n\n* **Autoimmune Epilepsy:** There are recognized forms of epilepsy that are autoimmune in origin.  These are often (but not always) associated with specific antibodies that attack the brain.  These tend to be more resistant to typical anti-epileptic drugs.\n* **Seizures as a Symptom of Systemic Autoimmunity:** Sometimes, seizures aren't the *primary* autoimmune problem, but a symptom of a broader autoimmune process affecting the nervous system. Conditions like Lupus, Vasculitis, and certain types of Multiple Sclerosis can sometimes manifest with seizures.\n* **Gut-Brain Connection & Autoimmunity (Leaky Gut):** This is where your research is spot-on.  The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in immune regulation. \"Leaky gut\" (increased intestinal permeability) can allow bacterial components to enter the bloodstream, triggering an immune response. Chronic inflammation stemming from gut dysbiosis can contribute to both neurological and autoimmune issues.  There's growing evidence linking gut health to epilepsy.  It's not a simple cause/effect, but a complex interaction.\n* **Inflammation & Epilepsy:**  The brain is very sensitive to inflammation.  Even subtle, chronic inflammation can lower the seizure threshold and contribute to fatigue.\n* **The Pre-Seizure Weight Loss:** Rapid weight loss can impact gut health.  Drastic diet changes can alter the microbiome, potentially contributing to inflammation.\n\n**Possible Contributing Factors and Areas to Investigate**\n\n* **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Seizures are incredibly energy-demanding. Mitochondrial dysfunction (problems with energy production within cells) can be a factor in both seizures and post-seizure fatigue.  It\u2019s often overlooked.\n* **Hormonal Imbalance:**  Significant weight loss and stress can disrupt hormone levels (thyroid, cortisol, sex hormones). Imbalances can cause fatigue, mood changes, and cognitive issues.\n* **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Especially if your diet was restrictive during weight loss, you might have developed deficiencies in essential nutrients (magnesium, Vitamin D, B vitamins, etc.).\n* **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):**  This is a relatively newly recognized condition where mast cells (immune cells) inappropriately release mediators, causing widespread inflammation and various symptoms, including neurological ones, and fatigue.   It can be associated with gut issues.\n* **Post-Infectious Autoimmunity:** Sometimes, a prior infection (even a seemingly mild one) can trigger an autoimmune response.\n\n\n\n**What to Do Now: Advocating for Yourself**\n\nYou *need* a doctor who will listen and investigate.  Here's a strategy:\n\n1. **Find a Different Neurologist:** Seriously. A neurologist who dismisses your concerns isn\u2019t helping you.  Look for one specializing in *epilepsy and autoimmune neurology*.  (See resources at the end).\n2. **Detailed Symptom Journal:** Keep a very detailed log of:\n    *   Fatigue levels (scale of 1-10)\n    *   Activities and how they affect your energy\n    *   Diet (everything you eat and drink)\n    *   Sleep quality\n    *   Mood\n    *   Any other symptoms (digestive issues, skin problems, etc.)\n3. **Prepare a Comprehensive History:**  Write down everything, including your pre-epilepsy fitness, the seizure event, the job loss, and how your symptoms have evolved *over time*.  Don't downplay anything.\n4. **Request Specific Tests (Advocate for these):** This is where you need to be assertive.  Ask about:\n    *   **Autoimmune Epilepsy Panel:**  Tests for specific antibodies associated with autoimmune epilepsy.\n    *   **Comprehensive Inflammation Markers:**  ESR, CRP, and more sensitive markers like IL-6, TNF-alpha, and VEGF.\n    *   **Vitamin D & B12 Levels:**  To rule out deficiencies.\n    *   **Thyroid Panel:**  TSH, Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibodies.\n    *   **Gut Health Testing:** Consider a comprehensive stool analysis (with a functional medicine doctor \u2013 see below).\n    *   **Mitochondrial Function Testing:** While not widely available, it's worth asking about.\n    * **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) Workup:** Testing for tryptase and other mast cell mediators.\n5. **Consider Functional Medicine:** A functional medicine doctor focuses on finding the *root cause* of illness. They are often more open to exploring gut health, autoimmunity, and individualized treatment plans. You can find one through the Institute for Functional Medicine website.   **Important:**  Functional medicine should *complement*, not replace, conventional medical care.\n6. **Don't Give Up:** It may take time and multiple doctors to find someone who understands your situation.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Epilepsy Foundation:** [https://www.epilepsy.com/](https://www.epilepsy.com/)\n* **Autoimmune Brain Disorders Association:** [https://autoimmunebrain.org/](https://autoimmunebrain.org/)\n* **Institute for Functional Medicine:** [https://www.ifm.org/](https://www.ifm.org/) (Find a Practitioner)\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very concerning situation, and you're right to be seeking neurological evaluation. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, potential causes, and what to expect as you move forward, geared towards helping you understand and communicate with your neurologist.  I will *clearly state* I am *not* a doctor and this is not medical advice. This is information for your understanding and discussion with your healthcare team.\n\n**Summarizing Your Symptoms:**\n\n* **Initial Event (Post-Laughing Gas):**  A significant and prolonged reaction to nitrous oxide, including difficulty walking/talking, lasting hours.\n* **\"Episode\" (Day After):**  Sudden onset of nausea, confusion, difficulty with thought processing and motor coordination, involuntary movements, hyperventilation, and a period of immobility/inability to speak.  Witnesses described behavior consistent with a seizure, though the ER workup was negative.\n* **Daily \"Freezing\" Episodes:** Brief periods of immobility, speech arrest, and altered awareness (feeling \"blank,\" \"stuck,\" \"removed from reality\").  Sometimes accompanied by weakness or an \"aura.\"\n* **Processing Difficulty:**  A noticeable lag in understanding speech, suggesting cognitive slowing.\n* **No Prior History:** No previous anxiety, panic attacks, or neurological conditions in yourself or family.\n\n\n\n**Possible Explanations \u2013 What Your Neurologist Will Be Considering:**\n\nGiven the timing and your symptoms, here are potential explanations. *These are possibilities, not diagnoses.*\n\n1. **Post-Anesthetic/Nitrous Oxide Complications:**  This is a strong consideration, given the direct temporal link.  Though rare, nitrous oxide can have delayed neurological effects.\n    * **Delayed Neurological Effects:**  It\u2019s possible the initial exposure triggered a cascade of events that are still unfolding.\n    * **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:**  Prolonged or repeated exposure to nitrous oxide can interfere with Vitamin B12 absorption.  Severe B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (which can cause weakness, numbness, and balance problems).  This is something commonly checked after nitrous oxide exposure.\n    * **Wernicke's Encephalopathy:**  Rare, but possible with nitrous oxide exposure, particularly if there's underlying thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency.  Presents with confusion, ataxia (difficulty with coordination), and ophthalmoplegia (eye movement problems).\n\n2. **Non-Epileptic Events (Functional Neurological Disorder - FND):**  The description of your initial episode *could* fit with a non-epileptic event.  These events look like seizures, but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  They're often linked to psychological stress or trauma, but can also happen without an obvious trigger. You mention you have no history of anxiety, but sometimes stress manifests in physical ways.  Important to note: This is *not* saying it's \"all in your head.\" FND is a real and recognized neurological condition.\n\n3. **Subtle Seizure Activity:**  While the initial ER testing was normal, some types of seizures don\u2019t reliably show up on a single EEG or CT scan.  \n   * **Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness:**  These can cause altered awareness, staring, and seemingly automatic behaviors, sometimes with brief immobility.  \n   * **Intermittent Lapses:**  The \"freezing\" episodes could be subtle focal seizures.\n\n4. **Migraine with Aura:**  While you don't report headache, some migraines present with neurological symptoms *without* significant head pain (silent migraine). The \u201caura\u201d sensation you describe could be migraine-related.\n\n5. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) / Stroke:** Less likely given your age and clear ER results, but the neurologist will consider this, particularly if there are any risk factors (though you haven't mentioned any).\n\n6. **Other Neurological Conditions:** (Less Likely, but need to be ruled out)\n    * **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):**  While your symptoms don\u2019t definitively point to MS, the \u201cfreezing\u201d and neurological symptoms warrant investigation.\n    * **Autoimmune Encephalitis:**  A rare condition where the immune system attacks the brain.\n\n\n\n**What to Expect at Your Neurology Appointment (and How to Prepare):**\n\n* **Detailed History:** The neurologist will spend a significant amount of time taking your history. Be *very* specific and detailed.  Bring:\n    * **A written timeline:**  Write down everything that happened from the day of the dental procedure to the present, including the timing of each \"freezing\" episode.\n    * **A list of all your symptoms.**\n    * **A list of any medications you take,** even over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n* **Neurological Exam:** This will assess your reflexes, strength, coordination, sensation, and cognitive function.\n* **Testing:**\n    * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):**  To measure electrical activity in the brain.  May be done with video monitoring to try to capture an event.  A normal EEG does *not* rule out all types of seizures.\n    * **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  Provides a more detailed view of the brain than a CT scan.\n    * **Blood Tests:** Including:\n        * **Vitamin B12 level.**\n        * **Thiamine (Vitamin B1) level.**\n        * **Complete Blood Count (CBC), electrolytes, kidney and liver function.**\n        * **Autoimmune panel** to rule out autoimmune encephalitis.\n    * **Possibly a prolonged EEG monitoring** if initial EEG is normal.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Neurologist:**\n\n* \"Given the timing of my symptoms in relation to the nitrous oxide, how likely is this to be the cause?  What further testing would help determine that?\"\n* \"What are the chances this could be a form of seizure disorder, even if the initial EEG was normal?\"\n* \"If it\u2019s not a seizure, what other possibilities are you considering?\"\n* \u201cCould my symptoms be related to a neurological effect of the laughing gas, even if traditional tests come back normal?\u201d\n* \"What is the next step in the diagnostic process?\"\n* \"Are there any lifestyle changes I should make in the meantime?\"\n\n**Things You Can Do Now:**\n\n* **Avoid Nitrous Oxide:** Absolutely no more nitrous oxide until cleared by a doctor.\n* **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water.\n* **Prioritize Sleep:**  Get adequate rest.\n* **Avoid Alcohol and Recreational Drugs.**\n* **Keep a Symptom Diary:**  Record the date, time, duration, and any triggers for your \"freezing\" episodes and processing difficulties.  \n\n\n\n**Crucially:** You are advocating for your health. Don't be afraid to be persistent with your concerns and questions. The fact that your symptoms started *after* the laughing gas exposure is a very important clue. Your neurologist will work to rule out possibilities and arrive at a diagnosis.  \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really important question and it's great you're proactively trying to understand this. You're right to wonder about potential connections between your birth experience and your current health. Let's break down the possibilities, what birth asphyxia can do, and what it might mean for you. **Please read the disclaimer at the end - I am an AI and this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding Your Situation \u2013 What Your Parents Described**\n\nWhat your parents described sounds very concerning and strongly suggests *perinatal asphyxia*, which is a broader term for oxygen deprivation around the time of birth. The \"cooling\" techniques (therapeutic hypothermia) are *specifically* used to reduce brain damage after asphyxia.  C-sections are sometimes performed *because* of fetal distress (lack of oxygen) or as a rapid response to it.  That they used a monitor for weeks suggests they were watching for neurological issues.  This wasn't a typical, easy delivery.\n\n**What Happens During Birth Asphyxia?**\n\nDuring birth asphyxia, the baby's brain doesn't get enough oxygen. This can lead to a cascade of problems:\n\n*   **Brain Damage:** The brain is *very* sensitive to oxygen deprivation. Damage can range from mild to severe, affecting different areas.\n*   **Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE):** This is the medical term for brain damage caused by oxygen lack and reduced blood flow.  The cooling methods your parents mentioned are aimed at lessening the impact of HIE.\n*   **Multi-Organ System Involvement:** Lack of oxygen doesn't just impact the brain. It can affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, and intestines.\n\n**Long-Term Consequences of Birth Asphyxia \u2013 And Your Concerns**\n\nYou are right to question if your experiences are connected. Here's a look at possible connections:\n\n*   **Neurodevelopmental Issues (ADHD/ADD):**  This is a *strong* possibility. Brain injury from asphyxia, especially if it affected the frontal lobes (involved in executive functions like attention, impulse control, and planning), can significantly increase the risk of ADHD or ADD.  It's not a simple cause-and-effect, but it's a well-documented association. Research has shown a link between perinatal hypoxia and increased vulnerability for neurodevelopmental disorders.\n*   **Photosensitivity/Visual Sensitivity:**  This is also plausibly linked.  Asphyxia can affect the development of the visual pathways and the brain's processing of visual information.  This can manifest as sensitivity to bright or flashing lights (photosensitivity), sometimes resembling mild seizure activity, potentially becoming outright seizures.\n*   **Seizures:** You specifically asked about this. Seizures *are* a known potential complication of birth asphyxia, both in the immediate newborn period and later in life.  They can be subtle or more dramatic. It\u2019s important to note not everyone with birth asphyxia develops seizures.\n*   **Other Potential Issues:** Depending on the severity and location of any brain damage, other possible long-term issues could include:\n    *   Learning difficulties\n    *   Motor skill deficits (coordination, muscle control)\n    *   Speech and language delays\n    *   Emotional regulation difficulties\n    *   Intellectual disability (in severe cases)\n\n**Regarding flashing lights/reactions**\n\nYour description sounds like *photosensitivity*. It\u2019s good you are aware of this sensitivity.  It\u2019s worth exploring with a doctor\n\n**What Should You Do Now?**\n\n1.  **See a Doctor \u2013 A Neurologist is Key:**  *This is the most important step.*  Schedule an appointment with a neurologist.  Tell them about your birth history (as much as you know), your ADHD/ADD diagnosis, and your history of light sensitivity and any instances of seizure like activity.\n2.  **Medical Record Request:** If possible, obtain your birth records and newborn medical records.  Your parents may have some of these, or you can request them from the hospital where you were born. This will have crucial details about your Apgar scores, the extent of the resuscitation efforts, and any initial diagnoses or concerns.\n3.  **Possible Testing:** The neurologist may recommend some tests, which could include:\n    *   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To assess your brain's electrical activity and look for any seizure patterns.\n    *   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** To visualize your brain and look for any structural abnormalities that might be related to the asphyxia.\n    *   **Neuropsychological Testing:**  A comprehensive evaluation of your cognitive strengths and weaknesses. This can help clarify the nature of your ADHD and identify any other areas of cognitive impairment.\n4.  **Consider Genetic Testing:** While not directly related to the asphyxia itself, genetic testing can sometimes help rule out other underlying conditions.\n5.  **Be Thorough in Your History:** When you talk to doctors, be as detailed as possible. Include things that may seem minor \u2013 any developmental delays as a child, difficulties in school, etc.\n6.   **Vision Assessment**: Consider a comprehensive eye exam and discuss your light sensitivity with an ophthalmologist or optometrist.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Correlation vs. Causation:** Even if there's a clear link between your birth asphyxia and your current symptoms, it doesn't necessarily mean the asphyxia *caused* them. Other factors (genetics, environment) also play a role.\n*   **It's Not Your Fault:**  This is incredibly important. Whatever challenges you face, they are not your fault. Birth asphyxia is a medical event, and you deserve understanding and appropriate care.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  The information I provided is based on publicly available medical knowledge and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical consultation.  I strongly advise you to discuss your situation with a neurologist and other relevant specialists.\n\n\n\nI hope this comprehensive answer is helpful.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, that's a lot of symptoms packed into a 3-month span, and it's completely understandable why you're anxious, especially with the fear of a brain tumor lurking in the back of your mind.  Let's break this down, acknowledging your anxiety and trying to be thorough and realistic.  I will preface this by *strongly* reminding you that **I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice.**  This is information to help you discuss things *with* your doctor, not to replace a medical evaluation.\n\n**First: Addressing the Anxiety & Stress**\n\nYou've been through a *major* life stressor \u2013 a long-term breakup.  This is huge.  Severe anxiety and depression, as you already recognize, can manifest physically in a *staggering* number of ways.  You are right to consider this as a very prominent factor.  Here's how stress/anxiety can relate to *many* of your symptoms:\n\n*   **Phantom smells (phantosmia):** Stress and anxiety are well-known triggers for phantosmia.  The link likely involves the limbic system (emotional processing) having cross-talk with the olfactory (smell) processing areas of the brain.  The fact that the EEG was normal significantly lowers the risk of a neurological cause like epilepsy.\n*   **Muscle twitching:**  Extremely common with stress, anxiety, and even caffeine intake or dehydration.\n*   **Headaches:** Tension headaches are extremely common with stress.\n*   **Lightheadedness:** Anxiety can absolutely cause lightheadedness, often related to hyperventilation (even subtle) or changes in blood pressure. Low iron can also contribute, as you noted.\n*   **Cognitive issues (\"Tip of the tongue\" phenomenon, losing train of thought, daydreaming):**  Stress severely impacts cognitive function.  It interferes with concentration, memory, and information processing.  It's your brain trying to cope with overload.  The \"staring through things\" feeling is consistent with dissociation, a common anxiety response.\n*   **High-pitched ear noise (tinnitus):** While tinnitus has many causes, stress and anxiety can worsen it, or even trigger temporary episodes. \n\n**Second: Eye Symptoms**\n\nThese are the ones that understandably heighten your concerns. Let's look at each one:\n\n*   **Eye floaters (following eye movement in sunlight):**  This is very common, especially as you get older, and often perfectly normal.  Floaters are clumps in the vitreous humor (the gel-like substance filling your eye).  That they *follow* your eye movement is *expected* \u2013 they're inside your eye, moving *with* it.  The sunlight highlights them.  However, a sudden increase in floaters *should* be checked by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.\n*   **Bright flashing lights (outer right corner of eye):**  This is more concerning than floaters. This could be a migraine aura, even if you don't have a full-blown headache at the same time.  It could also be related to a retinal issue (though less likely if it's brief and infrequent).  **This absolutely requires an eye exam.** Don\u2019t delay this.  Tell the eye doctor about the duration, intensity, and frequency of the flashes.\n\n**Third: Other Symptoms & Considerations**\n\n*   **Tooth Decay:**  This is unrelated to the other symptoms, but important to address. An infection from the tooth *could* theoretically cause systemic symptoms (though usually fever, swelling, etc.), but it\u2019s unlikely to be the cause of your current issues. It's definitely worth getting fixed.\n*   **Low Iron:** This can contribute to fatigue, lightheadedness, and sometimes cognitive issues.  Have your iron levels checked and follow your doctor\u2019s recommendations for supplementation if needed.\n\n**Regarding Brain Tumors: Addressing Your Fear**\n\nIt's good you've had an EEG, and that it was normal. This reduces the likelihood of certain types of seizure-related activity.  However, it doesn't entirely rule out a brain tumor. The combination of symptoms *could* suggest a tumor, but most of these symptoms are FAR more commonly caused by anxiety, stress, and common, benign conditions.\n\n**Here's why your GP isn't overly concerned (and why their perspective is likely reasonable):**\n\n*   **The EEG was normal.** While not 100% definitive, it\u2019s a good first step.\n*   **The symptoms are diverse and fluctuating.** Brain tumor symptoms tend to be more progressive, localized, and consistent.  Your symptoms are varied and have come and gone.\n*   **The phantosmia has resolved.** Brain tumor-related smells wouldn't typically just disappear temporarily.\n*   **You have a clear, identifiable stressor.** This provides a strong alternative explanation for many of your symptoms.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do Now:**\n\n1.  **See an Ophthalmologist (Eye Doctor)**: *Immediately*.  Describe the flashing lights in detail.  They'll do a thorough examination to rule out retinal issues or migraine aura.  This is the most urgent step.\n2.  **Talk to Your GP Again:**  Specifically, discuss the flashing light issue and get their guidance on further investigation.  Be open about your anxiety about a brain tumor, but also acknowledge the stress you've been under. Ask about potential for referral to a neurologist for further peace of mind, but understand they may be hesitant if the eye exam is normal.\n3.  **Prioritize Mental Health:**  This is crucial. Continue with therapy, consider medication if appropriate (discuss with a psychiatrist), practice stress-reduction techniques (meditation, deep breathing, yoga, exercise), and focus on self-care.\n4. **Follow up on Iron levels:** Make sure they are in a good range\n5. **Dental Checkup:** Get your tooth addressed.\n\n**Important Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**\n\n*   \"Given the flashing lights in my vision, what specific tests would you recommend to rule out any serious eye problems?\"\n*   \"What other symptoms would be concerning enough to warrant a brain scan (like an MRI)?\"\n*   \"What are the chances that all of this is related to anxiety and stress?\"\n*   \"What resources are available for managing my anxiety and depression?\"\n\n\n\n**Finally:**  I know it's hard, but try to avoid excessive self-diagnosis (Googling symptoms is often unhelpful!).  You're proactively seeking information, which is good, but rely on medical professionals to make a diagnosis.  It's far more likely that your symptoms are a result of stress, anxiety, and common, treatable conditions than a rare and serious illness.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.  Please remember to consult with qualified healthcare professionals for personalized advice and treatment.\n\n\n\n"

        "question": "Hello all, I had a question about my medication and fasting, if that's alright. I take Keppra twice a day (500mg each), once in the morning and once at night. With Ramadan approaching I was wondering how much time there needs to be in between taking one pill at night and one in the morning, thanks.Let me know if I need to add anything else.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a very important question and I'm glad you're thinking about it *before* Ramadan begins.  Mixing medications and fasting requires careful consideration, and you are right to ask.  Here's a breakdown of information, along with why I *strongly* advise you to discuss this with your doctor and a qualified Islamic scholar knowledgeable about medical conditions.  I will give a detailed response, but **please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**Understanding Keppra (Levetiracetam) and Fasting**\n\n* **Keppra's Mechanism:** Keppra (Levetiracetam) is an anti-epileptic drug (AED).  It works to prevent seizures by affecting chemical messengers in the brain.  Maintaining consistent blood levels of Keppra is crucial for its effectiveness.  Fluctuations in those levels can *potentially* increase seizure risk.\n* **Why Timing Matters:** The timing of your Keppra doses is directly related to keeping those blood levels stable. The longer the interval between doses, the more the level in your blood could drop, especially with a medication like Keppra that doesn't have a super long half-life.\n* **Ramadan Considerations:**  Ramadan involves fasting from dawn until sunset.  This means a potentially very long period (often 10-16 hours, depending on location and time of year) without food, drink, *and* medications.\n\n\n\n**Your Specific Situation (500mg twice a day)**\n\nYou take Keppra 500mg twice a day, with roughly 12 hours between doses. This is a pretty standard dosing schedule.  Here\u2019s what to consider with Ramadan:\n\n* **Typical Interval:** Your current schedule seems to be approximately 12 hours between doses, based on your mention of morning and night.\n* **Ramadan's Impact:** Depending on your sunrise and sunset times, the fasting period could significantly *exceed* the 12-hour gap you're currently used to. This is the core of the concern.  If that gap gets too long, it could affect how well Keppra controls your seizures.\n* **Minimum Interval - Generally:**  While I cannot give medical advice, generally, for Keppra, a healthcare professional prefers you not exceed 12 hours between doses. *However*, this is a very individual thing.  Your doctor will consider your seizure history, individual metabolism, and other factors to determine what's safe *for you*.\n\n**What You Need to Discuss with Your Doctor (Essential!)**\n\nThis is *not* something you should decide on your own. You *must* consult your doctor.  Here are specific questions to ask them:\n\n1. **Is it safe for me to fast while taking Keppra?**  This is the primary question. They may advise against fasting, particularly if your seizures are not fully controlled.\n2. **Can my Keppra dosage or schedule be adjusted for Ramadan?** They might suggest:\n   * **Splitting the dose:**  Could you take 250mg twice *during* your non-fasting hours?  This could help maintain more consistent levels.\n   * **Changing the timing:**  Could you shift your doses closer together within your eating window?\n   * **Adding a third dose:** (Less likely, but a possibility) A small third dose during the non-fasting period.\n3. **What are the signs that my Keppra levels might be dropping, and what should I do if I experience them?** You need to know what symptoms to watch for (e.g., increased anxiety, difficulty concentrating, unusual tiredness, or, of course, any pre-seizure aura or seizure activity).  Get a clear action plan.\n4. **Are there any specific interactions between Keppra and dehydration (which can be a risk during fasting)?**\n5. **How will fasting affect the monitoring of my Keppra levels (if you have blood tests to check them)?**\n\n\n\n**Consultation with an Islamic Scholar (Equally Important!)**\n\nEven if your doctor says it\u2019s medically safe to *attempt* fasting with adjustments, you need to discuss this with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar.  Here's why:\n\n* **Religious Exemptions:**  Islam provides exemptions from fasting for those who are ill or whose health would be negatively impacted.  Managing a chronic medical condition like epilepsy *falls under this*.  \n* **Making Up Missed Fasts:**  The scholar can advise you on how to properly make up any missed fasts according to Islamic guidelines (e.g., *fidyah* \u2013 providing food to those in need).\n* **Peace of Mind:**  Getting religious guidance will give you peace of mind knowing you're adhering to your faith in a way that also prioritizes your health.  Find a scholar who understands medical issues and can provide informed advice.\n\n**Important Considerations During Ramadan if You Do Fast (with Medical Approval)**\n\n* **Hydration:** If you're allowed to fast, prioritize *intense* hydration during your non-fasting hours.  Dehydration can potentially lower your seizure threshold.\n* **Diet:**  Eat nutritious, balanced meals during *suhoor* (pre-dawn meal) and *iftar* (sunset meal).\n* **Sleep:** Get adequate sleep.  Sleep deprivation can also increase seizure risk.\n* **Stress Management:** Ramadan can be a busy and sometimes stressful time.  Manage your stress levels as much as possible.\n* **Inform Family/Friends:** Let your family and friends know you are taking Keppra and are fasting, so they can be aware of potential seizure symptoms and help if needed.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "Recently I got a hickie, and tons of people started telling me to be careful because I could die, and stuff. Is it that dangerous? Male 17, epilepsy, anxiety, question: are hickies dangerous?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, let's address this. It's *really* good you're asking, especially given your medical history of epilepsy and anxiety. The stories you're hearing about hickeys being *deadly* are **extremely rare and largely based on misinformation that spread online a few years ago.** However, given your epilepsy, it's wise to be cautious and understand the potential (though still low) risks.  Here's a breakdown, tailored to your situation, and with a strong emphasis on getting you accurate information:\n\n**What *is* a Hickey?**\n\nA hickey (also called a love bite) is essentially a bruise. It happens when someone sucks on your skin and breaks small blood vessels under the surface.  The discoloration is from blood leaking into the surrounding tissue.\n\n**Why the Rumors About Danger? (And why they're mostly false)**\n\nThe scare originated from a few isolated cases reported in the media where people (mostly young and healthy) experienced stroke-like symptoms *after* receiving a hickey, particularly on the neck. The theory was that the suction could, in very rare instances, disrupt the vertebral artery (an artery in the neck) leading to a blood clot that travels to the brain.  \n\n* **The evidence is extremely limited:** These cases are incredibly rare.  Millions of people get hickeys without incident. Most medical professionals consider the risk of stroke from a hickey to be exceedingly low.\n* **Underlying Conditions:**  In the reported cases, *many* of the individuals may have already had underlying, undiagnosed vascular issues (problems with their blood vessels) that predisposed them to the issue, and the hickey just happened to coincide with a developing problem.\n* **Misdiagnosis:** Some events initially attributed to hickeys were later found to be caused by other things.\n\n\n\n**How Your Epilepsy Changes Things (Important!)**\n\nThis is where it gets more important to be careful. Because you have epilepsy:\n\n* **Potential for Triggering Seizures (Low, but possible):**  Any significant change in blood flow or blood pressure *could* theoretically lower your seizure threshold, meaning it could make a seizure *slightly* more likely. This isn\u2019t a certainty, and it\u2019s not a high risk, but it's something to be aware of. The suddenness of bruising and inflammation could potentially be a factor.\n* **Medication Considerations:** If you're on medication for your epilepsy, any change in your body's usual state (even something like bruising) *could* have an unpredictable interaction. (This is also a low risk, but worth thinking about).\n\n**How Your Anxiety Changes Things (Also Important!)**\n\nYou also mentioned having anxiety. \n\n* **Health Anxiety:**  Hearing scary stories about hickeys and then feeling worried can significantly worsen anxiety.  The anxiety itself can sometimes trigger physical symptoms that might be misconstrued as something serious.\n* **Focusing on Bodily Sensations:**  Anxiety can make you hyper-aware of normal bodily sensations, potentially leading you to misinterpret them.  \n\n\n\n**What should *you* do?**\n\n1. **Avoid hickeys on the neck.** This is the most important thing.  Given your epilepsy, it's best to steer clear of having hickeys placed on your neck, especially directly on the sides where the vertebral arteries are located.  Other areas of the body are much safer.\n2. **If you *do* get a hickey, even on another part of your body...**\n   * **Monitor for any unusual symptoms:** This is key.  Be alert for things like:\n      * **Severe headache**\n      * **Dizziness or vertigo (feeling like the room is spinning)**\n      * **Vision changes (double vision, blurred vision)**\n      * **Difficulty speaking**\n      * **Weakness or numbness on one side of your body**\n      * **Seizures \u2013 *any* change in your usual seizure pattern**\n   * **If you experience *any* of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.** Go to the emergency room or have someone drive you.  Don't wait.  Tell the medical staff about the hickey *and* your epilepsy.\n3. **Talk to your Neurologist:** The *best* thing to do is discuss this with your neurologist. They know your specific epilepsy condition and can provide personalized advice on the level of risk you face and what to watch out for. Schedule an appointment and ask them directly.  Bring up the information you've been hearing.\n4. **Manage Your Anxiety:**  The fear is likely the biggest immediate problem. Practice your usual anxiety management techniques (deep breathing, mindfulness, talking to a therapist, etc.).  Remind yourself that the risk of serious complications is very low, but that you're being proactive about your health.\n5. **Reliable Sources of Information:** Don't rely on random internet stories. Here are some reliable sources:\n    * **Mayo Clinic:** [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hickeys/symptoms-causes/syc-20378976](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hickeys/symptoms-causes/syc-20378976)\n    * **Cleveland Clinic:** [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23544-hickeys](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23544-hickeys)\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  *Especially* because you have epilepsy, getting advice tailored to *your* situation from your neurologist is crucial.\n\n\n\n**To summarize:**  The direct risk of death from a hickey is extremely low. However, *because* of your epilepsy, it's wise to be extra cautious and avoid them on your neck. Monitor for any unusual symptoms, and, most importantly, talk to your neurologist.  Don't let anxiety take over, but *do* be proactive about your health.\n\n\n\nDo you want to talk more about managing your anxiety related to this? Or would you like help phrasing questions to ask your neurologist?"

        "question": "30 AFAB, 158cm/61kg, hispanic, Symptoms: lightheadedness, fatigue, darker urine, light periods. flu-ish [see below] since a month ago.Diagnoses: Epilepsy, ADHD, Endometriosis, 5cm ovarian cyst, migrainesMedications: Lamotrigine 225mg, Ibuprofen for endometriosis pain, very occasional Concerta, haven't used it for a few months, melatonin over the summer (stopped it about two months ago)Others: Drink 1-2 drinks monthly, Slowly stopping smoking down from 6 to 1-2 per day and 1 light snus, last two days have started taking Vitamin D and I have been using a therapy lamp for 20 min every morning for the last two weeks. Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a lot to unpack, and you're right to be cautious about running to the doctor for *everything* given your history. But you're also smart to loop all of this together and ask for guidance. Let's break down your concerns and try to prioritize what warrants a doctor's visit soon, and what you can monitor.  Because you're in Norway, I'll also mention resources specific to that system at the end.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This information is for consideration and discussion with your actual doctor.\n\n\n\n**1. Prioritized Concerns - See a Doctor Relatively Soon (Within 2 Weeks)**\n\n*   **Dark Urine + Fatigue + Light Periods:** This combination is the most concerning.  It isn't just \"dehydration\" if you're drinking plenty of water. This absolutely needs investigation. Possible causes (which *your doctor* needs to rule in or out):\n    *   **Liver issues:**  Dark urine can be a sign of bilirubin in the urine, which suggests liver dysfunction. Fatigue is a common symptom of liver problems. Your family history of cancer makes this more important to investigate.\n    *   **Kidney Issues:** Although less likely with good hydration, kidney problems can also cause dark urine and fatigue.\n    *   **Dehydration is a possibility,** but given water intake, it needs a deeper look.\n    *   **Hemolysis (Breakdown of red blood cells):** Though less common, this can cause dark urine and fatigue.\n*   **Ovarian Cyst & Increasing Pain:**  While a 5cm cyst that\u2019s been there 10 years isn't *automatically* an emergency, *increasing* pain, tenderness, cramping, and pain with exercise is a red flag. You especially need to rule out:\n    *   **Ovarian Torsion:**  This is a twisting of the ovary on its supporting ligaments, cutting off blood supply.  This is *an emergency*. Pain with movement increases suspicion for this.\n    *   **Cyst Rupture:** Can cause significant pain.\n    *   **Growth or Change in Cyst Characteristics:**  10 years is long enough that a change in size or character warrants investigation.  While it might still be benign, it needs to be reassessed, especially with your family history.  There is a small chance it could be cancerous, and early detection is crucial.\n    *   **Endometrioma:** Cysts filled with endometrial tissue can cause pain and grow.\n\n**2.  Monitor Closely & Discuss with Doctor at Next Routine Appointment (Within 1-3 Months, or if things worsen)**\n\n*   **Flu-ish Symptoms/Increased Susceptibility to Illness:** Repeated \"colds\" without full recovery *could* be:\n    *   **Compromised Immune System:** Fatigue, stress, and potentially even medication side effects (Lamotrigine *can* sometimes affect the immune system) could play a role.\n    *   **Chronic Viral Infection:** (Less likely, but worth considering if symptoms persist).\n    * **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):** Could be worsening your baseline depression. The therapy lamp is helpful, but if it's not enough, discuss it with your doctor.\n*   **Demotivation/Low Mood:** As you suspect, this *could* be depression, exacerbated by seasonal changes and adjusting to a new country.  *However*, it's important to rule out physical causes contributing to the fatigue *before* solely attributing it to mood.  If it persists despite the lamp and vitamin D, explore options with your doctor/therapist.\n* **Increased Hunger/Nausea:** Possibly related to the cyst or hormonal changes. Monitor for weight loss or gain and worsening nausea.\n\n**3.  Less Urgent, but Keep Noted**\n\n*   **Light Periods:** You are doing the right things by taking pregnancy tests. As long as periods don't stop altogether, and are otherwise normal, this may just be hormonal changes related to endometriosis, age, or stress.   However, if completely stopping, this is another thing to discuss.\n* **Smoking:** Good job on cutting back!\n\n\n\n**Regarding Your Family History of Cancer & Your Anxiety:**\n\nIt\u2019s very understandable that a family history of cancer makes you hyper-aware. This is good!  However, anxiety can also make you *overinterpret* physical sensations.  It's important to:\n\n*   **Be Specific with Your Doctor:**  Tell them about your family history and your anxiety.  This helps them tailor their investigations appropriately.\n*   **Ask For Clear Explanations:**  Don\u2019t be afraid to ask \u201cWhat are we ruling out with this test?\u201d\n*   **Focus on What You Can Control:**  Healthy lifestyle (diet, hydration, exercise *within your limits*), reducing smoking, and managing stress.\n\n\n\n\n**What to tell your doctor:**\n\n* **A concise summary** of your symptoms, focusing on what has changed recently. Mention the order of their appearance.\n* **Your concerns**\u2013be upfront about your family history and anxiety around serious illness.\n* **Your medication list** (including everything, even occasional use meds).\n* **Your new habits** (vitamin D, therapy lamp, smoking reduction).\n* **Your exercise limitations**.\n\n\n\n\n**Resources in Norway:**\n\n*   **Legevakt (Emergency Doctor):** 116117 \u2013 For urgent but non-life-threatening situations.\n*   **Fastlege (General Practitioner):**  Your primary care physician.  This is your first point of contact.  Finding a good fastlege is important.\n*   **Helsenorge.no:** The official website for health information in Norway:  [https://www.helsenorge.no/en/](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/)\n* **Sykehuset (Hospital):** If your fastlege deems it necessary, they will refer you to a specialist at a hospital.\n\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYour intuition is valuable. The combination of symptoms you\u2019re experiencing, *especially* the dark urine, fatigue, and light periods alongside the worsening ovarian pain, is enough to warrant a prompt medical evaluation. Don't dismiss it as \"just hormones\" or depression without a thorough medical workup. It's better to be safe and get peace of mind, especially given your anxieties and family history.\n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any other questions."

Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is a *really* interesting and well-described pattern, and it's smart of you to start thinking about what's going on here. It's great you've noticed this consistently across multiple surgeries. Here's a breakdown of potential explanations, connecting your medical history and medications, and what you might discuss with your doctors.  I'll cover several aspects, ranging from more likely to less common.  **Important Disclaimer at the end!**\n\n**Understanding the Phenomenon: Delayed Pain & Post-Surgery Hyperactivity**\n\nThe combination of feeling unusually energetic, a delayed perception of pain, and an increased appetite after general anesthesia is not typical.  Here\u2019s what might be happening, broken down into components:\n\n\n\n**1. Impact of Your Underlying Conditions & Medications:**\n\n*   **ADHD & Tourette's Synergy:**  ADHD and Tourette's, especially when co-occurring (which is common), can affect dopamine and norepinephrine regulation in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are key players in alertness, motivation, and pain modulation.  Your brain *already* operates with a unique neurochemical balance.\n*   **Lamotrigine & Sertraline Interaction:** Both of these medications can subtly affect neurotransmitter levels.\n    *   **Lamotrigine:** Modulates glutamate activity and can have some indirect effects on dopamine. It's primarily a mood stabilizer, but can subtly boost cognitive function in some people with ADHD.\n    *   **Sertraline:**  An SSRI, primarily affects serotonin, but can indirectly impact dopamine and norepinephrine. \n    *   **Combined Effect:** The interplay between these drugs could be leading to a rounding up of dopamine/norepinephrine levels, so when anesthesia briefly suppresses everything, the rebound isn\u2019t a crash, but a relative *increase* in these stimulant neurotransmitters.\n*   **Epilepsy & Anesthesia:**  While well-controlled epilepsy usually isn\u2019t a huge issue with anesthesia, the brain's excitation/inhibition balance is fundamentally altered in epilepsy.  Anesthesia can sometimes \"reset\" things in a way that temporarily exaggerates the excitatory side, particularly if there's underlying subtle seizure activity even with medication. (This isn't suggesting you're having seizures, just that the brain's threshold for excitation might be lower).\n\n\n\n**2. Anesthesia & Your Brain:**\n\n*   **Anesthesia's Rebound Effect:** General anesthesia works by briefly disrupting brain activity. When the drugs wear off, there's a rebound effect.  In *most* people, this is experienced as grogginess and pain. However, in your case, it appears your brain is reacting differently.\n*   **Opioid Resistance (Codeine):**  Your lack of response to codeine suggests you may have naturally higher levels of endorphins or some genetic variation in opioid receptors. This also points to a potentially different pain processing pathway.\n*  **Higher Anaesthetic Requirements:** Needing extra anaesthetic at the dentist ties into resistance - you may metabolise it quicker than most. \n*   **Neuroplasticity & Brain \"Resilience\":**  Living with ADHD and Tourette's may have created a level of neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to rewire itself). Your brain might be more adaptable and better at compensating for the temporary disruption caused by anesthesia.  It could be bouncing *back* more effectively.\n*   **GABA levels:** Anaesthetic can inhibit GABA levels, but it\u2019s possible your brain recovers this quicker, contributing to the hyperactivity.\n\n**3. Pain Perception Differences:**\n\n*   **Endorphin Release:** The stress of surgery *does* trigger endorphin release. However, in someone with potential opioid resistance, those endorphins might be having a *stimulating* effect rather than a purely pain-relieving one.\n*   **Dopamine and Pain Modulation:** Dopamine can actually *increase* pain tolerance in some circumstances.  The surge of dopamine post-anesthesia could be masking the pain signals.\n* **Dissociation**: Some people experience a dissociative effect during and after anaesthesia, which can alter pain perception.\n\n\n\n\n**Why it's happening *to you* \u2013 a working hypothesis:**\n\nMy strongest suspicion is a complex interaction between your existing neurochemical profile (ADHD & Tourette's, medications), a potentially resilient brain's response to anesthesia, and a different way your body processes endorphins. The anesthesia briefly suppresses everything, then the rebound isn't a typical \"crash\" but a surge in dopamine and norepinephrine, masking pain and boosting energy.\n\n\n\n**What to Discuss with Your Doctors:**\n\n1.  **Anesthesiologist:** *This is the most important conversation.* Explain your consistent experience in detail.  Ask them:\n    *   \"Could my ADHD, Tourette's, and/or medications be contributing to this unusual reaction to anesthesia?\"\n    *   \"Are there alternative anesthetic agents or techniques that might be more suitable for me, considering my history?\" (e.g., a faster-acting, shorter-duration anesthetic might minimize the rebound).\n    *   \"Could my opioid resistance be a factor in how I perceive pain?\"\n    *   \"Should my medications be adjusted *before* surgery (with the guidance of your psychiatrist)?\" (Don't change medications on your own!)\n    *   \"Should I have more proactive pain management strategies *planned specifically for the delayed onset*?\"\n2.  **Psychiatrist:** Discuss the potential impact of your medications (Lamotrigine and Sertraline) on your anesthetic response.\n3. **Neurologist**: Discuss whether any of your neurological conditions (Epilepsy, Tourette\u2019s, ADHD) could be affecting the way your brain responds to anaesthesia.\n\n**Important Considerations & What To Expect:**\n\n*   **It's Not Harmful (Probably):** This phenomenon doesn\u2019t sound dangerous *per se*, but it can be unsettling and potentially make it harder for medical staff to assess your post-operative recovery.\n*   **Documentation is Key:**  Make sure your anesthesiologist has a clear record of this happening with previous surgeries.\n*   **Be Proactive:**  Don\u2019t be afraid to advocate for yourself and ask questions!\n*   **Pain Management Plan:** Discuss a plan for managing pain *after* the initial period of hyperactivity.  This might involve non-opioid pain relievers, nerve blocks, or other strategies.\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this sounds really uncomfortable and understandably anxiety-provoking, especially with the recurring nature of the pain and the added stress of being late on your period. Let's break down the possibilities, considering your medications and history, and then talk about what you should do next.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is NOT medical advice.**\n\n**Possible Causes - Considering Your Situation**\n\nIt's important to investigate, but here are several things that *could* be contributing to your symptoms. We'll categorize them:\n\n**1. Medication Related:**\n\n* **Keppra (Levetiracetam):** While generally well-tolerated, Keppra *can* sometimes cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and even diarrhea or abdominal pain. It's less common with long-term use (you've been on it 2 years), but it\u2019s still a possibility.  Sometimes, side effects can reappear or change even after being stable for a while.\n* **Amitriptyline Withdrawal:**  While you say the withdrawal symptoms are easing, gut motility (how quickly things move through your digestive system) can be affected by stopping antidepressants.  The lingering effects of withdrawal, even mild ones, could contribute to the discomfort.  The gut and brain are very connected.\n* **Drug Interactions:**  While typically not a major concern with this combination, it's *always* worth checking for potential interactions.  A pharmacist or doctor can properly assess this.\n\n**2. Gastrointestinal Issues:**\n\n* **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** This is a common possibility, especially given the recurring pain, bloating, gurgling, and urgency to go to the bathroom even when nothing is there.  Stress and anxiety are *huge* triggers for IBS.  The feeling of needing to go is a hallmark symptom.\n* **Functional Dyspepsia:**  This causes pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen. It's similar to IBS but focuses more on the upper digestive tract.\n* **Food Intolerances/Sensitivities:** You\u2019ve already started self-managing by cutting out sodas and spicy foods, which is good.  It\u2019s possible you are reacting to something else.  Common culprits include dairy, gluten, or certain types of carbohydrates (FODMAPs).\n* **Gastritis/Peptic Ulcer:** While less likely with your description unless you're regularly taking NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), inflammation of the stomach lining or ulcers could cause pain and a feeling of fullness/urgency.\n* **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):**  An overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can cause bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits.\n* **Constipation:** Even with the feeling of needing to go, you could be experiencing disguised constipation. It sometimes manifests as frequent, incomplete urges.\n\n**3. Gynecological Factors:**\n\n* **Pregnancy:** A 23-day late period, even with irregularity, *requires* a pregnancy test. This is the first thing to rule out.\n* **Hormonal Imbalance:** Irregular periods can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance (like PCOS). These imbalances can sometimes affect the digestive system as well.\n* **Other Gynecological Issues:** less likely, but should be kept in mind.\n\n**4. Anxiety & The Gut-Brain Connection:**\n\n* **Visceral Hypersensitivity:** Anxiety can amplify your perception of gut sensations, making normal digestive processes feel painful or uncomfortable.\n* **Anxiety-Induced Digestive Changes:**  Anxiety can directly cause changes in gut motility, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or urgency.  This creates a vicious cycle.\n\n\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n1. **Pregnancy Test:**  Take a home pregnancy test *immediately*.  Even with irregular periods, it needs to be ruled out.  If it's positive, you'll need to see a doctor right away.\n\n2. **See a Doctor (Primary Care Physician or Gastroenterologist):**  This is the most important step.  Describe your symptoms *in detail*, including:\n   * The timing and character of the pain (sharp, dull, cramping, etc.)\n   * What makes it better or worse (eating, position, stress, etc.)\n   * The frequency and consistency of your bowel movements\n   * The urgency and gurgling\n   * Your medication list (including dosages) and the recent amitriptyline withdrawal.\n   * Your period history.\n   * Your anxiety attacks.\n\n3. **Possible Tests Your Doctor Might Order:**\n   * **Blood Tests:** To rule out inflammation, infection, thyroid problems, and check basic liver and kidney function.\n   * **Stool Tests:** To check for infection, inflammation, and blood.\n   * **Urine Test:** To rule out urinary tract infections, which can sometimes mimic abdominal pain.\n   * **Pregnancy Test (if not already done):** Confirmed in a clinical setting.\n   * **Possibly:**  Depending on your symptoms and initial tests, your doctor might consider:\n      * **Endoscopy/Colonoscopy:** To visualize the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.\n      * **Hydrogen Breath Test:** To check for SIBO.\n      * **Food Allergy/Intolerance Testing:**  (Often debated in effectiveness, but might be considered).\n      * **Hormonal Blood Tests:** If irregular periods are a concern.\n\n4. **Food Diary:** Start keeping a detailed food diary, noting *everything* you eat and drink, and how you feel afterward (pain levels, urgency, gurgling, anxiety). This can help identify potential trigger foods.\n\n5. **Stress Management:**  Continue working on managing your anxiety.  Techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or therapy can be very helpful.\n\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Don't self-treat for too long.** While dietary changes are a good start, prolonged self-treatment can mask underlying issues.\n* **Be honest with your doctor about everything,** including your anxiety and the amitriptyline withdrawal.  It's all relevant information.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask questions.**  You deserve to understand what's going on with your body.\n\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional.

        "question": "Gender: Female, Age: 9, Height: Idk tbh, Location: Head, How long ago: 1 week.So my co-workers daughter was just diagnosed with grey matter heterotopia. She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren\u2019t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Okay, this is incredibly kind of you to do for your coworker. It's awful to watch a parent go through this, and wanting to offer support and information is a really thoughtful gesture. Here's a breakdown of information about Grey Matter Heterotopia (GMH), potential options, and how to approach this sensitive situation.  I'll try to be thorough, but *please read the disclaimer at the end* as I am not a medical professional.  This is for informational purposes only and shouldn't replace a doctor's advice.\n\n**Understanding Grey Matter Heterotopia (GMH)**\n\n* **What it is:** GMH is a rare neurological disorder that occurs during brain development.  Essentially, groups of neurons (the grey matter, responsible for processing information) don't migrate to their correct location in the brain during fetal development. Instead, they stay near the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces) typically forming nodules or layers.  Think of it like construction workers building a city, and some of the buildings end up in the wrong place.\n* **Why it causes problems:** Because the neurons are misplaced, they can interfere with normal brain function. The severity varies *greatly* depending on how much grey matter is misplaced, exactly where it is located, and whether it disrupts critical pathways.\n* **Symptoms:** Symptoms are incredibly diverse.  They can include:\n    * **Seizures:** A very common symptom. These can range from mild to severe, and the type of seizure varies.\n    * **Developmental Delays:** This can affect motor skills (walking, coordination), speech, cognitive abilities (learning, problem-solving), and social skills.  The degree of delay is highly variable.\n    * **Cognitive Impairment:**  Again, the range is huge \u2013 some individuals have normal intelligence, while others may have mild to moderate intellectual disability.\n    * **Weakness on One Side of the Body:** Depending on the location of the misplaced grey matter.\n    * **Vision Problems:**  Can occur if the GMH affects areas involved in vision processing.\n    * **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):** There's a higher association between GMH and ASD.\n    * **Other Neurological Issues:**  Difficulties with movement, balance, or coordination.\n* **Types of GMH:**  There are different classifications based on the pattern of misplaced grey matter (nodular, laminar, band-like, etc.).  The specific type can sometimes give clues about potential prognosis.\n\n\n\n**What Options Might Be Discussed (and what your coworker should ask the doctor)**\n\nThe October appointment will be crucial. Here's what your coworker's doctor will likely discuss, and what questions they should be prepared to ask:\n\n1. **Diagnosis Confirmation & Specific Type:**  The doctor will confirm the diagnosis with imaging (MRI is the key).  They'll also determine *which type* of GMH the daughter has.\n\n2. **Seizure Management:** This is the immediate priority.\n   * **Anti-Seizure Medications (ASMs):**  The doctor will likely start or adjust medications to control seizures. Finding the right medication and dosage can take time and adjustment.  It's crucial to discuss potential side effects.\n   * **Ketogenic Diet:** In some cases, a ketogenic diet (very high fat, very low carb) can help reduce seizures.  It's a challenging diet to maintain, requiring strict adherence.\n   * **Consider Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** This involves implanting a device that sends electrical impulses to the vagus nerve, which can help control seizures.  It's usually considered if medications aren't fully effective.\n\n3. **Developmental Support:** This is ongoing and vital.\n   * **Early Intervention Services:**  *Crucially important!*  These services (usually available through the state/county) provide therapies for infants and toddlers with developmental delays, including:\n      * **Physical Therapy (PT):**  To improve motor skills.\n      * **Occupational Therapy (OT):**  To help with daily living skills.\n      * **Speech Therapy:**  To address speech and language delays.\n   * **Special Education:** As the child gets older, an Individualized Education Program (IEP) will be developed to address her specific needs in school.\n   * **Developmental Pediatrician:** A specialist in child development can provide ongoing assessment and guidance.\n\n4. **Genetic Testing:**  GMH can sometimes be linked to genetic mutations, though often it occurs sporadically (meaning it's not inherited).  Genetic testing can help understand the cause and potentially inform prognosis.\n\n5. **Surgery (Rarest Option):**  In *very rare* and specific cases, surgery to remove some of the misplaced grey matter *might* be considered. This is only done in specific situations where the GMH is causing significant obstruction or can be safely removed without causing more harm. It's not a common treatment.\n\n**Important Questions Your Coworker Should Ask the Doctor:**\n\n* \"What type of GMH does my daughter have?\"\n* \"What is the expected prognosis for *this specific type* of GMH?\" (Prognosis varies greatly)\n* \"What are the potential long-term effects?\"\n* \"What are the best seizure control options for her, and what are the potential side effects?\"\n* \"What developmental therapies should we start with, and how often?\"\n* \"What genetic testing is recommended?\"\n* \"Are there any clinical trials or research studies available?\"\n* \u201cWhat resources are available to help us navigate this?\u201d (Support groups, advocacy organizations, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n**How to Support Your Coworker (What you can say/do):**\n\n* **Acknowledge her feelings:** \"I was so sorry to hear about [daughter's name]'s diagnosis. It must be incredibly overwhelming.\"  Don't try to minimize her pain.\n* **Listen:**  Let her talk without interrupting (unless she asks for advice).\n* **Offer practical help:** \"Is there anything I can do to help?  Can I bring you a meal, run an errand, or just watch [daughter's name] for an hour so you can rest?\"\n* **Share information (gently):**  You can say something like, \"I did a little reading about GMH (I'm leaving a link to a helpful site below), and it seems like there's a range of outcomes, and early intervention can make a big difference.  I'm not a doctor, but I wanted to share what I found.\"  **Don't overwhelm her with information!**  Keep it simple.\n* **Be a consistent source of support.**  Check in with her regularly, even if it's just a quick message.\n* **Avoid offering unsolicited advice.** Unless she specifically asks for your opinion, just listen and offer empathy.\n* **Celebrate the small wins:**  Acknowledge and celebrate any progress her daughter makes, no matter how small.\n\n\n\n**Helpful Resources to Share (or for your own understanding):**\n\n* **Hope for HM:** [https://hopeforhm.org/](https://hopeforhm.org/)  (Excellent resource, patient-focused)\n* **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD):** [https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/grey-matter-heterotopia/](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/grey-matter-heterotopia/)\n* **Children's Brain Foundation:** [https://www.childrensbrainfoundation.org/](https://www.childrensbrainfoundation.org/)\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\nI am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice. The information provided here is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

        "question": "25F, 200lb, 5\u20194, asthma, current medications wellbutrin SR, vyvanse, lexapro, montelukast, spironolactone. i do not drink any alcohol, use cannabis 5-7x a weekOccasionally, I will have an intense sensation of deja vu, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as disoriented. It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a really interesting and well-described experience! You've provided a lot of helpful details, and it's good you're taking the time to think about what's going on. Here's a breakdown of potential explanations, things to consider regarding your medications, and advice on what to do next, aiming to be thorough and informative.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end.**\n\n**Understanding What You're Experiencing**\n\nWhat you're describing is *not* typical deja vu. While the initial feeling of \"I've been here before\" is classic deja vu, the intense disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and prolonged \"weirdness\" afterwards goes beyond the typical experience. This progression suggests something more complex is happening.  Here's a breakdown of possible contributors:\n\n* **Deja Vu & Temporal Lobe Activity:** Deja vu itself is thought to originate in the temporal lobe of the brain, the area responsible for memory and sensory processing.  A momentary \"misfire\" in this region can trigger the feeling of familiarity. However, in *some* people, especially those prone to more pronounced experiences, this can be accompanied by other neurological sensations.\n* **Complex Partial Seizure (CPS) \u2013 A Consideration:** This is where it gets important to be cautious.  What you\u2019re describing *can* sometimes resemble a simple partial seizure (also called a focal aware seizure) originating in the temporal lobe. Auras (the sensations *before* a seizure) can manifest as deja vu, dizziness, nausea, a sense of unreality, and confusion.  The fact that this used to happen more as a child, and has returned, is a detail to note. *However*,  many things can cause these sensations, and it *does not* automatically mean you're having seizures.\n* **Dissociation:**  This is a mental process where you feel disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, surroundings, or even your identity.  It can manifest in many ways, including feelings of unreality, derealization (feeling the world isn't real), and depersonalization (feeling detached from yourself).  Your description of \"weirdness\" and difficulty socializing afterwards fits this. Stress, anxiety (which your medications suggest you may experience), and even vivid dreams can trigger dissociation.\n* **Vivid Dreaming and Boundary Blurring:** You're spot-on to connect this to your vivid dreams.  When dreams are very realistic, or when you're particularly aware of dreaming as it happens (lucid dreaming), it can sometimes blur the lines between dream and reality upon waking, or even during waking hours.  Your ability to recognize the 'setup' for a dream is pretty fascinating, and could suggest a naturally active dream state.\n* **Cannabis Use:**  While not the primary cause, regular cannabis use can *absolutely* contribute to these kinds of experiences.  THC can affect temporal lobe activity, and disrupt the normal processing of sensory information, potentially exacerbating any underlying predisposition to deja vu or dissociation. The frequency of use (5-7x/week) warrants consideration.\n\n\n\n\n**Medication Interactions & Contributions**\n\nYour medication list is important to consider:\n\n* **Wellbutrin (Bupropion):**  Generally, Wellbutrin is not directly linked to deja vu or these kinds of sensations. But it *can* sometimes exacerbate anxiety in certain individuals.\n* **Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine):** Stimulants (like Vyvanse) can, in rare cases, increase the risk of seizures, especially in individuals with a pre-existing, undiagnosed seizure disorder.  They can also contribute to anxiety and feelings of agitation.\n* **Lexapro (Escitalopram):**  An SSRI.  Less directly linked to these kinds of sensations than Vyvanse, but can sometimes cause changes in sensory perception as a side effect.\n* **Montelukast (Singulair):** Primarily for asthma but has been linked to *rare* psychiatric side effects, including changes in mood, behavior, and even seizures. This is less common, but worth knowing.\n* **Spironolactone:** Mainly a diuretic and androgen blocker.  Unlikely to be directly contributing to these sensations.\n\n**The interplay of these meds could be creating a situation where you're more susceptible to these experiences.** It\u2019s not a simple case of 'this medication is causing it,' but the cumulative effect needs to be considered. Your doctor needs to be aware of everything you\u2019re experiencing, in the context of your medication regimen.\n\n**What You Should Do Next:**\n\n1. **See Your Doctor (Primary Care Physician or Psychiatrist):**  *This is the most important step.*  You *need* to discuss these experiences with the doctor who prescribes your medications.  Specifically:\n   * **Detailed Description:**  Bring this detailed description of your experiences \u2013 how they start, what they feel like, how long they last, and what makes them better or worse.\n   * **Medication Review:** Ask your doctor to review your medication list, considering potential interactions and whether any adjustments might be beneficial.\n   * **Rule Out Medical Concerns:** Advocate for discussion of the possibility of simple partial seizures.  They may recommend further investigation (see below).\n   * **Cannabis Use:** Be honest about your cannabis use. Your doctor needs to know this to accurately assess your situation.\n\n2. **Consider Neurological Evaluation:**  If your doctor is concerned about the possibility of a seizure disorder, they may refer you to a neurologist.  Common tests include:\n   * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** Measures brain activity. Can help identify seizure activity, but sometimes comes back normal even if seizures are present.\n   * **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  Provides detailed images of the brain. Can reveal structural abnormalities that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n3. **Experiment with Reducing/Stopping Cannabis (under medical guidance):**  This is a challenging one, but if you\u2019re willing, a trial period of abstaining from cannabis could help determine if it's contributing to your symptoms. *Do not stop abruptly if you are a frequent user without talking to your doctor.*\n\n4. **Keep a Journal:**  Start a detailed journal documenting each episode, including:\n   * **Date & Time:**\n   * **Triggers:** What were you doing, thinking, or feeling *before* the sensation began?\n   * **Sensations:** Detailed description of *exactly* what you felt (physical and mental).\n   * **Duration:** How long did each phase last?\n   * **Aftereffects:** How did you feel afterwards?  How long did the aftereffects last?\n   * **Medication Dosage:** A reminder of what dosages of what medications you are currently on\n\n5. **Stress Management Techniques:** Explore stress reduction techniques like mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga. These can help manage underlying anxiety, which may contribute to dissociation.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\n\n*I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.* This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.

The possibility of seizures is a serious concern that requires professional evaluation.  Self-treating can be dangerous.\n\n\n\nI hope this thorough response is helpful.  Please prioritize seeing your doctor to discuss this further.  You've done a great job describing your experiences, and that will be valuable information for your healthcare provider."

        "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "\n\nOkay, this is a complex situation, and you're right to be persistent in looking for answers. You\u2019ve done a good job outlining a lot of important information. Let's break down the potential connection between your GERD/Hiatal Hernia/PPI use, weight lifting, the vagus nerve, and these episodes of passing out.  I'll try to be thorough, but **please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not medical advice.**\n\n**Understanding the Pieces**\n\n* **GERD & Hiatal Hernia:** A hiatal hernia is when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm. GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, irritating the lining.\n* **PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors):** These medications significantly reduce stomach acid production.  Long-term use (like your 22 years) can have various effects, which we'll discuss.\n* **Vagus Nerve:** This is a *very* important nerve.  It's the longest cranial nerve and has a huge range of functions, including controlling digestion, heart rate, blood pressure, and even breathing.  It's a major link between your brain and your gut.\n* **Weight Lifting/Exercise:** This creates a temporary increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and intrathoracic pressure (pressure within your chest). It also changes blood flow distribution - more to muscles, potentially less to the brain briefly.\n* **Syncope (Passing Out):** A temporary loss of consciousness, usually due to insufficient blood flow to the brain. There are many causes (cardiac, neurological, vasovagal, etc.).\n* **Epilepsy:** A neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.\n\n\n\n**How Weight Lifting *Could* Be Affecting the Vagus Nerve & Leading to Syncope (and why it relates to your GERD/PPIs)**\n\nThis is where it gets interesting, and where your intuition about the connection is worth exploring. Here's a breakdown of potential mechanisms:\n\n1. **Increased Intrathoracic Pressure and Vagal Stimulation:**\n   * **The Action:** Weight lifting, especially heavy compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press) dramatically *increases* pressure inside the chest. \n   * **The Vagus Nerve Connection:** The vagus nerve runs relatively close to the esophagus and stomach.  Increased pressure in the chest can directly stimulate the vagus nerve. \n   * **Vasovagal Syncope:**  Excessive vagal stimulation can lead to *vasovagal syncope*.  This is a common cause of fainting.  The vagus nerve slows your heart rate and dilates blood vessels in your legs.  Combined, this can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure and decreased blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting.  *This is the most likely scenario given your description.*  The timing *during* or *after* exercise strongly points toward this.\n\n2. **Hiatal Hernia & Vagal Nerve Compression:**\n   * **The Action:** Your hiatal hernia means a portion of your stomach is protruding into your chest cavity. During weightlifting, especially exercises that engage your core, this can potentially cause more mechanical pressure on the vagus nerve (or the esophagus near where it runs).\n   * **The Vagus Nerve Connection:** Compression or irritation of the vagus nerve can dysregulate its function and contribute to vagal syncope.\n\n3. **PPIs & Potential Exacerbation (This is complex \u2013 read carefully):**\n    * **Magnesium Absorption:** Long-term PPI use can *reduce* magnesium absorption. Magnesium is crucial for nerve and muscle function.  Low magnesium *can* contribute to dizziness, muscle cramps, and even cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) that could *potentially* lead to syncope.  While less common, it's worth investigating.\n    * **Gut Microbiome:** PPIs alter the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome has a direct link to the vagus nerve (the \"gut-brain axis\"). Alterations in the microbiome *could* theoretically affect vagal nerve function. *This is a more theoretical connection, but research is ongoing.*\n    * **Nitric Oxide Production:**  PPIs have been shown to reduce Nitric Oxide production in the stomach.  Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator (relaxes blood vessels). Reduced NO could potentially worsen blood pressure regulation during exertion. More study is needed on this.\n    * **Rebound Acid Hypersecretion:** When you stop PPIs, there\u2019s often a rebound effect where acid production temporarily *increases*. However, this is less relevant *during* exercise-induced syncope but could contribute to overall discomfort.\n\n4. **Exercise-Induced Blood Pressure Fluctuations:** While less likely given the normal cardiac tests, sudden and extreme fluctuations in blood pressure during lifting, combined with the other factors, could be problematic.\n\n\n\n**Why Previous Doctors Might Have Missed It**\n\n* **Focus on Cardiology/Neurology:** Cardiac testing often rules *out* heart problems; neurological testing often looks for *seizure activity*.  Neither necessarily investigates the vagus nerve specifically in relation to exercise-induced pressure changes and GERD.\n* **Siloed Medicine:**  Doctors often specialize (Cardiology, Neurology, Gastroenterology). It\u2019s easy to miss connections between systems when specialists don't collaborate fully.\n* **Rarity of the Combination:**  This isn\u2019t a textbook presentation.  The combination of long-term PPI use, hiatal hernia, and exercise-induced syncope is relatively uncommon, so it may not be immediately considered.\n\n\n\n**What Should You Do? (ACTIONABLE STEPS)**\n\n1. **Find a Doctor Who \"Connects the Dots\":**  Ideally, find a doctor (perhaps a *Physiatrist* \u2013 a doctor specializing in rehabilitation and physical medicine) who is willing to consider the *entire* picture, not just focus on their specialty.  Someone knowledgeable about vagus nerve function and autonomic nervous system disorders would be ideal.  A Gastroenterologist experienced with long-term PPI users is also important.\n2. **Detailed Episode Logging:** Keep a very detailed log of each episode:\n   * What exercise were you doing? (specific exercise, weight, sets, reps)\n   * What *exactly* did you feel beforehand? (lightheadedness, nausea, visual changes, etc.)\n   * What position were you in when it happened? (e.g., standing after a squat, lying back on the bench)\n   * How long did you lose consciousness (or feel completely out of it)?\n   * What did you feel *after* the episode?\n   * What did you eat/drink before the workout?\n3. **Magnesium Level Testing:** Ask your doctor to check your magnesium levels.  If low, discuss supplementation (under medical guidance!).\n4. **Consider a Trial of PPI Reduction (VERY CAREFULLY and with doctor supervision!):**  *Do not stop your PPI cold turkey!*  Your doctor may consider a *gradual* reduction in PPI dosage to see if it affects your symptoms, while closely monitoring your GERD. This is a delicate process and *must* be done under medical supervision.\n5. **Tilt Table Test with Vagal Maneuvers:** A repeat tilt table test *specifically* including vagal maneuvers might be useful.  A vagal maneuver (e.g., Valsalva), performed during the tilt test, could provoke a positive result if vagal hypersensitivity is contributing.\n6. **Explore Alternative Exercise Strategies:**\n    * **Avoid Valsalva:** Focus on proper breathing during lifting. Avoid holding your breath (\"Valsalva maneuver\"), as this dramatically increases intrathoracic pressure. Exhale during the exertion phase of the lift.\n    * **Modify Exercises:**  Consider modifying exercises to reduce the intensity or the amount of core engagement. Perhaps switch to machines instead of free weights for some exercises.\n    * **Gradual Progression:**  Increase weight/intensity very gradually.\n    * **Hydration and Electrolytes:**  Stay well-hydrated and ensure adequate electrolyte intake.\n7. **Biofeedback:** Certain biofeedback techniques can help you learn to regulate heart rate variability (HRV) and autonomic nervous system function.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.

        "answer": "Okay, this is a good, detailed history. Let's break down the information and think about potential areas to explore, especially given the recent emergence of your pancreatic issues.  I will preface this with a **very important disclaimer**: *I am an AI and cannot give medical advice. This is for informational purposes only, and you must discuss all of this with your gastroenterologist and neurologist.  They have your complete medical record and can best guide your care.*\n\n**Here's a breakdown, organized for clarity.

Key Medical Information & Concerns**\n\n*   **Epilepsy:**  This is significant. While Keppra (Levetiracetam) is generally well-tolerated, *some* research suggests a potential, though rare, association of levetiracetam use with pancreatitis. It's not a common side effect, but needs to be considered, especially given the timing relative to symptom onset.\n*   **Mild Chronic Pancreatitis (MCP):**  Elevated lipase levels (70-100) consistently suggest ongoing pancreatic inflammation/damage.  The randomness of attacks is important - idiopathic (unknown cause) pancreatitis is common, but we want to rule out treatable causes.\n*   **Medications:** Keppra twice daily and Vitamin D/Magnesium.\n*   **Background:** Formerly used alcohol & fast food to cope with anxiety. Now managed well through therapy. This is excellent.\n\n\n\n**2. Potential Contributing Factors & Areas to Explore with Your Doctors**\n\nHere's a section sorted by likelihood and importance for discussion:\n\n*   **Medication-Induced Pancreatitis:** *This is highest on the list to discuss.*  Specifically, discuss the potential (though rare) link between Keppra and pancreatitis with your neurologist and gastroenterologist.  They may consider a trial (under strict medical supervision, and *only* with their agreement) of switching to an alternative anti-epileptic medication if appropriate and if they believe it might be contributing. *Do not stop or change medication without your doctor's approval.*\n*   **Idiopathic Pancreatitis:** Often, no clear cause is found.  However, *don't settle for just \"idiopathic\" without thorough investigation.*\n*   **Biliary Tract Issues:** Even without gallstones (you haven't mentioned them, but need to confirm with your GI who has ordered investigations), microscopic sludge or a structural abnormality in the bile ducts can cause pancreatic inflammation.  An ultrasound, CT scan or MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) can visualize these structures.\n*   **Pancreas Divisum:** A congenital anomaly where the pancreatic ducts don't fuse properly. This can sometimes lead to pancreatitis. MRCP is the best test for this.\n*   **Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction:**  Problems with the valve controlling bile and pancreatic juice flow. Diagnosed with a special test called manometry (less commonly done).\n*   **Autoimmune Pancreatitis:**  An autoimmune process affecting the pancreas. Blood tests (IgG4 levels, etc.) can help diagnose this.\n*   **Genetic Predisposition:**  Family history of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer? Worth mentioning to your doctor.\n\n**3. Diet & Lifestyle - Refining What You're Already Doing Well**\n\nYou've already made fantastic strides in your dietary habits. Let's fine-tune.\n\n*   **Excellent Foundation:** Lean meat & 3+ veg at lunch/dinner is great.  Fruit smoothie for breakfast is okay, but think about protein content (see below).\n*   **Smoothie Critique:** Smoothies can be high in sugar (even from fruit) and lack significant protein, which can impact satiety and blood sugar control. *Consider adding a protein source* like unsweetened Greek yogurt (if dairy isn\u2019t an issue, even small amounts), protein powder (whey, soy, pea, rice \u2013 depending on preferences and sensitivities), or even a tablespoon of nut butter.\n*   **Fat Intake:**  Keep saturated and trans fats *very* low. While lean meat is good, portion control is important. Choose healthier fats like those found in avocado, nuts, and olive oil, but in moderation.  The pancreas has to work harder to process fats.\n*    **Fiber Intake**:  Ensure that you are including enough dietary fiber in your diet. Fiber can help to regulate digestive function and promote overall gut health.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink *plenty* of water throughout the day. This is important for overall health and pancreatic function.\n*   **Alcohol (Even Moderate):** While 2-7 drinks a week isn't excessive, *even moderate alcohol consumption can irritate an already sensitive pancreas.* Your GI might recommend complete avoidance, at least during the investigation phase. (You\u2019ve already done the hard work with managing anxiety \u2013 this is a Great sign).\n*   **Consider Digestive Enzymes:**  *Discuss this specifically with your gastroenterologist.*  Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) *might* be beneficial, even with mild chronic pancreatitis, to help with digestion and reduce pancreatic workload. Don't self-treat with these.\n*   **Vitamin Supplementation:** You're taking Vitamin D & Magnesium, which is good. Make sure your levels are regularly checked as pancreatic issues can sometimes affect nutrient absorption.\n\n\n\n**4. Important Questions for Your Gastroenterologist:**\n\n*   \"Given my epilepsy and Keppra use, could this be a potential contributor to my pancreatitis, and what investigations should be done to explore this?\"\n*   \"What specific tests have been done to rule out biliary causes (gallstones, sludge, structural issues)?\"\n*   \"Should I consider an MRCP to evaluate for pancreas divisum or other ductal abnormalities?\"\n*   \"Is testing for autoimmune pancreatitis warranted?\"\n*    \"Would you recommend a trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy?\"\n*   \"What are the next steps in determining the underlying cause of my pancreatitis, even if it's ultimately classified as idiopathic?\"\n*   \"Are there any specific dietary recommendations tailored to my situation, beyond what I'm already doing?\"\n\n\n\n\n**5. Monitoring & Tracking**\n*  **Symptom Journal:** Continue tracking when the pain occurs, its intensity, what you ate/did in the 24 hours prior, and any other accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting, bloating, changes in stool).  Detailed records are helpful for your doctor.\n\n\n\n**In summary:**  You're proactively managing your health, which is excellent. The key right now is to work closely with your medical team, *specifically* discussing the potential link with Keppra and pushing for a comprehensive investigation to pinpoint the cause of your pancreatitis.  Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask questions.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer Again:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.
