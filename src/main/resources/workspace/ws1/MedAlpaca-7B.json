We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",

Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnswer: 1) Seizures are diagnosed by history and EEG.  If you have had a seizure, and the EEG shows abnormal electrical activity, then you have epilepsy.  If you have never had a seizure, but the EEG shows abnormal electrical activity, then you have epilepsy.  If you have never had a seizure, and the EEG shows normal electrical activity, then you do not have epilepsy.\n2) The diagnosis of epilepsy is not based on the EEG.  The diagnosis of epilepsy is based on the history of seizures.  The EEG is used to help diagnose epilepsy.  The EEG is abnormal in epilepsy because of the brain's electrical activity during a seizure.  The EEG is normal in other conditions that cause seizures (such as migraine, headache, sleep disorders, etc.) because the abnormal electrical activity is not present during the EEG.\n3) The diagnosis of epilepsy is not based on age.  Epilepsy can be diagnosed at any age.  It is not uncommon for epilepsy to be diagnosed in infants and children.  It is also not uncommon for epilepsy to be diagnosed in the elderly.  Epilepsy is not diagnosed in young children because they have not had enough seizures to diagnose it.  Epilepsy is not diagnosed in the elderly because they are more likely to have other conditions that cause seizures (such as stroke, brain tumor, etc.)\n4) The diagnosis of epilepsy is not based on the number of seizures.  Epilepsy is diagnosed when you have had two seizures.  If you have had one seizure, and the EEG shows abnormal electrical activity, then you are said to have a provisional diagnosis of epilepsy.  If you have another seizure, then your diagnosis is confirmed.  If you do not have another seizure, then your diagnosis is considered to be in doubt, and you are followed closely.\n5) The diagnosis of epilepsy is not based on the severity of seizures.  Epilepsy is diagnosed when you have had two seizures.  If you have had one seizure, and the EEG shows abnormal electrical activity, then you are said to have a provisional diagnosis of epilepsy.  If you have another seizure, then your diagnosis is confirmed.  If you do not have another seizure, then your diagnosis is considered to be in doubt, and you are followed closely.\n6) The diagnosis of epilepsy is not based on the location of seizures.  Epilepsy is diagnosed when you have had two seizures.  If you have had one seizure, and the EEG shows abnormal electrical activity, then you are said to have a provisional diagnosis of epilepsy.  If you have another seizure, then your diagnosis is confirmed.

I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)\n\nAnswer: 1. Yes, you can donate plasma.\n2. No, you shouldn't donate plasma.\n\nThe answer to both of these questions is the same.\n\nThe reason you were turned away when you disclosed your epilepsy is because you were asked not to donate.  You were not turned away because of your epilepsy.  You were turned away because the plasma center had a policy that people with epilepsy cannot donate plasma.  That policy is reasonable.  Epilepsy is a contraindication for plasma donation.  The reason is that there is a risk of seizure during the donation process.  That risk is very low, but it is not zero.  If you were to have a seizure during the donation process, the plasma center would have to stop the donation process immediately, and you would be removed from the donation area.  That would be a serious safety issue for you and for the other donors.  It would also be a serious issue for the plasma center, because they would have to discard all the plasma you had donated.  That would be a lot of wasted plasma.  So, the plasma center has a policy that people with epilepsy cannot donate plasma.  That policy is reasonable.\n\nYou can donate blood.  You can donate platelets.  You can donate plasma.  You can donate bone marrow.  You can donate sperm.  You can donate eggs.  You can donate organs.  You can donate tissue.  You can donate hair.  You can donate bone.  You can donate skin.  You can donate corneas.  You can donate tendons.  You can donate ligaments.  You can donate veins.  You can donate kidneys.  You can donate liver.  You can donate lungs.  You can donate heart valves.  You can donate pancreas.  You can donate intestines.  You can donate skin.  You can donate everything except plasma."

It is thought that there is a problem with the electrical activity in your brain.  This electrical activity is normally controlled by your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.  When you are sleepy, your body produces more of a chemical called GABA, which helps to slow down the electrical activity in your brain.  When you are alert, your body produces less GABA, which helps to speed up the electrical activity in your brain.  It is thought that your seizures occur when there is too much electrical activity in your brain, and that this is related to the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nSource: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000517.htm\nI hope this helps."

I think you are describing a condition called Orthostatic Hypotension. It is a condition where the blood pressure drops too low when you stand up from a sitting or lying position. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and even fainting. It is usually caused by a problem with the autonomic nervous system, which controls the body's automatic functions.\n2. TIA's are a possible cause of stroke, but usually there is some symptoms before hand, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. It is possible that you have had a TIA and not realized it.\n3. Epilepsy can cause seizures, which can cause blackouts, but usually there is a specific type of seizure that causes this.\nI would recommend seeing a doctor to get checked out. They"

You have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and have been prescribed trazodone. You have been experiencing symptoms like headaches, tinnitus, floaters, memory problems, muscle twitches, sensitivity to light, dizziness, and visual disturbances. These symptoms are not typical of seizures. Seizures are characterized by uncontrolled and abnormal electrical activity in the brain which can cause loss of consciousness, muscle spasms, jerking movements, and changes in vision, hearing, and smell. You do not have these symptoms. I would suggest you to consult your doctor and get evaluated for your symptoms. You can discuss with your doctor about changing your medication. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."

She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.\n\nAnswer: 1. Sepsis is a serious infection that can be life-threatening.  It is a medical emergency.  It is important to treat the infection.\n2. Seizures are a symptom.  They are not a diagnosis.  The diagnosis is what is causing the seizures.  The doctor needs to determine the cause of the seizures.\n3. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are harmful or not.  If they are harmful, then the baby needs to be protected.  If they are not harmful, then the baby can be protected.\n4. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to the infection or not.  If they are related, then treating the infection may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then treating the infection may make the seizures worse.\n5. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low magnesium or not.  If they are related, then magnesium may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then magnesium may make the seizures worse.\n6. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low oxygen or not.  If they are related, then oxygen may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then oxygen may make the seizures worse.\n7. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low blood sugar or not.  If they are related, then sugar may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then sugar may make the seizures worse.\n8. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low blood pressure or not.  If they are related, then blood pressure medication may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then blood pressure medication may make the seizures worse.\n9. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low calcium or not.  If they are related, then calcium may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then calcium may make the seizures worse.\n10. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low sodium or not.  If they are related, then sodium may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then sodium may make the seizures worse.\n11. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low potassium or not.  If they are related, then potassium may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then potassium may make the seizures worse.\n12. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low glucose or not.  If they are related, then glucose may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then glucose may make the seizures worse.\n13. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low protein or not.  If they are related, then protein may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then protein may make the seizures worse.\n14. The doctor needs to determine if the seizures are related to low albumin or not.  If they are related, then albumin may stop the seizures.  If they are not related, then albumin may make the seizures worse.\n15"

It is not possible for a lesion to shrink.  It is possible for a lesion to resolve, but that would be due to some other process, such as scar tissue formation.  It is also possible for a lesion to remain the same size, or for there to be a new lesion.  The MRI is not sensitive enough to detect lesions smaller than a certain size.  It is possible that you have a lesion that is too small to see on the MRI.  It is also possible that you have a lesion that is not in the same location as the previous MRI.  It is possible that you have a new lesion.  It is also possible that you have a lesion that is not causing seizures.  It is possible that you have a lesion that is causing seizures, but that is not the only lesion that is causing seizures.  It is possible that you have a lesion that is causing seizures, and that is the only lesion that is causing seizures.  It is possible that you have a lesion that is causing seizures, and that is the only lesion that is causing seizures, and that lesion is shrinking.

I would suggest you try to swallow the 500 mg tablet with a glass of water or juice. If that doesn't work, you can try crushing the tablet and sprinkling the contents on a spoonful of applesauce or pudding. Be sure to stir it well so that you don't get lumps. You can then swallow the mixture. If you are still having problems, you can speak to your doctor about reducing the dose."

Topiramate is not a carbon copy of Trokendi XR. It is a different medication with a different mechanism of action. So, you may need to titrate the dose of topiramate to the same level as you were on trokendi XR.\n2. Topiramate is not an extended release formulation. It is a once-daily medication."

I would be very skeptical that this is happening at all.  I would recommend that you have your sister talk to the doctor about this, and ask them to observe the child in the office to see if they have any signs of fainting.  If they do, then they can do some tests to see if there is a medical reason for it.  If they don't, then they can reassure your sister that it is not a problem."

Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers.

I have never heard of a case like this before.\nThe most likely explanation is that the nausea and vomiting were caused by the stress of living in a haunted house.\nThe fact that the symptoms stopped immediately after you moved out suggests that the cause was a psychological rather than a physical phenomenon.\nI would suggest that you do not mention this to the new owners or the real estate agent. It will only cause them unnecessary stress."

No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",

I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps.

My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,\n\nAnswer: 1) You should be working with a physical therapist.  They can test your strength and range of motion and help you develop a program.  They can also help you with balance and coordination.\n2) You may have a weakness on one side due to the surgery, but it is unlikely that it is the cause of your weakness.  It is more likely that you have a weakness due to not using the arm.  The brain is a plastic organ and will adapt to the use you give it.  If you don't use it, it will get weaker.  This is true of both arms.  If you have a weakness, it is likely due to a lack of use.\n3) You can do exercises to help improve the strength and range of motion.  You can also do balance and coordination exercises.  You can do these with or without a therapist.  You can also do them on your own.  You can find many of these exercises on you tube.  There are also many books on the subject.  I recommend \"Acing the PT test\" by PT Whiteside.  It is a little pricey, but you can find it used.  It is a good reference book."

I\u2019m really up for any suggestions right now because I want to go back to my normal life. thank you!\n\nAnswer: 22 years old and so much going on! I am so sorry to hear about all of this. I am a nurse practitioner and have worked in neurology for 10 years. I will try to help you make some sense of this.\nFirst, I am glad you are on Keppra for your seizures. This is a good medication. It is important to know that seizures can be a side effect of hormonal changes, so being on birth control is not a bad thing. It is also important to know that seizures can be a side effect of a lot of medications. I am glad you are off of the birth control.\nThe fluttering of your heart is called palpitations. This can be related to stress, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, certain medications, and anxiety. It is important to know if you are having palpitations at the same time of your seizures. If so, then this is something you should discuss with your doctor.\nThe fluttering of your heart can also be related to your tachycardia. Tachycardia is a condition where your heart rate is over 100 beats per minute. This can be related to stress, caffeine, nicotine, and anxiety. It can also be related to your epilepsy. It is important to know if you are having tachycardia at the same time of your seizures. If so, then this is something you should discuss with your doctor.\nThe fluttering of your heart can also be related to your electrolyte levels. Electrolytes are minerals in your blood that help your heart, nerves, and muscles function. It is important to know if you are having palpitations at the same time of your seizures. If so, then this is something you should discuss with your doctor.\nThe fluttering of your heart can also be related to your thyroid. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that helps regulate your metabolism. It is important to know if you are having palpitations at the same time of your seizures. If so, then this is something you should discuss with your doctor.\nThe fluttering of your heart can also be related to your adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of your kidneys and help regulate your stress response. It is important to know if you are having palpitations at the same time of your seizures. If so, then this is something you should discuss with your doctor.\nThe fluttering of your heart can also be related to your blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of"

Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs.

The tingling and numbness in the face and limbs could be related to a condition called peripheral neuropathy. This is a nerve problem that can be caused by a variety of conditions, including diabetes, infections, autoimmune disorders, vitamin deficiencies, and exposure to toxins.\n2. The motor tics and convulsions could be related to a condition called Tourette's syndrome. This is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent, rapid, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor and vocal tics.\n3. The EEG is a test that is not very sensitive for detecting seizures. It is more sensitive for detecting abnormal brain waves during sleep, but it is not sensitive for detecting seizures during wakefulness. Seizures can be detected by other tests, such as the ambulatory EEG (a test where the patient wears a small device that records brain waves for a period of time) or the longer, more invasive test of a brain biopsy.\n4. The motor tics and convulsions could be related to a condition called Tourette's syndrome. This is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent, rapid, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor and vocal tics.\n5.

The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon.

A bad trip is a side effect of using marijuana that is unpleasant and can cause anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, etc.  It is not a typical side effect of the medications you are taking, so it is possible that the bad trip was caused by the marijuana itself.  It is also possible that the bad trip was caused by something else, such as a mild form of psychosis that is unrelated to your medications.

I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.

Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold.

I would suggest you see a neurologist.\n2) You are describing sleep paralysis.  This is a common symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy.  Again, I would suggest you see a neurologist.\n3) You are describing a seizure.  This is a common symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy.  Again, I would suggest you see a neurologist."

It is possible that you have a problem with your eyes that is causing the dizziness.  It is also possible that the dizziness is caused by a problem with your inner ear.  The second thing to do is to get a copy of your driver's license and take it to your doctor.  Ask your doctor to write a note saying that you have a medical condition that causes dizziness when you drive at night.  Take the note to the DMV and ask them to put it in your driver's license file.  That way, if you are ever stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation, the officer will know that you have a medical condition that causes dizziness and will not give you a ticket."

You should not take two antidepressants together.  Prozac and lamictal are both antidepressants.  You should not take both of them together.  It is possible that the combination of the two medications caused the seizure.  You should stop taking the lamictal and call your doctor.\n2. You should eat more.  You should eat more often and make sure you are eating enough food.  You should not skip meals.  You should talk to your doctor about your appetite.  There are medications that can help with appetite.\n3. You should not smoke weed.  Weed is a drug.  It can cause seizures.  It can also cause you to faint.  It is not good for you.  It is not healthy.  It is not good for your mental health.  It is not good for your physical health.  It is not good for your life.  It is not good for your future.

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",

It is a low dose. 1 g of Keppra is also a low dose. 25 mg of lamotrigine is a very low dose. 250 mg of Keppra is a low dose. 1 g of clobazam is a high dose. \nYou need to be on a higher dose of lamotrigine and a higher dose of Keppra. You also need to be on a higher dose of clobazam. \nYou need to see a new neurologist."

I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.\n\nAnswer: 1) You are correct that epilepsy can be genetic.  However, it is not always inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion.  That is, not all cases of epilepsy are caused by a single gene.  Instead, there are many different types of epilepsy, and many of them are caused by a variety of different mechanisms.  Some are genetic, some are acquired, and some are idiopathic (meaning no cause is known).  The specific type of epilepsy that you have is probably idiopathic.\n2) The cause of epilepsy is not always known.  In fact, most cases of epilepsy are idiopathic, and the cause is never found.  This is true even for children who are born with epilepsy.  In some cases, the cause may be known, but it is not always the cause.  For example, some cases of epilepsy are caused by brain damage, but the brain damage may have been caused by a variety of factors, including injury, infection, stroke, tumor, or genetic disorders.  In other cases, the cause may be known, but it is not the cause.  For example, some cases of epilepsy are caused by a variety of metabolic disorders, but the disorder itself is not the cause of the epilepsy.  Instead, the disorder is a symptom of the underlying cause.  In other cases, the cause may be known, and it may be the cause of the epilepsy, but it is not the cause of the symptom.  For example, some cases of epilepsy are caused by brain tumors, but the tumor itself is not the cause of the seizures.  Instead, it is the pressure that the tumor puts on the brain that causes the seizures.\n3) The cause of epilepsy is not always known.  This is true even for children who are born with epilepsy.

I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!\n\nAnswer: 1. Seizures are not a common side effect of antidepressants, but there is a very small risk of seizures with any medication.  The most common antidepressant associated with seizures is Tegretol (carbamazepine).  The other antidepressants you are taking, Wellbutrin and Cymbalta, are not associated with seizures.  If you are having seizures, you should stop taking the Wellbutrin and Cymbalta and see a neurologist.  It is possible that the seizures are related to your depression.  If the seizures are not related to your depression, then you may need to be on a different antidepressant.  If you are having seizures, you should not be using marijuana.  It is possible that the marijuana is causing the seizures.  If you are having seizures, you should not be using any recreational drugs.  You should be seen by a neurologist.  You should also see a rheumatologist to rule out lupus.  You should also see a dermatologist to rule out other causes of dry skin and mouth sores.  You should also see"

It is also more than 10 times the upper limit of normal for a 55 year old. It is likely that you have a significant blood loss somewhere. It could be from the GI tract, the kidney, or the bladder.

It is a side effect of many medications, including mirtazapine. It is also a side effect of Parkinson's disease.\n2. The white spots on your brain are likely from T2-weighted MRI sequences. They are not a sign of MS.\n3. The cause of your eye tremor is unknown. It is not a side effect of any medication. It is not a sign of MS. It is not a seizure. It is not a sign of Parkinson's disease. It is not a sign of exhaustion. It is not a sign of anything. It is just there. It is called intention tremor. It is a rhythmical oscillation of the eyes that occurs when you are trying to keep them open. It is a benign condition."

Basically, I have these head jerks where it feels like theres a pulse of electricity in the back of my head usually in the base of my skull on the left side. And my head jerks back and I make a grunting sound, sometimes I jerk back twice. This has been happening for about 10 years but it gets worse when I\u2019m off my meds. But the past week I haven\u2019t really been sleeping and I\u2019ve had the flu and I\u2019ve been unable to twitch and it\u2019s like the feeling is building up in the back of my head and its getting really uncomfortable and making it sometimes hard to breathe. Sometimes painful. The feeling is completely involuntary, kind of like a sneeze, and it feels like when you can\u2019t sneeze. What should I do? My neurologist doesn\u2019t listen to me. I have a GP appointment in 2 days, should I talk to her about it?\n\nAnswer: 1) You should definitely talk to your GP about this.

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",

My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290\n\nAnswer: 250 mg of Lamotrigine is a very high dose for someone your age.  I would recommend consulting with your doctor about possibly lowering the dose.  It is possible that the high dose is causing more side effects than necessary.  It is also possible that the high dose is preventing the seizures, but the seizures are not occurring because of another trigger.  It is important to find the right dose for you.\nAs for the game, it is impossible for us to know if it will trigger a seizure or not.  It is possible that the game is perfectly fine for you, but it is also possible that it is the trigger.  I would recommend consulting with your doctor about this.  They can help you determine if the game is safe for you or not."

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed with EA2 after an unexpected hospital stay. Of course I have been researching the condition, and came across 4-AP. I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won\u2019t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn\u2019t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",

You would need to contact the manufacturer to see if you can get it."

I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ?

Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel?

How would this likely play out?\n\nAnswer: 1) Yes, it is likely that they will continue to do liver function tests, but they may also do a renal function panel.\n2) The reason for doing the liver function tests is that the Topamax can affect the liver.  The reason for doing the renal function panel is that the Keppra can affect the kidneys.  So, they are checking to make sure that the medications are not affecting the organs in a negative way.\n3) If you have any other medical conditions, they may also do a complete blood count (CBC) to check your overall health."

I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint a tender lymph node in the occipital region can be due to infection, inflammation or tumor. You need to get an FNAC test done to confirm the diagnosis. Till then you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole. You can also take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor."

        "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help. It's killing us all with her\u2026",

I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",

Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone is a term used to describe an enlarged 3rd ventricle. It is a common finding in patients with epilepsy.\n2. T2 high signal gliosis is a term used to describe an area of inflammation in the brain. It is a common finding in patients with seizures.\n3. Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus likely refers to the fact that the hippocampus is abnormal in shape or size.\n4. Associated regional atrophy likely refers to the fact that the hippocampus is not alone in this abnormality, but that other areas of the brain have also been affected.\n5. Periventricular white matter refers to the white matter that surrounds the ventricles. It is likely normal.\nIn summary, it sounds like the MRI shows that the hippocampus is abnormal in shape or size, and that there is evidence of past inflammation in the brain."

It is difficult to give a diagnosis without examining you, but I can give you my opinion based on your description. Your symptoms are suggestive of a condition called oscillopsia. It is a condition in which there is a perception of movement of the visual field, even in the absence of actual movement of the environment. It is usually caused by a problem in the inner ear, but can also be caused by other conditions such as multiple sclerosis or seizures. I would recommend that you see an ophthalmologist specialized in neuro-ophthalmology, who can perform a complete eye examination and order the necessary tests to investigate for possible causes. I hope to have been of help. Best wishes,"

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",

Cutis verticis gyrata is a skin condition where the hair follicles are oriented in a spiral fashion. It is associated with mental retardation.\n2. The seizures and deafness are not related.\n3. The ridges in your scalp are probably from the chemotherapy."

It is not clear if this is due to the seizures or the medications.  The seizures may cause brain injury and the medications may cause brain atrophy.  The good news is that memory improves in many patients when the right medication is found.\n2) Spelling and speech problems are not common with epilepsy.  They are more common with brain injury or stroke.  Again, the medications may cause these problems.\n3) Forgetting things is common with epilepsy.  It is not clear if this is due to the seizures or the medications.  The seizures may cause brain injury and the medications may cause brain atrophy.  Again, the medications may cause these problems.\n4) Seizures can cause a variety of symptoms.  They can cause a lack of breathing, loss of consciousness, and other symptoms.  The seizures may cause brain injury and the medications may cause brain atrophy.  Again, the medications may cause these problems.\n5) The best way to answer these questions is to have a comprehensive neurological evaluation.  This should include an MRI of the brain, an EEG (brain wave test), and a detailed neuropsychological evaluation.  This will help determine the cause of your symptoms."

The LD50 (the dose that kills 50% of the subjects) is 1200 mg/kg.  So you would need to consume 58000 mg, which is 58 grams to kill half of the people who ingest it.  That is a lot of Kendra.  The symptoms of overdose of Kendra include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and ringing in the ears.  If you are lucky, that is all you will get.  If you are unlucky, you may get more serious symptoms such as seizures, coma, or even death.  The symptoms will depend on the dose and the individual.  If you have any underlying medical conditions, it may be a good idea to talk to your doctor about the overdose."

But I would actually say I have good oral hygiene. Could this be related to one of my diseases, or could it be a side effect or something completely unrelated? I've already asked one of my doctors but he had no idea what this could be (out of his field). Which doctor would you suggest visiting, a dermatologist? I'm hoping to find someone here to help me out. I would be thankful for any ideas about what this might be, how to reduce the pain (except for standard painkillers) or to prevent it completely. Compared to my diseases it's not really that bad of course, but another annoying thing that might trigger despair.\n\nAnswer: 1. This is a condition called glossitis. It is an inflammation of the tongue. It can be due to many reasons including deficiencies, infections, allergies, trauma, etc.\n2. It is not related to any of the diseases you have.\n3. You can reduce the pain by avoiding spicy, acidic and sharp foods. Use a soft toothbrush to brush your tongue. Use a tongue scraper to remove the coating.\n4. To prevent it, maintain good oral hygiene."

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",

The symptoms you describe are not typical of seizures.  I would suggest that you have your cousin evaluated by a neurologist.  It is possible that she has a movement disorder such as Tourette's syndrome or a neurological disorder such as epilepsy.  It is also possible that she has a psychiatric disorder such as anxiety or depression.  It is important to get a correct diagnosis so that she can receive appropriate treatment."

Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.\n\nAnswer:  Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Encephalomalacia is a condition where there is loss of brain tissue due to ischemia or infarction. Gliosis is a condition where there is abnormal proliferation of glial cells in the brain. Both of these conditions are usually seen in conditions where there is loss of brain tissue. Encephalocele is a condition where there is protrusion of brain tissue through a defect in the skull. The MRI report suggests that there is a region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the region where the encephalocele was repaired. This is a common finding after surgery for encephalocele. The gliosis is a part of the normal healing process where the brain tissue gets replaced by glial cells. The MRI report does not mention any epileptogenic focus, so it is unlikely that the seizures are due to this region of gliosis. The seizures could be due to the underlying craniosynostosis or the genetic variant. The best way to determine the cause of seizures is by performing an electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain mapping. I hope this information is helpful. Best wishes, Chat Doctor."

Hi, the MRI report is normal. There is no bleed or infarct. There are few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right. This is probably related to ischemia. 2. Ischemia can be due to hypoperfusion or embolism. Hypoperfusion can be due to hypertension, diabetes, or any other cause. Embolism can be due to atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, or any other cause. 3. Ischemia can cause demyelination. 4. Ischemia can cause seizures. 5. You are already on good medicines. You can continue them. 6. You can discuss with your doctor about these findings. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",

I will focus on the seizures, as that is the most concerning symptom.  The most common cause of seizures in a 31 year old female is typically absence seizures.  These are seizures that present as staring spells, and are often mistaken for daydreaming.  They are caused by a specific type of abnormality in the brain, and are often associated with a specific gene.  If this is the case, then other family members should be tested.  If the seizures are not typical absence seizures, then other causes should be considered, such as stroke, brain tumor, infection, or other brain disorders.  The other symptoms you mention are concerning, and should be evaluated by a neurologist.  It is important to have a detailed and thorough workup to determine the underlying cause."

        "question": "My mum (45F, 165cm, 80kg, non drinker, non smoker) moved from India to Australia in 2006. She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing. It has impacted her lifestyle/QoL immensely over the last decade and it is getting worse so if anyone has advice on different ways we can manage this, we would be grateful. Whether it is seeing a different medical specialist, allied health practitioners or things we can implement to ensure her safety. Thank you.",

It is not uncommon for seizures to be triggered by stress, anxiety, flashing lights, sleep deprivation, lack of food, etc.  So, it is possible that the stress of being in India caused an increase in seizures.  It is also possible that the stress of being in India caused a change in medication requirements.  It is possible that the stress of being in India caused a change in medication compliance.

From the history you have provided, it seems that you have developed a hematoma at the site of injury. This is a collection of blood under the skin. It will take some time to resolve. You can apply ice to the area and keep taking rest. It will gradually resolve. If it does not resolve in a few weeks, you can consult a surgeon for its removal. Hope this helps. Regards"

I would look for a neurologist who is familiar with epilepsy and see if they can help.  There are a number of medications that can cause unconsciousness, including some antidepressants.  I would also look at her thyroid function and have her check her blood sugar.  If she is not diabetic, I would check her fasting glucose.  If it is low, she should eat something and then check it again.  If it is still low, she should see her doctor.  If it is normal, she should repeat the test in a few days.  If it is still normal, she should see her doctor to see if she is anemic.  If she is anemic, she should eat more red meat and see if that helps.  If she is diabetic, she should see her doctor.  If she is not diabetic, she should repeat the test in a few days.  If it is still normal, she should see her doctor to see if she is anemic.

I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",

Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?\n\nAnswer: 1. Seizures and TIA are two different things.  TIA is a temporary loss of blood flow to the brain.  It is not a seizure.  It is a warning sign that you are at risk for a stroke.  A stroke is a blockage of blood flow to the brain.  A seizure is abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  It is not a blockage of blood flow.  So, no, a TIA is not a seizure.  A TIA is a warning sign that you are at risk for a stroke.  A stroke is a blockage of blood flow to the brain.  A stroke can cause seizures.  So, yes, a TIA can cause a seizure.  The initial episode you are referring to sounds like a TIA.  The fact that you had a lesion on your brain is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you had a loss of consciousness is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you had a convulsion is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you had an episode that was like an electric shock is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you had an episode that was like an electric shock in your right hand followed by a similar sensation on the left side of your head is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you fell unconscious is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that the EMTs were called is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you were told that no neurosurgeon is going to operate on the lesion is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you were scared is a sign that you had a TIA.  The fact that you were referred to a neuro-oncologist is a sign that you had a TIA.

They are very common.  They can be caused by stress, lack of sleep, caffeine, alcohol, or any number of other things.  They are not seizures.  Seizures involve uncontrolled and unpredictable muscle movements.  These are controlled and predictable.  They are not uncommon.  Everyone has them.  The fact that you are noticing them now is just that you are paying more attention to them.  They are not a cause for concern."

He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy.

Some idea?\n\nAnswer: \n\nI read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?\n\nI think you have witnessed a stroke. \n\nA stroke is a sudden and temporary disruption of blood supply to the brain. When the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, brain cells (neurons) begin to die off within minutes. The symptoms depend on the location and extent of the brain damage.\n\nThe symptoms of stroke include:\n\n- sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)\n- sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech\n- sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\n- sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination\n- sudden trouble reading or writing\n- sudden trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or decision-making\n- sudden unexplained fever\n- sudden unexplained pain, especially in the face, arm, or leg\n- sudden unexplained tears or drooping of the eyelid\n- sudden unexplained trouble swallowing\n- sudden unexplained difficulty breathing\n- sudden unexplained loss of consciousness\n\nSource: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001567.htm\nThe disturbing laughter is a typical symptom of stroke. \n\nLaughter is a common reaction to a stroke. It may occur in up to 1/3 of all patients. It is thought to be caused by the disruption of the blood vessels to the brain.\n\nSource: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003217.htm\nI would suggest you to read more about stroke at the links I provided."

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",

Doctors have no idea why I lost my appetite and can't keep food downSo I really don't know how to explain this without sounding absolutely insane.\n\nAnswer: 6-10 silent seizures a day is a lot. I'm not a doctor, but I've had a few friends with epilepsy, and they don't have that many seizures a day. I would definitely get a second opinion on that.\nGastroparesis is a condition where the stomach takes a long time to empty its contents into the small intestine. It can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and a nerve disorder called diabetic neuropathy.\nBrain zaps are a type of seizure, but they're not the kind of seizure that causes convulsions. They're called an absence seizure. They're characterized by a person suddenly staring blankly into space for a few seconds. They're usually not dangerous, but they can be disruptive to daily life.\nI'm not sure why you're having seizures or why you're losing your appetite. It could be a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, a brain tumor, a brain infection, or a brain injury. I would recommend seeing a neurologist."

I would recommend that you see a psychiatrist for an evaluation and treatment.  It is possible that you have a seizure disorder, but it is also possible that your symptoms are not related to seizures.  It is also possible that you have a mild form of epilepsy that does not cause you to lose consciousness.  However, it is unlikely that you have a brain tumor.  The symptoms you describe are not suggestive of a brain tumor.\n2. You should not worry your parents.  They are already worried about you.  You should not worry them more.  You are an adult.  You can see a psychiatrist without your parents' permission.  If you are not an adult, then you should tell your parents that you are worried and that you want to see a psychiatrist."

I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started. I\u2019m really just making a post to gather more insight and experiences from doctors and other people as well. If anyone has any insight as to what could be causing this, it would be much appreciated. This diagnosis has kinda knocked me on my ass, as I can\u2019t drive for 6 months after my last seizure.

I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started. I\u2019m really just making a post to gather more insight and experiences from doctors and other people as well. If anyone has any insight as to what could be causing this, it would be much appreciated. This diagnosis has kinda knocked me on my ass, as I can\u2019t drive for 6 months after my last seizure.

Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

The cause of the cirrhosis is likely the alcohol. 5. The cause of the alcoholism is likely psychiatric. 6. The solution to the problem is to stop drinking."

It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance\n\nAnswer: 1. The rash could be an allergic reaction to the IV medications. 2. You should make an appointment with your doctor to determine if the rash is related to the IVs. 3. You can try an over the counter antihistamine such as Ben Chat Doctor."

        "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)?

It is a brief, easily administered, and reasonably sensitive and specific test of cognitive impairment. The MMSE is a 30-point test that assesses orientation, memory, attention, and language. The clock drawing test is a screening test for dementia of the visuospatial abilities. It is a simple test that requires the subject to draw a clock face in 10 minutes. The clock test is a screening tool for dementia of visuospatial abilities. It is a simple test that requires the subject to draw a clock face in 10 minutes.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003217.htm\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003217.htm\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003217.htm"

Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and an inability to resist sleep.  Cataplexy is the loss of all muscle tone after a strong emotional stimulus or after a startle.  It is caused by the loss of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.  The diagnosis is made by a sleep specialist.  Treatment is with sodium oxybate (Gabarone) at night and a stimulant during the day (e.g. modafinil).  2. Raynaud's phenomenon is a disorder of the blood vessels that causes them to constrict excessively in response to cold or emotional stress.  Treatment is with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine. 3. Urge incontinence is a type"

I have read your question and understand your concerns. Let me try to help you Question : What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? Answer : Hippocampal sclerosis is a condition in which the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is involved in learning and memory, becomes damaged or scarred. This can result in memory loss and other cognitive problems. The prognosis depends on the cause of hippocampal sclerosis. If the cause is treatable, the prognosis may be good. If the cause is untreatable, the prognosis may be poor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Neurology only wants to repeat an mri once per year to rule out ms\n\nAnswer: 1) I'm not sure what you mean by \"rhabdomyolysis\".  It sounds like you have a condition that is causing muscle damage, and that is causing your CK levels to rise.  The fact that your CK levels are high is not necessarily a sign of muscle damage.  It's possible that your CK levels are elevated for other reasons.  For example, if you have a condition that is causing muscle damage, your CK levels may not rise until after the damage has occurred.  If you have a condition that is causing muscle damage, you need to find out what it is.  You need to find out what is causing the muscle damage, and then you need to stop it from happening.  If you don't know what is causing the muscle damage, then you need to find out.  You need to find out what is causing the muscle damage, and then you need to stop it from happening.

The diagnosis of epilepsy is not based on the symptoms alone. It is based on the clinical investigations and EEG. \n2. The symptoms you have described are more likely to be related to panic attacks. \n3. The treatment of epilepsy is not Lamictal. Lamictal is used for seizures. \n4. The treatment of panic attacks is CBT and SSRIs. \n5. I suggest you to consult a psychiatrist for the treatment of panic attacks."

I've had a number of patients with asthma and/or allergies who have had great success with it.  It's also used to treat other fungal infections, such as PCP pneumonia.\nThe key is to make sure you're getting the right dose, and to make sure you're taking it with plenty of fluids.  It's also important to make sure you're taking it with a medication that will protect your kidneys.  If you're not already on one, you may want to consider taking a medication like Bactrim or Levaquin while you're on the amphotericin B.  That will help protect your kidneys.\nThe other thing to watch for is a condition called hyperkalemia.  That's when your potassium levels get too high.  That can cause all sorts of problems, including muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, and even heart attack.  If you have any symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or irregular heartbeat, you need to call your doctor right away."

During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\".

His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times.

About 160lbs and 5'6\n\nAnswer: 120 ml of Pepto-Bismol Max is 1200 mg of bismuth.  The LD50 of bismuth in rats is 2.5 g/kg, so you would have to drink 5000 ml (500 ml * 10) to reach the LD50.  That's 5000 mg or 5 g of bismuth.  That's 250 times the recommended dose.  You're not going to die from this.  You're not even going to get close.  You're not even going to get sick.

        "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",

She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible\n\nAnswer: 6 months is not a long time to have a vaccine reaction.

Dizziness, visual problems, and salt cravings are not typical symptoms of epilepsy.  I would suggest you see your doctor to have your medication checked.  It is possible that the dizziness is related to the alcohol consumption.  I would also suggest you stop drinking alcohol.\n2. The weight fluctuations are concerning.  You need to see a doctor to have your thyroid checked.  You may need to have a TSH test and an T3/T4 test.  You may need to be on a low dose of Synthroid.\n3. The salt cravings are not typical of epilepsy.  You may need to have your electrolytes checked.  You may need to be on a low sodium diet.\n4. You need to see a doctor to have your blood pressure checked.  You may need to be on a low salt diet.\n5. You need to see a doctor to have your blood sugar checked.

There are a number of alternative therapies that have been shown to be effective in treating epilepsy.  These include:\n\nKetogenic diet\nVitamin B6\nValerie root\nFish oil\nCoenzyme Q10\n\n2.  There are also a number of alternative therapies that have not been shown to be effective in treating epilepsy.  These include:\n\nChiropractic\nAcupuncture\nHomeopathy\n\nThe best way to find out if a treatment is effective is to read the research.  There is a lot of research on alternative therapies for epilepsy.  You can find it by searching PubMed, which is a database of medical research.

It is called \"dissociation\".  It is a feeling of detachment from reality, and it is a hallmark of severe depression.  It is also a symptom that is treated with antidepressants.  I am not sure if it is related to your ECT, but it is a good idea to discuss this with your doctor.  I hope that this helps."

She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",

I would not be concerned at this point.  I would also not be concerned about the UTI.  I would be more concerned about the cefixime.  Cefixime is an antibiotic that is used to treat a UTI.  It is also used to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  I would be concerned that she may have developed an adverse reaction to the antibiotic.  I would recommend that you contact your doctor and have her stop the antibiotic.  If the sleep disturbances continue, I would recommend that you have her evaluated by a sleep specialist."

It takes 4-6 weeks for the full effect to be seen. If you are still depressed after that time, then it is time to consider other options.\nI would suggest that you talk to your doctor about adding something else to your treatment. There are a number of options, including adding an anti-psychotic, bupropion, or mirtazapine.\nIt is not safe to stop taking an antidepressant without talking to your doctor. Stopping suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms, including worsening depression."

I think you should not worry much. Seizures are controllable with medications. If the seizure occurred because of the brain injury from the stroke, it will remain controlled with the medication. The chances of having a breakthrough seizure are very low. I think you should not worry much. You should let your child be a kid. You can install cameras to monitor him. I think you should not worry much. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

        "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",

I don't know of any cage or walker that would be able to do that.  I would suggest you look into a wheelchair or stroller that has a restraint system.  You can find some that have a 5 point harness system that would be able to hold him in place.  You can also look into a backpack style restraint system.  I would not recommend a bungee cord or rope type system.  It would be too easy for him to slip out of and it would not be able to hold his weight."

It is important to determine the cause of these lesions. The most common causes of such lesions are hepatocellular carcinoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and focal autoimmune hepatitis. The fact that the largest lesion is in segment 6 of the right lobe is also concerning. Segment 6 is the most common site for hepatocellular carcinoma. The fact that the lesions enhance arterially is also concerning. Focal nodular hyperplasia and focal autoimmune hepatitis would not enhance arterially. The fact that the lesions appear to be hyperintense on T2 is also concerning. Hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia would not be hyperintense on T2. The fact that there is no definite washout is also concerning. The fact that the lesions appear to enhance less than background vessels on delayed phases, arguing against hemangioma, is also concerning. The fact that there are multiple lesions is also concerning. The fact that you have a history of chronic pancreatitis is also concerning. It is important to determine the cause of these lesions as soon as possible. You should see a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further evaluation."

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum. Not sure which suspicions have been correct lmao. EEG RESULTS - I wasn't sent the literal results, only the documents.

I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?\n\nAnswer: 1) This is a neurological condition called focal seizure with impaired awareness.  It is a type of seizure that starts in one part of the brain and causes numbness and tingling.  It is not the same as an epileptic seizure, which is a generalized seizure that can involve loss of consciousness and convulsions.  You are correct that the cause is unknown, but it is not psychological.  It is not a headache that causes the seizure, but rather the seizure causes the headache.  The headache is a symptom of the seizure.  The good news is that it is not dangerous, and you are not going to die.  The bad news is that it is very difficult to predict when it will happen and there is no way to prevent it.  You can read more about it here: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000511.htm\n2) The headache that you get with this type of seizure is likely a migraine.  You can read more about migraines here: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000757.htm\n3) The best thing to do is to keep a diary of when and where these episodes occur.  You should also keep a diary of your headaches.  This will help your doctor determine if there is a pattern to the seizures and migraines.  You should also tell your doctor about the breathing exercises that you do that seem to help.  This will help your doctor determine if there is a connection.  You should also tell your doctor about any medications that you are taking, including over the counter medications.  Some of these can interact with seizure medications."

Tics are not the same as myoclonic jerks. Tics are repetitive, stereotyped, nonrhythmic, nonrhyming, nonrepetitive motor and verbal (e.g. grunting) sounds and movements that occur at regular intervals. \n2. Clonazepam is not used to treat ADHD. It is used to treat seizures and panic attacks. \n3. Clonidine is used to treat ADHD. \n4. Tetrabenazine is used to treat tics. \n5. You should be worried about your situation because you have not been properly evaluated. You need to be evaluated for seizures, and you need to be evaluated for a movement disorder. \n6. You should not be taking 4 medications at once. \n7. You should be evaluated by a movement disorder specialist."

You may need to work up to 5-10mg before you feel the full effects.  It may take a few weeks to a few months to find your therapeutic dose.  You may need to titrate up to 20-30mg.  You may also need to take it with food to prevent the nausea.  If you are still having air hunger, you may need to try Adderall.  It is a stimulant, but it is also used for ADHD.  It may take a few weeks to a few months to find your therapeutic dose.  You may need to titrate up to 60mg.  You may also need to take it with food to prevent the nausea.

I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES.

I would have your doctor check your blood pressure and do an EEG.  If your blood pressure is elevated, you may be experiencing a form of PNES that is triggered by autonomic dysregulation.  If your blood pressure is normal, then you may be experiencing a form of PNES that is triggered by epilepsy.  An EEG would help determine if you have epilepsy.\n3) I would also recommend that you see a neurologist to help determine the cause of your symptoms."

Is palatal myoclonus treatable?\n\nAnswer:  Palatal myoclonus is a rare form of myoclonus that is characterized by muscle twitching in the soft palate. It is usually caused by a lesion in the brain that is either congenital or acquired. It can be caused by a stroke, tumor, infection, or degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  Treatment for palatal myoclonus depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is a medication, the medication can be changed or the dose reduced. If the cause is a neurological disorder, treatment may involve medications such as baclofen, benzodiazepines, or botulinum toxin injections.  In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected tissue."

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in.

Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?\n\nAnswer: \n\nThe vagus nerve is the longest of the cranial nerves, arising from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem and passing through a number of ganglia en route to the abdomen and pelvis. It is a mixed nerve, containing motor, sensory, and autonomic fibers.\n\nThe vagus nerve is involved in regulating heart rate, digestion, respiration, and other bodily functions. It is also involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety.\n\nThere is some evidence that stimulation of the vagus nerve may have therapeutic effects in certain conditions, such as epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed.\n\nIt is not clear whether stimulating the vagus nerve has any general health benefits, as claimed by some manufacturers of vagus nerve stimulation devices. There is no evidence that these devices are effective or safe.\n\nIn summary, while there is some evidence that stimulation of the vagus nerve may have therapeutic effects in certain conditions, and there is some interest in developing this approach further, there is no evidence that stimulating the vagus nerve has general health benefits."

I also had some \u201cleft neglect\u201d symptoms but that\u2019s normal for me when I get migraines because my left side goes numb so I related all of this to stress & the migraines until I started having muscle twitching in my left hand & wrist. - I started to improve end of March but My vision is still off sometimes & I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be. I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me? No one has ever told me I had radiation necrosis. I guess I was always under the assumption my brain would heal itself after my radiation\u2026 but 4 years later it just seems to be getting worse. Does radiation necrosis heal/is it dangerous? Could this just be swelling? Did is progress fast from January 2022-April 2023? 4.. Since I\u2019m not getting blood flow there is it basically the same thing as a ischemic stroke? What is FLAIR hyperintensity? Those are just questions off the top of my head.

It is a slow process that can take years to develop. It is not dangerous, but it is irreversible.\n2. The MRI report is not clear. It is not possible to tell from the report if the lesion is new or has been there for a long time.\n3. The FLAIR hyperintensity is a signal abnormality in the white matter. It is not dangerous.\n4. It is difficult to say if the lesion has progressed. It is possible that the lesion is new.\n5. There is no treatment for radiation necrosis."

They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better?

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream.

That is good.\n2. The EEGs are abnormal.  That is also good.\n3. The temporal lobe epilepsy is a diagnosis of exclusion.  That is, all other possible causes of the EEG abnormalities have been ruled out.  That is also good.\n4. The temporal lobe epilepsy is probably not the cause of your other symptoms.  That is, the abnormal EEGs are probably not due to seizures in the temporal lobe.  That is also good.\n5. The abnormal EEGs are probably due to psychiatric disorders.  That is, the abnormal EEGs are probably due to depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia.  That is also good.\n6. The abnormal EEGs are probably due to psychiatric medications.  That is, the abnormal EEGs are probably due to the anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medications you are taking.  That is also good.\n7. The abnormal EEGs are probably due to sleep deprivation.  That is, the abnormal EEGs are probably due to not getting enough sleep.  That is also good.\n8. The abnormal EEGs are probably due to alcohol or illicit drug use.  That is, the abnormal EEGs are probably due to alcohol or illicit drug use.  That is also good.\n9. The abnormal EEGs are probably due to a medical condition.  That is, the abnormal EEGs are probably due to a medical condition other than epilepsy.  That is also good.\n10. The abnormal EEGs are probably due to epilepsy.

        "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo.

It is not epilepsy, but a transient seizure.  It is a transient because it is short-lived and does not cause any lasting effects.  It is a seizure because it is a synchronous firing of the brain that is out of the normal pattern.  It is triggered by something in the environment, in this case, a stimulus that reminds you of something from the past.  The stimulus causes a memory to be recalled, and the memory causes a cascade of brain activity that is not normally there.  The brain is attempting to process the memory, but it is not able to do so, and this causes the transient seizure.  It is not a common type of seizure, but it is a type of seizure nonetheless.  It is called an autosuggestion seizure.  It is a benign condition.  You are not going to die from it, and it is not going to cause any lasting damage.  It is just a bit disconcerting.  It is not something that you need to worry about.  You can read more about it here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19752444"

Should I be worried?\n\nAnswer: \n\nIt's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now).\n\nIt's very unlikely that a stun gun would cause epilepsy.  Epilepsy is a brain disorder that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  A stun gun is not capable of causing that kind of brain damage.  It's more likely to cause a heart attack, but that's not what you're worried about.\n\nShould I be worried?\n\nNo, you should not be worried.  Epilepsy is not a life-threatening condition.  It's not even a serious condition.  It's just a nuisance.  It's not like you're going to die or anything.  It's just that you might have a seizure.  And if you have a seizure at work, you might get fired.  That's the worst that could happen."

I was prescribed something called KAMPO (I guess it's Chinese medicine) but it didn't have an effect. Now, he prescribed me \"SELENICA-R 40%\" which is usually used for epileptics.

Thank you.\n\nAnswer: 9 seizures in one day is a lot. I would recommend that you see a neurologist immediately. You need to have an EEG and MRI of the brain to determine the cause of your seizures.  You may need to be on a medication that is more potent than Keppra.  You may need to have a lobectomy (removal of a section of the brain) if the seizures are coming from a specific area.  You may also need to have a vagus nerve stimulator implanted if the seizures are not controlled with medication.  The vagus nerve stimulator is a device that is implanted under the skin and sends electrical impulses to the brain to stop the seizures.  I hope this helps."

All comments appreciated :) Thanks in advance\n\nAnswer: 1) Alcohol and seizures\nAlcohol is a central nervous system depressant.  It can lower the seizure threshold, meaning that you are more likely to have a seizure when you drink.  It can also affect the effectiveness of antiepileptic medications.  So, in general, it is not recommended that you drink alcohol.\n2) How much you can drink\nThe amount you can drink is different for everyone.  Some people can drink a lot and not have any problems, while others can have a small amount and have a seizure.  It depends on the type of seizure you have, the type of alcohol you drink, and the amount you drink.  It also depends on the medications you are taking.  You should talk to your doctor about how much you can drink.\n3) Do I need to make changes\nYou should not drink alcohol.  It is not worth the risk of having a seizure.  If you have a seizure, it could be dangerous.  You could fall and hurt yourself or someone else.  You could drown if you have a seizure in the bathtub or pool.  You could be arrested if you have a seizure in public.  You could have other medical problems if you have a seizure.  You could even die."

Does epilepsy increase brain related diseases with time?\n\nEpilepsy does not increase the risk of brain related diseases. Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are episodes of abnormal and excessive electrical activity in the brain. They can cause changes in sensation, movement, and behavior.\n\n2. Are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost?\n\nSeizures and part seizures are not bad for the brain.

I am not sure what to make of your symptoms.  It is possible that you have a seizure disorder that is not well controlled.  It is also possible that you have a different disorder that causes some of the symptoms you are having.  I would recommend that you see a neurologist for an evaluation.  An EEG would be a good test to see if you have seizure activity.  Other tests such as an MRI of the brain may also be helpful.  It is important to know for sure what is going on so that you can be treated appropriately."

They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine?

Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause anemia, which can cause fatigue and weakness.  It is possible that this is the cause of your fatigue.  It is also possible that there is another cause of your fatigue, and that this is unrelated to your vitamin levels.\n2. Epilepsy itself is not affected by vitamin levels.  However, some antiepileptic medications can affect vitamin levels.  For example, levetiracetam (Keppra) can cause low vitamin D levels.  It is possible that your epilepsy is not well controlled with your current medication.  You should discuss this with your doctor.\n3. Iron deficiency anemia can cause fatigue, but it is unlikely that this is the cause of your fatigue.  Your ferritin level is low, but your serum iron level is normal.  If you are a woman of childbearing age, you may have low ferritin because you are losing iron through menstruation.  However, this is not likely to cause fatigue.\n4. There is no known connection between folate and iron deficiency."

Seizures can be provoked by fever, sleep deprivation, flashing lights, video games, etc.  It is not uncommon for a seizure to occur hours after the precipitating event.  This is why it is important to keep a seizure diary.\n2. Yes, the abnormal EEG is a sign of epilepsy.  It is not uncommon for the EEG to be normal between seizures.\n3. There are many causes of epilepsy.  The most common are stroke, brain injury, brain tumor, infection, genetic, and unknown.  The cause is unknown in about 50% of cases.  If there is a known cause, it is usually treatable.  If there is no known cause, it is called idiopathic.  The cause does not need to be found in order to treat the seizures.\n4. The Depakote is a good choice.  It is a mood stabilizer as well as an anti-epileptic.  It is generally well tolerated.  It is unlikely to cause hair loss.  Liver toxicity is uncommon if the dose is kept within the recommended range.  It is unlikely to cause behavior changes.  It is unlikely to cause growth retardation.  It is unlikely to cause birth defects.  It is unlikely to interact with other medications.  It is unlikely to interact with CBD.  It is unlikely to be affected by diet.  It is unlikely to be affected by sleep deprivation.  It is unlikely to be affected by flashing lights.  It is unlikely to be affected by video games.  It is unlikely to be affected by fever.  It is unlikely to be affected by sleep.  It is unlikely to be affected by stress.  It is unlikely to be affected by menstrual cycle.  It is unlikely to be affected by pregnancy.  It is unlikely to be affected by breastfeeding.  It is unlikely to be affected by age.  It is unlikely to be affected by weight.  It is unlikely to be affected by eye color.  It is unlikely to be affected by hair color.  It is unlikely to be affected by eye or hair style.  It is unlikely to be affected by sunlight.  It is unlikely to be affected by moonlight.

        "answer": "25f, chronic anxiety with 7.5mg buspar, ADHD 20mg adderall, acid reflux and Barrett\u2019s mucosa with omeprazole, IBS with dicyclomine.History of epilepsy consisting of one gran mal at age 8, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called but it started as seizures in my legs at age 7, and a couple absence due to high fever. My last seizure was at age 11 and it I didn\u2019t have anymore after starting my period at 12.Day before yesterday I was going into work at 6 and took my adderall then. I had an espresso drink and ate espresso beans going into my shift as well. I work at a dive bar and usually we\u2019ll take shots after work/ during our shift. This was my third day there so it was my third day drinking that night.I got home from work around 1am and woke up at 5 and was wide awake. I felt like I was having an aura like that \u201cdeja vu\u201d feeling about having a seizure. Around 7 I was still wide awake and turned over onto my stomach and for a good 20 seconds I couldn\u2019t move, open my eyes, or speak. Sound was extremely amplified and my skin and muscles felt like they were vibrating but with no convulsions. I was wide awake and anxious until this happened so I don\u2019t think it was sleep paralysis.After I came to, my body and mind felt very exhausted. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I was groggy the entire day and today I\u2019m feeling down mentally. Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?\n\nAnswer: 1. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain.  They can be caused by many things, including fever, sleep deprivation, certain medications, and metabolic disturbances.  They can also occur for no known reason.  They can be associated with a variety of symptoms, including muscle twitching, jerking, and spasms, as well as loss of consciousness.  They can occur in any part of the body.  They can be associated with a variety of sensations, including deja vu, and can be associated with a variety of sounds.  They can occur in people with or without a history of seizures.  It is impossible to diagnose a seizure without a thorough neurological examination.  If you are having seizures, you should see a neurologist.  If you are not having seizures, but are concerned that you might be having them, you should see a neurologist.  If you are not having seizures, but are concerned that you might be having them, you should see a neurologist.  If you are not having seizures, but are concerned that you might be having them, you should see a neurologist."

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",

The ribs are likely bruised.\n3. The lung is likely uninjured.\n4. The pain will likely resolve in a few days.\n5. If the pain persists, get a chest x-ray."

I am not a neurologist, but I can tell you that surgery is not the first line of treatment for epilepsy. \n2. The tests you mentioned are not necessary. You can have an EEG and an MRI of the brain. \n3. If you have seizures, you should be on medication. \n4. If you are not on medication, you should have a video-EEG to localize the focus of seizures. \n5. If the focus is localized, you can have surgery. \n6. If the focus is not localized, you should continue with medication. \n7. If you are on medication, and you have no seizures, you can stop medication. \n8. If you are on medication, and you have no seizures, you can have surgery. \n9. If you are on medication, and you have no seizures, you can have a baby. \n10. If you are on medication, and you have no seizures, you can stop medication. \n11. If you are on medication, and you have no seizures, you can have a baby. \n12.

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had?

The current medications are appropriate. \n3. The EEG changes are consistent with temporal lobe seizures. \n4. The diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis is not supported by the spinal fluid studies. \n5. The immunotherapy was appropriate."

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested?

It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",

It is also used to treat bipolar disorder.  It is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of autism.  It is not approved for the treatment of ADHD.  It is not approved for the treatment of PDD.  It is not approved for the treatment of 15q26.1 microdeletion.  It is not approved for the treatment of bowlegs.\n2) The FDA has approved the following medications for the treatment of epilepsy:  ethosuximide, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and topiramate.  Valproate is not one of them.  The FDA has not approved any medication for the treatment of ADHD.  The FDA has not approved any medication for the treatment of PDD.

I'm not sure what that means, but it could be anything from a seizure disorder to a psychiatric disorder.  You should ask your neurologist."

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator. I am also unsure if much of a difference in medical treatment and testing between San Diego and Tijuana. Something is better than nothing and the staff in TJ were all very nice. I know I am rambling. I just hope someone can help. Thank you.",

Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures?

The fact that you have had strokes and brain surgery and still have seizures is not that unusual.  Many people with epilepsy have had other neurological conditions.\n2)  I think you are having seizures at work.  The fact that you have an aura before the seizure is very typical.  The aura can be subtle, and it is possible that you are not aware of it.  It is also possible that you are aware of it, but that it is not typical.  For example, you may be aware of the aura, but not be aware that it is an aura.  You may be more aware of the aura during the seizure.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to recognize it as an aura.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to associate it with the seizure.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to remember it later.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it to anyone else.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it to anyone else because you don't know what it is.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it to anyone else because you don't know what it is and you don't know how to describe it.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it to anyone else because you don't know who to ask.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it to anyone else because you don't know who to ask and you don't know how to describe it.  You may be aware of the aura, but not be able to describe it to anyone else because you don't know who to ask and you don't know how to describe it and you don't care.\n3)  I think you are having seizures at work.

        "question": "33 Year Old Male, 5 Feet 7 Inches, about 165LB, Caucasian, Persistent headache varying in intensity, lasting months. Epileptic. Started with Essential Tremor at ~12-13. Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history.

The seizures are unlikely to be causing your problems, as you haven't had any for a long time.  The EEG is normal.  The fact that you had a head injury that caused a cracked helmet is not likely to be the cause of your problems.  That was a long time ago, and head injuries don't cause PTSD.  PTSD causes headaches.  The PTSD is causing your anxiety, depression, concentration problems, and fatigue.  The PTSD is also causing your insomnia.  The PTSD is causing your nightmares.  The PTSD is causing your flashbacks.  The PTSD is causing your avoidance.  The PTSD is causing your hypervigilance.  The PTSD is causing your irritability.  The PTSD is causing your anger.  The PTSD is causing your guilt.  The PTSD is causing your numbing.  The PTSD is causing your self-blame.  The PTSD is causing your self-esteem problems.  The PTSD is causing your startle response.  The PTSD is causing your hyperarousal.  The PTSD is causing your hypervigilance.  The PTSD is causing your nightmares.  The PTSD is causing your night terrors.  The PTSD is causing your night sweats.  The PTSD is causing your flashbacks.  The PTSD is causing your dissociation.  The PTSD is causing your amnesia.  The PTSD is causing your depersonalization.

Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally.

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen?

I have gone through your question and understand your concerns.\nSleep paralysis is a condition where a person is unable to move when they are in between the stages of wakefulness and sleep. It is a common condition and is usually not a cause for concern. It is not a seizure and is not dangerous.\nIt is important to understand that sleep paralysis is not a seizure. Seizures are a neurological condition where there is abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can be caused by a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, head injuries, infections, and metabolic disturbances.\nSleep paralysis is not a seizure.

So basically it lasts about 5-10seconds and it's where I do something normal and then I recognize soenthing (like deja Vu) then shortly after my head begins to hurt and I get really dizzy and it brings me to a memory (it's the same memory when I always get these episodes) and then after 10 second me have gone I completely forget what that memory was. Now that is not what concerns me. But I've had this other type and I've had it twice so far..The first time maybe in May..and I wake up for work and I feel completely dazzed off..but then I'm okay..dad drives us into work and then I get so nauseous..I go home and I take a nap..I'm okay.. The next day my co worker tells me that he saw me and I told him I didn't recognize him and that I didn't know what to do..(I kind of remember it but not really).Now the reason why I'm writing this is because I had a crash recently and I woke up feeling that exact same way..I go to work and I'm with my mum and we crash into a wall and the car is totalled.. I remember 5minutes before the crash and I remember 5seconds being in the ambulance and a bit in hospital but my memory of the past week before that went..

I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air. It's so embarrassing and it makes me anxious to fly. Thank you so much for any input!!",

I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise.

Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear.

The brain is particularly sensitive to lack of oxygen and can be damaged by even a few minutes of oxygen deprivation.  The brain damage can be temporary or permanent.  It can result in a number of different symptoms, including ADHD, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, seizures, and developmental delays.  It can also result in death.\n\nI have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit)\n\nThis is a common symptom of brain damage, including birth asphyxia.  The brain damage can result in abnormalities in the part of the brain that controls vision and can cause photosensitivity (sensitivity to light).  It can also result in seizures."

Good, balanced diet and drink a lot of water. No drugs.Concerns: bad family history of cancer - quality of life affected.In Norway. What should I look out for to justify going to the doc? I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

Your symptoms are concerning for a possible electrolyte imbalance.  I would recommend seeing your doctor for an evaluation.  It is possible that you are experiencing a condition called SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion).  This is a condition where the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone, which can cause fluid retention and dilutional hyponatremia (low sodium).  This can cause symptoms such as lightheadedness, fatigue, and confusion.  It is important to get checked out by a doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n2.

It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",

Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
