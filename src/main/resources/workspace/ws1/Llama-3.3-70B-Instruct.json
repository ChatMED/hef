        "answer": "I'm glad you're seeking advice! Given your history and symptoms, I'll offer some insights, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional. It's essential to continue consulting your neurologists and other healthcare providers for personalized guidance.\n\n**Seizure and medication side effects:**\nYour neurologists have suggested that the seizure might have been a side effect of your anxiety medication. This is a plausible explanation, as some medications can lower the seizure threshold. However, it's crucial to discuss with your neurologists and psychiatrist (if you have one) about the potential risks and benefits of continuing or changing your medication.\n\n**Dizziness and disorientation while gaming:**\nThe new symptoms you're experiencing, such as dizziness and disorientation while gaming, could be related to several factors:\n\n1. **Visual sensitivities:** Although you're used to flashing lights, it's possible that your brain is processing visual information differently after the seizure. Gaming can involve intense visual stimuli, which might be triggering your symptoms.\n2. **Eye strain:** Your neurologists mentioned eyestrain as a potential cause. Prolonged screen time, especially in a gaming context, can lead to eye fatigue, dryness, and discomfort, which might contribute to your symptoms.\n3. **Anxiety and dissociation:** Your pre-existing anxiety and dissociation issues might be exacerbating your symptoms. The immersive nature of gaming can sometimes worsen anxiety, leading to feelings of disorientation or dissociation.\n4. **Other possible factors:** Other potential contributing factors could include dehydration, sleep deprivation, or underlying conditions like migraines or vestibular disorders.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Consult your neurologists and psychiatrist:** Share your concerns and symptoms with your healthcare providers. They may want to reassess your medication, investigate other potential causes, or refer you to additional specialists (e.g., an ophthalmologist or otolaryngologist).\n2. **Take regular breaks while gaming:** Try taking breaks every 20-30 minutes to rest your eyes, stretch, and move around. This can help reduce eye strain and give your brain a chance to recover.\n3. **Adjust your gaming setup:** Ensure your gaming environment is comfortable, with proper lighting, seating, and screen settings. Consider using blue light filtering glasses, adjusting the color palette, or reducing the frame rate to alleviate visual stress.\n4. **Monitor your symptoms:** Keep a symptom journal to track when your dizziness and disorientation occur, including the duration and any potential triggers. This can help you and your healthcare providers identify patterns and potential contributing factors.\n5. **Anxiety management:** Continue working on your anxiety and dissociation issues through therapy, relaxation techniques, or mindfulness practices. This can help you develop better coping mechanisms and reduce your overall stress levels.\n6. **Consider a follow-up EEG:** If your symptoms persist or worsen, you may want to discuss with your neurologists the possibility of another EEG to rule out any underlying seizure activity or other neurological conditions.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your health and consult with your healthcare providers regularly to ensure you're receiving the best possible care."

        "question": "25M, Caucasian, 172cm, 77kg, fit and athletic, do lots of sports, no previous illnesses or conditions, head injury when I was 4 years old with no obvious consequencesDuring summer of 2018, I had my first what doctors described consciousness crisis. We were about to go rafting and I was walking in my wet suit through very cold water while it was very hot outside. My friends said that I just collapsed down and fell into the water. Last thing I remember was walking and then I just woke up on the river bank with everyone around me. I had blood coming out of my mount because I bit my tongue quite badly. I had no recollection of what happened and I was very confused and had no idea where I was or what year it is. Was taken to a hospital and they did an ecg and xray of my lungs and head and they also ran a blood test. Everything was in good order. The night before I didn't get the best sleep and we also drank a couple of beers.Fast-forward 2 years and 7 months, celebrating new year with my friends. I had just 1 beer and took a couple of puffs of weed. We had a long and good sleep and the next day we went on a little road trip. Everything was fine up until the evening. I was sitting on a couch and my friends said that I just let out a heavy suppressed scream and I collapsed on to the floor hitting my head on the corner of the table (still got a little scar). Woke up after 10 minutes confused AF because it felt like time travel. They took me to the hospital and I hot a CT scan of my head and urine an blood test and again everything was okay. The next day I went to a neurologist and he ordered an EEG after a sleepless night and an MRI and once again everything was totally fine. He das prescribed me 50mg of Lamotrigin to take in the morning and evening 25mg each (50mg in total).Now for almost 3 years I had no issues. Important to note that before the first seizure and after the first seizure I have experienced almost every epilepsy trigger multiple times. I went to rave parties and raved for 12 hours straight with flashing light while drunk and hungry. Listened to loud music, had sleepless nights, smoked week, have been blackout drunk amongst other things.So I am incredibly confused as to why have I collapsed twice in this 2,5 year period.Does this count as epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide an analysis of your situation, but keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and only a qualified doctor can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nYou've experienced two episodes of loss of consciousness, which were described as \"consciousness crises\" by doctors. These episodes share some common factors:\n\n1. **Stressful conditions**: Both episodes occurred in situations that might be considered stressful, such as walking in cold water while hot outside (first episode) and celebrating New Year's Eve with some alcohol and cannabis use (second episode).\n2. **Possible triggers**: Although you've been exposed to various potential epilepsy triggers (e.g., flashing lights, loud music, sleep deprivation, substance use) without issue, it's possible that a specific combination of factors contributed to these episodes.\n3. **Normal diagnostic tests**: Extensive diagnostic testing, including ECG, X-rays, blood tests, CT scans, EEG, and MRI, has not revealed any underlying conditions or abnormalities.\n\nThe fact that you've had no issues for almost 3 years and have been able to tolerate potential epilepsy triggers without incident suggests that epilepsy might not be the primary cause of your episodes. However, the neurologist's decision to prescribe Lamotrigine, an antiepileptic medication, implies that they considered the possibility of epilepsy or seizure-like activity.\n\nThere are a few alternative explanations to consider:\n\n1. **Acute symptomatic seizures**: These are seizures that occur in response to a specific, immediate cause, such as a head injury, infection, or substance use. In your case, the combination of factors like cold water, heat, and substance use might have contributed to the seizures.\n2. **Nonepileptic seizures**: These are episodes that resemble seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can be related to psychological or physiological factors, such as stress, anxiety, or other medical conditions.\n3. **Other medical conditions**: Although your diagnostic tests were normal, it's possible that an underlying condition, such as a cardiac or neurological disorder, might be contributing to your episodes.\n\nTo better understand your situation, you may want to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult a neurologist or epileptologist**: Discuss your episodes and test results with a specialist to determine if they believe you have epilepsy or if another explanation is more likely.\n2. **Keep a seizure diary**: Track any potential triggers, symptoms, and episodes to help identify patterns or correlations.\n3. **Explore other potential causes**: If your doctor suspects an underlying condition, you may need to undergo additional testing or evaluation to rule out other possibilities.\n\nRemember, a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified medical professional. It's essential to work with your doctor to determine the cause of your episodes and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

Any existing relevant medical issues bone infection (being treated) chest pain after 3 epilepsy attacks within 2 weeks and every time under influence of drugs, thats what worries me.Current medications 3 types of antibiotics.  Include a photo if relevant",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not capable of viewing or including photos, but I can provide you with a general assessment based on the information provided.\n\nGiven your symptoms and medical history, it's essential to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Recent epilepsy attacks**: The fact that you've had three epilepsy attacks within two weeks, especially under the influence of drugs, suggests that drug use might be a trigger for these seizures. It's crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider to understand if the seizures are directly related to the drug use or if there could be an underlying condition that's being exacerbated by the substances.\n\n2. **Chest pain**: This symptom, in combination with your history of epilepsy and drug use, requires immediate medical attention. Chest pain can be indicative of several serious conditions, including cardiac issues. The fact that you're taking three types of antibiotics suggests you're being treated for an infection, which could potentially affect your heart (e.g., endocarditis in severe cases), especially if the infection is bacteremia (blood infection).\n\n3. **Bone infection**: You're being treated for a bone infection, which indicates your immune system is currently compromised. The use of three antibiotics suggests the infection is being aggressively managed, but it's also a reminder that your body is in a vulnerable state.\n\n4. **Drug use**: The influence of drugs during each seizure episode is a significant concern. Substance use can lower the seizure threshold, making it easier to have seizures, and can also complicate the management of epilepsy and other medical conditions.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n\n- **Seek immediate medical evaluation** to assess the cause of your chest pain and to review your current treatment plan for your bone infection and epilepsy.\n- **Discuss your drug use openly** with your healthcare provider. The information about drug use is crucial for providing accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. It might be necessary to adjust your medications or consider rehabilitation programs.\n- **Review your medication list** with your healthcare provider to ensure that the combination of antibiotics and any potential anti-epileptic drugs you might be prescribed do not have adverse interactions with the substances you're using.\n- **Consider consulting a neurologist** to evaluate and manage your epilepsy, especially given the recent frequency of seizures and the potential link to drug use.\n\nIt's paramount to address both the physical health issues and the substance use comprehensively to manage your condition effectively."

        "question": "My husband (40M) had his first (that we know of) seizure - it was a tonic-clonic seizure - about a month ago. He had an EEG and is awaiting MRI.Before getting the EEG, his neurologist said he most likely doesn't have epilepsy due to his age and since he has only had one seizure. But after she received his EEG results, she said he does have epilepsy and needs to start medication. Everything I've read says that epilepsy is not diagnosed until after two seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly misdiagnosed. I have been trying to learn about EEGs and epilepsy, but I'm not entirely clear on how they diagnose the condition. Is there a specific electrical firing seen that takes place that means it is absolutely epilepsy? Or is it just if you have an abnormal EEG then they guess it's epilepsy and not something else?I definitely have some questions for the neurologist, but I don't want to throw out the idea of misdiagnosis unless I have a basis to stand on. Any information and insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Diagnosing epilepsy can be complex, and it's great that you're doing your research to better understand your husband's condition. I'll try to break down the diagnosis process and the role of EEGs in epilepsy diagnosis.\n\n**Epilepsy diagnosis:**\nYou're correct that epilepsy is typically diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that are not caused by another underlying medical condition. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines epilepsy as \"a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate seizures.\" However, the diagnosis can be made after a single seizure if the EEG and other diagnostic tests suggest a high likelihood of recurrent seizures.\n\n**EEG and epilepsy diagnosis:**\nAn EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain. In people with epilepsy, the EEG may show abnormal electrical discharges, such as:\n\n1. **Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs):** These are abnormal electrical spikes or sharp waves that occur between seizures. IEDs are often seen in people with epilepsy, but they can also be present in individuals without the condition.\n2. **Focal or generalized slowing:** Abnormal slowing of brain waves can indicate underlying brain damage or dysfunction.\n3. **Spike-and-wave discharges:** These are characteristic of certain types of epilepsy, such as absence seizures.\n\nWhile an abnormal EEG can suggest epilepsy, it's not a definitive diagnosis. EEGs can be abnormal in people without epilepsy, and some individuals with epilepsy may have a normal EEG.\n\n**Diagnosis based on EEG:**\nA neurologist will consider the following factors when interpreting an EEG:\n\n1. **Type and location of abnormal discharges:** The type and location of abnormal electrical activity can suggest the presence of epilepsy.\n2. **Frequency and severity of discharges:** The frequency and severity of abnormal discharges can indicate the likelihood of recurrent seizures.\n3. **Clinical correlation:** The neurologist will consider the patient's clinical history, including the type and frequency of seizures, to determine if the EEG findings are consistent with epilepsy.\n\n**Is there a specific electrical firing pattern that diagnoses epilepsy?**\nThere is no single, specific electrical firing pattern that definitively diagnoses epilepsy. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical evaluation, EEG findings, and other diagnostic tests, such as MRI.\n\n**Abnormal EEG and differential diagnosis:**\nAn abnormal EEG can be caused by various conditions, such as:\n\n1. **Other neurological disorders:** Conditions like multiple sclerosis, cerebral vasculitis, or encephalitis can cause abnormal EEGs.\n2. **Medication effects:** Certain medications, such as sedatives or antipsychotics, can alter EEG readings.\n3. **Sleep deprivation or drowsiness:** These can cause abnormal EEG patterns.\n4. **Technical issues:** EEG equipment or technician errors can lead to false positives or false negatives.\n\n**Your questions for the neurologist:**\nYou're right to seek clarification on the diagnosis. Here are some questions you may want to ask the neurologist:\n\n1. What specific EEG findings led to the diagnosis of epilepsy?\n2. How do the EEG results correlate with my husband's clinical history and seizure type?\n3. What other diagnostic tests or evaluations are planned to confirm the diagnosis?\n4. What are the potential risks and benefits of starting medication, and what are the alternatives?\n5. How will we monitor my husband's condition and adjust treatment as needed?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll be able to better understand the diagnosis and treatment plan, and you'll be empowered to advocate for your husband's care.\n\nRemember, it's essential to have an open and informed discussion with the neurologist to ensure that your husband receives the most appropriate care. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you're unsure about the diagnosis or treatment plan."

        "question": "ale, (controlled) epilepsy, lamotrigine 450 mg a day, average height and weight. I\u2019m wondering what the opinion is for a person with epilepsy to donate plasma? I was turned away once when I disclosed my epilepsy to the people there, but I\u2019m wondering why. I\u2019ve had 5 seizures in almost 20 years, the most recent being April 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a legitimate, medical reason I shouldn\u2019t donate plasma? Thank you :)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide an overview of the medical perspective on plasma donation for individuals with epilepsy.\n\n**General Guidelines:**\nThe eligibility criteria for plasma donation vary by country and donation center. In the United States, the FDA regulates plasma donation, and the specific guidelines are outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 640). While there isn't a specific section addressing epilepsy, the guidelines emphasize the importance of donor safety and the quality of the donated plasma.\n\n**Epilepsy and Plasma Donation:**\nThe primary concern with epilepsy and plasma donation is the potential risk of transmitting infectious agents, such as viruses, through the donated plasma. However, epilepsy itself is not considered a contagious or infectious condition.\n\nThe FDA guidelines recommend that donors be deferred (temporarily or permanently) if they have a medical condition that may pose a risk to the recipient or compromise the safety of the donated plasma. In the case of epilepsy, the concern is not the epilepsy itself but rather the potential presence of other underlying conditions that may be associated with epilepsy, such as:\n\n1. **Increased risk of bleeding or coagulopathy**: Certain antiepileptic medications, like valproate, may affect blood clotting. However, lamotrigine, which you're taking, is not typically associated with an increased bleeding risk.\n2. **Medication interactions**: Some antiepileptic medications may interact with other medications or substances, potentially affecting the quality of the donated plasma.\n\n**Your Specific Situation:**\nConsidering your history of well-controlled epilepsy, with only 5 seizures in almost 20 years, and your current medication regimen (lamotrigine 450 mg/day), it's likely that your epilepsy is not a significant concern for plasma donation.\n\nThe fact that you were turned away once may be due to an overabundance of caution or a misinterpretation of the guidelines. It's possible that the donation center was erring on the side of caution, given the complexities of epilepsy and the potential for underlying conditions.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nIf you're still interested in donating plasma, you may want to:\n\n1. **Consult with your doctor**: Discuss your epilepsy and medication regimen with your primary care physician or neurologist. They can provide guidance on your individual situation and potential suitability for plasma donation.\n2. **Contact a different donation center**: Reach out to another plasma donation center and ask about their specific eligibility criteria for donors with epilepsy. They may have a more nuanced understanding of the guidelines and be willing to consider your donation.\n3. **Inquire about specific requirements**: Ask the donation center about any additional requirements or precautions they may need to take, such as monitoring your medication levels or seizure history, to ensure your safety and the quality of the donated plasma.\n\nKeep in mind that the decision to accept or reject a plasma donor ultimately rests with the donation center, and they may still choose to defer you due to their internal policies or procedures.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand the medical perspective on plasma donation with epilepsy. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"

        "answer": "Having a history of temporal lobe epilepsy, especially with a surgical intervention, can indeed raise questions about its relevance to your current health. Here's a balanced view to consider:\n\n**Why it's still relevant:**\n\n1. **Residual effects:** Although you haven't had a seizure since surgery, there's a small chance that you might still experience some residual effects, such as cognitive or memory issues, which could be related to the surgery or the underlying condition.\n2. **Future risks:** While rare, it's possible that you might experience a seizure in the future, especially if you have other health conditions or take certain medications that could lower your seizure threshold.\n3. **Interactions with other health conditions:** Your history of epilepsy might be relevant when interacting with other health conditions, such as migraines, head injuries, or certain infections, which could potentially trigger seizures.\n\n**When it's likely not relevant:**\n\n1. **Minor procedures or routine care:** For routine check-ups, vaccinations, or minor procedures, your history of epilepsy might not be directly relevant, especially if you've been seizure-free for an extended period.\n2. **Non-neurological conditions:** If you're being treated for a non-neurological condition, such as a skin issue or a digestive problem, your epilepsy history might not be directly relevant to your care.\n\n**When to disclose your history:**\n\n1. **Neurological or surgical procedures:** If you're undergoing any neurological or surgical procedures, it's essential to disclose your history, as it may impact the type of anesthesia or medications used.\n2. **Medication changes:** If you're starting new medications or changing your medication regimen, inform your healthcare provider about your epilepsy history, as some medications can lower the seizure threshold.\n3. **High-risk activities:** If you're engaging in high-risk activities, such as contact sports or activities that involve heights, it's essential to inform your healthcare provider and ensure you're taking necessary precautions.\n\n**How to approach medical questionnaires:**\n\n1. **Be honest:** Always disclose your history of epilepsy, even if you haven't had a seizure in years.\n2. **Provide context:** When filling out forms, include a brief explanation of your history, including the fact that you've been seizure-free since surgery.\n3. **Be prepared to discuss:** Be prepared to discuss your history with your healthcare provider, especially if they have questions or concerns.\n\nIn your case, since you've had a significant period of time without seizures and have had surgery to remove the underlying cause, your history might be less relevant for minor procedures or routine care. However, it's still essential to disclose your history and provide context to ensure your healthcare providers have a complete picture of your medical history.\n\nIf you're unsure about the relevance of your history in a specific situation, you can always ask your healthcare provider for guidance. They can help you determine whether your epilepsy history is relevant to your current care and make informed decisions about your treatment."

        "answer": "I can provide some general insights and possible explanations for your symptoms. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized advice.\r\n\r\nThe two distinct issues you're experiencing, zigzag flashes followed by a mild headache and the sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or dream recall with anxiety, could be related to several conditions. I'll outline some possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. **Migraines with aura**: Your visual symptoms, such as zigzag flashes (also known as fortification spectra), are consistent with a migraine aura. Migraines can also cause mild headaches, although they can be more severe in some cases. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or dream recall sensations could be a separate issue or a manifestation of the migraine aura.\r\n2. **Epilepsy**: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and zigzag flashes can be symptoms of certain types of epilepsy, such as temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the fact that your episodes are infrequent and not accompanied by other typical seizure symptoms (e.g., loss of consciousness, convulsions) makes this less likely.\r\n3. **Other possibilities**: Other conditions, like occipital lobe seizures, photic epilepsy, or even psychological factors (e.g., stress, anxiety), could contribute to your symptoms.\r\n\r\nTo better understand your situation, consider the following:\r\n\r\n* **Keep a symptom journal**: Track the frequency, duration, and any potential triggers for your episodes. This will help you identify patterns and provide valuable information for your doctor.\r\n* **Consult a neurologist**: A neurologist specializing in headaches or epilepsy can evaluate your symptoms and perform diagnostic tests (e.g., EEG, MRI) to rule out underlying conditions.\r\n* **Discuss your mental health**: Anxiety and stress can contribute to your symptoms. A mental health professional can help you address any underlying concerns and develop coping strategies.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, here are some general recommendations:\r\n\r\n* **Maintain a healthy lifestyle**: Regular exercise, balanced diet, and adequate sleep can help reduce stress and potentially alleviate symptoms.\r\n* **Manage stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.\r\n* **Avoid triggers**: If you identify any specific triggers (e.g., certain foods, lights, or sounds), try to avoid them.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized advice.

He is pretty healthy otherwise and always has been including weight per age and hitting correct milestones etc. He is also not on any medication.One part which he does every single day , countless times, to the point it\u2019s a normal occurrence now, is the smaller and less serious part i guess. It\u2019s hard to explain without a visual or without the correct terminology which i don\u2019t have/know of, but essentially what happens is he will get tense, making very expressive facial expressions mostly around his mouth (sometimes like an exaggerated smile with his eyes squeezed, or sometimes a face that could be described as looking \u2018 in pain\u2019) but his whole body will be kind of vibrating, hard enough that if he is doing it on a bed or couch i can feel the surface shaking.Sometimes he can be easily snapped out of these , other times it takes a couple of times saying his name, and he rarely ever realises he\u2019s doing it, and used to be confused if i tapped him to snap him out of it wondering what I was tapping him for. These don\u2019t seem to have a particular \u2018trigger\u2019 so to speak, but a common theme seems to be if he\u2019s watching something intense such as a fight scene in a film or watching something he is really into such as his favourite sport where he does these \u2018spasms\u2019 for a more prolonged period or intensity. He also does it for other mundane things such as after he has finished a task he will stand back and kind of hold his hands together and squeeze and make these \u2018faces\u2019.

That being said, rescue medication like Ativan (lorazepam) is typically used in emergency situations to stop or reduce the severity of seizures. It's not usually taken as a replacement for your regular medication like Keppra (levetiracetam) on a scheduled basis. Ativan has a different mechanism of action and is used for different purposes than Keppra. Taking Ativan every 12 hours without medical supervision could potentially lead to side effects or interactions. Reach out to your healthcare provider for guidance on how to manage your seizures until you can get a new prescription for Keppra. If you're unable to reach your regular doctor, consider visiting an urgent care center or emergency room for immediate assistance."

        "question": "25MI don't get it. I'm awake and alert in the middle of the day. and everything's fine. I wake up early and my brain says, \"screw you, here's a seizure. Have fun.\"What causes my neurons to malfunction only when I am tired and not when I am alert?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's not uncommon for seizures to occur when you're tired or during transitions between sleep and wakefulness. Several factors might contribute to this phenomenon. Keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and it's essential to consult with a neurologist or a healthcare professional for personalized advice. That being said, here are some possible explanations:\n\n1. **Sleep-wake cycle and neurotransmitters**: During the sleep-wake cycle, various neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine fluctuate. These chemicals play a role in regulating the excitability of neurons. When you're tired, the balance of these neurotransmitters might shift, making your brain more prone to abnormal electrical activity.\n2. **Circadian rhythm**: Your body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, influences the timing of various physiological processes, including the release of hormones and the activity of neurons. Some research suggests that seizures can be more likely to occur during certain times of the day, possibly due to the natural fluctuations in the body's circadian rhythm.\n3. **Neurotransmitter fatigue**: When you're awake and alert, your neurons are actively firing and communicating with each other. As you become tired, the efficiency of neural transmission might decrease, leading to a buildup of neurotransmitters like glutamate, which can excitate neurons and increase the likelihood of a seizure.\n4. **Decreased inhibitory control**: When you're tired, the brain's inhibitory systems, which help regulate and calm down neural activity, might be less effective. This can lead to an increase in excitatory activity, making it more likely for a seizure to occur.\n5. **Sleep pressure**: The longer you're awake, the more \"sleep pressure\" builds up. This pressure can affect the brain's electrical activity, making it more prone to seizures.\n6. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, such as the release of cortisol and adrenaline, can occur during times of fatigue. These hormonal changes might contribute to an increased risk of seizures.\n7. **Brain's \"default mode network\"**: Research suggests that the brain's default mode network (DMN), which is active during rest and deactive during goal-directed tasks, might play a role in seizure susceptibility. When you're tired, the DMN might be more active, potentially contributing to an increased risk of seizures.\n\nIt's essential to remember that seizures are complex and multifactorial, and the exact causes of your seizures may be unique to you. Consult with your neurologist to discuss your specific situation and develop strategies to manage your seizures.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips that might help:\n\n* Establish a consistent sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.\n* Practice stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n* Avoid triggers that might contribute to fatigue, such as caffeine, nicotine, or excessive screen time before bed.\n* Consider keeping a seizure diary to track your seizures and identify potential patterns or triggers.\n\nRemember, managing seizures often requires a comprehensive approach that involves lifestyle modifications, medication, and regular monitoring. Work closely with your healthcare team to find the best strategies for your specific situation."

        "question": "31F, Caucasian, hx of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, CPTSD and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy.Last summer, I went in for a simple o/p procedure that was just supposed to be under mild sedation. I brought specific directions from my neurologist for medication protocols. However, I was met with a combative and rude anesthesiologist that decided he knew better, changed my plan, and ultimately induced me with propofol which was both stated and written to have caused me seizures in the past.I am missing a window of time for nearly 3 hours where I apparently had a cluster of seizures in the recovery ward. Eventually, they decided to contact my neurologist as well as my partner, both of which stated I needed to be given lorazepam to stop the seizures. They were getting ready to transport me via ambulance to the ER when I came around, absolutely freaked out and somewhat incoherent. My partner arrived as quickly as he could and all I said is I wanted to go home, so they allowed me to sign myself out and he took me home, not being told outright how bad things really went. I ultimately was able to request my records and went on to report the anesthesiologist.Ever since then, I haven\u2019t been the same. My neurologists office has been indifferent to my situation. I\u2019ve suffered complete changes to my mental health and personality, as well as bizarre sleep disturbances. I\u2019m either in a constant state of panic, exhausted from the state of panic, or aggressive and moody. I wake up almost every night between 3-3:30am completely alert and ended up wandering around or on my phone for 1-2 hours until I pass back out. I was also having some breakthrough seizures in my sleep.Current meds: escitalopram 15mg q24 (recent increase) lacosamide 200mg q12 gabapentin 400mg q8-12 buspirone 5mg q12 (new) tizanidine 2-4mg before bed celecoxib 100mg q12-24 Vyvanse 30mg as needed (which I did quit for a while to see if it was the culprit. No change)Failed meds: temazepam venlafaxine lorazepam apriprazoleI just want my life back. I\u2019m under the care of a new mental health facility because I felt like the last one wasn\u2019t taking me seriously. Going to work or school is nearly impossible and I cry several times per day along with multiple panic attacks. We\u2019ve considered an IOP or inpatient hospitalization if this isn\u2019t under control soon.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about the traumatic experience you had during the procedure and the subsequent changes in your mental health and well-being. It's unacceptable that the anesthesiologist disregarded your neurologist's instructions and used a medication that had previously caused you seizures.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing, such as panic, exhaustion, aggression, and mood swings, are consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which you've already been diagnosed with. The additional stress and trauma from the procedure may have exacerbated your symptoms.\n\nThe sleep disturbances you're experiencing, particularly waking up between 3-3:30 am, are also common in individuals with PTSD and CPTSD. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"hypervigilance\" or \"Conditioned Hyperarousal.\" It's as if your body is \"on high alert\" and expects danger or trauma to occur, making it difficult to relax and fall asleep or stay asleep.\n\nGiven your complex medical history, it's essential to work with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including a neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist, to address your physical and emotional needs.\n\nConsider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Request a comprehensive re-evaluation** of your medication regimen with your new mental health team. They may need to adjust your medications or add new ones to better manage your symptoms.\n2. **Trauma-focused therapy** may be beneficial in addressing the underlying trauma and PTSD symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy may be helpful.\n3. **Sleep hygiene practices** can help improve your sleep quality. Establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and create a relaxing sleep environment.\n4. **Consider a sleep study** to rule out any underlying sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, which may be contributing to your sleep disturbances.\n5. **Advocate for yourself** and ensure that your healthcare team understands the severity of your symptoms and the impact they're having on your daily life.\n6. **Support groups** may be helpful in connecting with others who have experienced similar trauma and struggles. Sharing your experiences and hearing the stories of others can be a powerful way to heal and find support.\n7. **Keep a symptom journal** to track your symptoms, including the time of day, intensity, and any potential triggers. This can help you and your healthcare team identify patterns and develop more effective treatment strategies.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being. Don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team or a crisis helpline if you're experiencing overwhelming distress or suicidal thoughts.\n\nKeep in mind that healing from trauma and PTSD takes time, patience, and support. It's possible to regain control over your life and find a sense of peace and well-being. You deserve to have your life back, and with the right treatment and support, you can work towards achieving that goal."

        "answer": "I'll do my best to provide a helpful response. \n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's great you're proactive about your health and have been tracking your symptoms. That being said, I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult a doctor for personalized advice and diagnosis.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems you're experiencing two distinct sets of symptoms:\n\n1. **Heart rate fluctuations and orthostatic intolerance**: Your Apple Watch data shows a significant difference between your resting and standing heart rates. You've also experienced dizziness, vision fading, and spots when standing up. These symptoms could be related to orthostatic intolerance or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), as you've mentioned. However, since you haven't experienced fainting or sweating, it might be a different condition or a milder form of POTS.\n2. **\"Blackouts\" or episodes of loss of consciousness**: These episodes, which you've experienced since childhood, seem to be characterized by a sudden onset of nausea, muffled hearing, ringing in the ears, and tunnel vision, followed by a complete loss of consciousness. You've researched and considered transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and epilepsy as possible explanations. Given your family history of strokes, it's essential to explore this possibility further.\n\nConsidering your symptoms together, it's possible that:\n\n* They might be unrelated, and you're experiencing two separate conditions.\n* They could be related, and one condition is contributing to the other (e.g., orthostatic intolerance might trigger or exacerbate the \"blackouts\").\n* There might be an underlying condition that's causing both sets of symptoms, such as an autonomic nervous system disorder, a cardiac condition, or a neurological disorder.\n\nThe additional symptoms you mentioned, such as heat sensitivity and excessive sweating, could be related to your autonomic nervous system or hormonal imbalances.\n\nTo better understand your symptoms, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, or cognitive difficulties, that might be related to these episodes?\n2. Can you estimate how often these \"blackouts\" occur, and have you noticed any triggers or patterns?\n3. Have you consulted a doctor or a specialist (e.g., cardiologist, neurologist) about these symptoms, and if so, what was their assessment?\n4. Are there any other medical conditions or medications that might be contributing to these symptoms?\n\nPlease feel free to provide more information or clarify any of these points. I'll do my best to help you explore possible explanations and encourage you to consult a medical professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis."

I hyperventilated for some reason and stood up, passed out and woke up. I had a little dream when I passed out. My friend who was with me said I was swinging my right leg and scraping the carpet with my right hand for about 10 seconds. I remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for about 2 seconds. I'm feeling a little foggy. It happened a few hours ago. Was it an epileptic seizure or something else?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might have happened. Please note that this is not a substitute for a professional medical evaluation.\n\nYour symptoms, including hyperventilation, passing out (syncope), and a brief period of uncontrolled movements (swinging leg and scraping hand), could be indicative of several possible conditions. Given your family history of epilepsy, it's natural to consider the possibility of a seizure. However, there are other conditions that could also explain your symptoms.\n\nHere are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common cause of fainting or passing out, often triggered by stress, pain, or emotional distress. It can be accompanied by brief, involuntary movements. Vasovagal syncope is usually not related to epilepsy.\n2. **Hyperventilation-induced syncope**: Rapid breathing can lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting.\n3. **Seizure**: While it's possible that you experienced a seizure, the fact that you had a brief dream and remember scratching the carpet unintentionally for 2 seconds suggests that you may have had some level of awareness or consciousness during the episode. Seizures often involve a loss of consciousness and amnesia for the event.\n4. **Other conditions**: Other potential causes of your symptoms could include anxiety or panic attacks, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up), or even a transient ischemic attack (TIA or \"mini-stroke\").\n\nIt's essential to consult a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They will likely:\n\n* Take a thorough medical history, including your family history of epilepsy\n* Perform a physical examination\n* Ask questions about the episode, including any potential triggers or preceding symptoms\n* Possibly order tests, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), to assess your brain activity\n\nIn the meantime, if you experience any further episodes or concerning symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nPlease consult a doctor or visit an urgent care center to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action."

Then stopped - and my late granduncle was the top pediatric neurologist in the country - and did EEGs yearly until about 25.Had deja-vus up until college, never thought they could be considered related to epilepsy.When I was 45, epidemic, worst job in the world. Colleagues were in Rio, London, Lagos and Dubai. My sleep pattern went haywire, and I turned to Zolpidem to give me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Started at 5mg. As pressure grew, isolation, trouble in the job, slowly I grew the dosage. Had a burnout, left the job, and now I was taking 500mg to 600mg a day. Yes, 2 to 3 boxes. A day. I was floating in mid-air, barely ever lucid.Then I started having tonic-clonics. 8 in few months. I was deeply scared and built a team of therapist, psychologist and neurologist. Good news, nothing physical in the brain. Other good news is that I quit Zolpidem cold turkey, had withdrawal, suffered a lot... But quit.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you've been through a highly challenging period in your life, particularly with the significant increase in Zolpidem dosage which led to serious side effects, including tonic-clonic seizures. Quitting Zolpidem cold turkey, despite the withdrawal symptoms, is a considerable achievement. Given your history and the circumstances you've described, it's essential to understand the implications of your experiences and the steps you might consider moving forward.\n\n1. **History of Gardenal Use**: Gardenal (also known as Phenobarbital) is a barbiturate used for its sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties. Your early use of this medication, especially under the guidance of a pediatric neurologist and with regular EEG monitoring, suggests that there may have been concerns about seizure activity or a predisposition towards seizures from a young age.\n\n2. **Deja-Vus**: These can be a symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy or other neurological conditions. The fact that you experienced deja-vus until college could indicate a possible underlying condition that was either undiagnosed or not fully addressed.\n\n3. **Zolpidem Abuse and Seizures**: Zolpidem, an alternative to barbiturates for sleep, can lead to dependence and, in high doses, can cause seizures, especially in the context of withdrawal. Your experience of taking significantly higher than recommended doses and subsequently developing tonic-clonic seizures aligns with known risks associated with Zolpidem misuse.\n\n4. **Cold Turkey Withdrawal**: Stopping Zolpidem abruptly, despite the intense withdrawal symptoms, was a brave step towards recovery. However, it's crucial to follow up with medical professionals to ensure that any underlying conditions are being managed properly.\n\n5. **Current Situation and Next Steps**: \n   - **Neurological Evaluation**: Given your history of seizures and previous treatment with anticonvulsants, it's essential to continue monitoring your neurological health. Regular check-ups with your neurologist can help in assessing any potential for future seizures and managing any underlying conditions.\n   - **Psychological Support**: The psychological impact of your experiences, including burnout, isolation, and the trauma of seizures, should not be underestimated. Continuing therapy and psychological support can be beneficial in coping with these challenges.\n   - **Sleep Management**: Finding healthy alternatives to manage sleep is crucial. This might involve sleep hygiene practices, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), or other non-pharmacological approaches under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n   - **Lifestyle Changes**: Implementing stress management techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or exercise, can help in reducing overall stress levels and potentially mitigating the risk of future seizures or sleep disturbances.\n\nYour journey towards recovery and health is commendable, and it's clear that you've taken significant steps towards addressing your physical and psychological well-being. Continuing to work closely with your healthcare team will be essential in navigating any future challenges and ensuring that you're receiving the support you need."

The paramedics' initial assessment might have been correct that the seizure could be related to the combination of substances you consumed, but it's essential to investigate further to determine the cause.\r\n\r\nRegarding your current symptoms of extreme fatigue, weakness, and sluggishness, it's not uncommon to experience these after a seizure, especially if it was your first one. Fatigue can be a residual effect of the seizure itself, and it may take some time for your body to recover. Additionally, the stress and anxiety of experiencing a seizure can also contribute to feelings of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's also possible that your fatigue could be related to an underlying condition that may have contributed to the seizure. Some potential causes of seizures, such as infections, metabolic disorders, or neurological conditions, can also cause fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you experienced extreme nausea about a month ago, which seemed to resolve, might be unrelated to the seizure, but it's essential to discuss this with your doctor. It's possible that there's an underlying condition that's causing both the nausea and the seizure, or that the nausea was a warning sign of an impending seizure.\r\n\r\nTo better understand your situation, I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have you experienced any other symptoms besides fatigue, weakness, and sluggishness since the seizure? (e.g., headaches, dizziness, mood changes)\r\n2.

However, please consult a medical professional, such as a neurologist, for an accurate diagnosis and guidance.\r\n\r\nThat being said, your symptoms are quite complex and diverse, making it challenging to pinpoint a single cause. I'll try to break down some of the possible connections and considerations:\r\n\r\n1. **Sensitivity to light, panic, and breathing difficulties**: These symptoms could be related to anxiety, panic attacks, or even migraines. However, you've mentioned that you have anxiety and panic attacks, and these episodes feel different.\r\n2. **Tinnitus, eye sensitivity, and floaters**: These symptoms could be related to migraines, eye strain, or even neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis.\r\n3. **Short-term memory issues, reading difficulties, and muscle twitches**: These symptoms could be related to neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or even side effects of medications.\r\n4. **The \"shaking in a box\" sensation**: This is a unique and intriguing symptom. It's possible that it's related to a neurological condition, such as epilepsy, or a vestibular (balance-related) issue.\r\n5. **Trazodone**: While trazodone is not typically associated with seizure-like activity, it can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and increased risk of serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition). It's possible that trazodone might be exacerbating or revealing an underlying condition.\r\n\r\nRegarding focal seizures or epilepsy, it's possible that you might be experiencing some seizure-like activity, but it's essential to consult a neurologist to determine if this is the case. Focal seizures can manifest in various ways, including:\r\n\r\n* Simple partial seizures: localized symptoms, such as muscle twitches, numbness, or tingling, without loss of consciousness\r\n* Complex partial seizures: altered consciousness, confusion, or disorientation, often with automatism (repetitive behaviors)\r\n\r\nTo better understand your symptoms, a neurologist may recommend the following:\r\n\r\n* EEG (electroencephalogram) to measure brain activity\r\n* Imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scan) to rule out structural abnormalities\r\n* Blood tests to check for underlying conditions, such as electrolyte imbalances or infections\r\n* A thorough medical history and physical examination\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, consider the following:\r\n\r\n* Keep a symptom journal to track the frequency, duration, and potential triggers of your episodes\r\n* Discuss your concerns with your primary care physician or a neurologist\r\n* Be open with your healthcare provider about your medication regimen, including the trazodone, and any potential interactions or side effects\r\n\r\nRemember, it's essential to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and guidance.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "A very detailed and specific question!\n\nWhen a neurologist describes an EEG as \"essentially normal,\" it's often a nuanced way of conveying that the results don't show any obvious, clear-cut abnormalities, but there might be some subtle or borderline findings that don't quite fit into a normal range. This phrase can be used in a variety of situations, but here are some possible reasons why your neurologist might have chosen to use it:\n\n1. **Minor, non-specific findings**: The EEG might have shown some minor, non-specific changes, such as brief, subtle slowing or some scattered, low-amplitude discharges, which don't clearly indicate epilepsy or any other specific condition. These findings might not be significant enough to warrant a definitive diagnosis, but they're not entirely normal either.\n2. **Borderline or equivocal results**: The EEG might have shown some patterns or features that are borderline or equivocal, making it difficult for the neurologist to definitively classify them as normal or abnormal. For example, there might be some brief, isolated spikes or sharp waves that could be seen in both normal individuals and those with epilepsy.\n3. **Technical or artifact-related limitations**: The EEG recording might have been affected by technical issues, such as muscle artifacts, electrode placement, or other external interference, which could lead to some minor, non-specific changes that don't reflect the underlying brain activity.\n4. **Clinical context and correlation**: The neurologist might be taking into account your clinical history, symptoms, and the fact that you've had some response to Levetiracetam, which could suggest that the EEG findings, although \"essentially normal,\" might still be relevant to your condition. This might lead them to describe the EEG as \"essentially normal\" rather than simply \"normal,\" as they're considering the broader clinical context.\n5. **Hinting at a more complex diagnosis**: The use of \"essentially normal\" might also be a way for the neurologist to convey that the diagnosis is more complex or nuanced than a simple \"normal\" or \"abnormal\" EEG result. This could be because your condition, with a combination of autism, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and presumed epilepsy, might not fit neatly into a standard diagnostic category.\n\nIt's essential to note that \"essentially normal\" is not a formal or standardized term in EEG reporting. The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) provides guidelines for EEG interpretation, but the term \"essentially normal\" is not defined or recommended.\n\nGiven the complexity of your case, it's possible that the neurologist is being cautious and acknowledging that there might be some underlying, not fully understood, or not easily detectable abnormalities. To better understand the neurologist's reasoning, you may want to ask them to elaborate on what they mean by \"essentially normal\" and how it relates to your specific situation.\n\nYou may also want to ask questions like:\n\n* Can you provide more details about the EEG findings?\n* What specific aspects of the EEG were considered \"essentially normal\"?\n* How does this relate to my symptoms and clinical presentation?\n* What are the implications of this description for my diagnosis and treatment?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll be able to gain a deeper understanding of the neurologist's thought process and how the EEG results fit into your overall diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "question": "I want to donate plasma, partially because I have O negative blood and would be available every 4 weeks to donate. And partially because I discovered donating plasma also has health benefits for the donors such as reducing micro-plastics in the body.From what I can see online in the UK if you\u2019re epileptic you can\u2019t donate plasma/blood. I was wondering if anyone knew the reason for this? Is it because the medication I take could cause issues if it was in the blood?Or is it more of a \u2018we\u2019re worried you may have a seizure while donating\u2019 kind of risk where a doctors note might mitigate risks?If it\u2019s the latter, it seems a shame that something which could have a positive impact for both parties isn\u2019t allowed so I just wanted some insight into the matter as I can\u2019t see anything online which actually talks about the reasons behind the restriction.Female, 27, Epileptic, medication: Keppra and Eslicarbazepine, other than being epileptic I am healthy in all other respects (BMI: 20, non-smoker, non-drinker)",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The reason for the restriction on individuals with epilepsy donating plasma or blood in the UK is multifaceted, and I'll try to break it down for you.\n\nThe primary concerns are:\n\n1. **Medication**: As you mentioned, the medication you're taking, such as Keppra (levetiracetam) and Eslicarbazepine, could potentially be present in your plasma and affect the recipient. Although the amounts might be small, the risk of transmitting these medications to the recipient cannot be entirely ruled out. The plasma donation process involves pooling donations from multiple individuals, which increases the risk of medication accumulation.\n2. **Seizure risk**: The possibility of a seizure occurring during the donation process is a concern. Plasma donation can be a lengthy process, and the stress, fatigue, or other factors associated with the procedure might trigger a seizure in someone with epilepsy. This risk is difficult to mitigate, even with a doctor's note, as seizures can be unpredictable.\n3. **Underlying health condition**: Epilepsy is considered a chronic medical condition that may require ongoing management and monitoring. The UK's blood and plasma donation guidelines aim to ensure the safety of both donors and recipients. By excluding individuals with epilepsy, the guidelines aim to minimize the risk of transmitting potential complications or undiagnosed conditions associated with epilepsy.\n4. **Regulatory and liability considerations**: Blood and plasma donation centers, as well as regulatory bodies like the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the National Health Service (NHS), must adhere to stringent safety protocols. Excluding individuals with epilepsy helps minimize potential risks and liabilities associated with adverse reactions or complications.\n\nWhile a doctor's note might provide some reassurance, it's unlikely to completely mitigate the risks associated with epilepsy and plasma donation. The current guidelines are in place to prioritize the safety of both donors and recipients.\n\nRegarding the health benefits of donating plasma, such as reducing microplastics in the body, it's essential to note that these claims are not universally accepted and require further research to fully understand the relationship between plasma donation and microplastic reduction.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring alternative ways to contribute, you may consider:\n\n1. **Organ donation**: You can register to become an organ donor, which can help save lives in the event of your passing.\n2. **Bone marrow donation**: You can register with a bone marrow registry, such as the Anthony Nolan Trust, to help patients in need of a bone marrow transplant.\n3. **Volunteering**: Many organizations, such as charities or community groups, rely on volunteers to support their causes.\n4. **Blood component donation**: While you may not be eligible for plasma donation, you might be able to donate other blood components, such as red blood cells or platelets, depending on your specific medical condition and the guidelines in place.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your options with your healthcare provider and explore alternative ways to contribute to the community while ensuring your safety and the safety of others."

        "question": "My friend is 19 and pregnant. She\u2019s in her 11th week of pregnancy and started experiencing \u201cseizures\u201d while sleeping and then also while awake. so she admitted to the hospital but the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. She doesn\u2019t have any history of epilepsy or seizures even in her family. she did experience sepsis about a couple months ago while she was pregnant with her last baby (she had to abort it). This time around apparently just her magnesium levels were low in the blood tests and her oxygen saturation levels were around 93% when she would start getting dizzy and about to experience a \u201cseizure\u201d. I say \u201cseizure\u201d because apparently the docs at the hospital didn\u2019t think they were proper seizures and ive never seen one of hers so idk either but she would experience amnesia after them, be very confused and dazed. She also wouldn\u2019t experience any pain during the seizures but would afterwards when she came out of them. I\u2019m only really looking for advice.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're seeking advice and support for your friend. Given the complex and concerning symptoms she's experiencing, it's essential to approach this situation with caution and care. Since your friend is pregnant and has a history of sepsis, it's crucial to consider potential underlying conditions that might be contributing to her symptoms.\n\n**Key concerns:**\n\n1. **Unexplained \"seizures\"**: The fact that doctors didn't witness typical seizure activity and are unsure about the cause raises questions. It's possible that your friend might be experiencing a different type of episode, such as:\n\t* Non-epileptic seizures (also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or PNES)\n\t* Vasovagal syncope (a type of fainting spell)\n\t* Other conditions like hypoglycemia or electrolyte imbalances\n2. **Low magnesium levels**: Magnesium deficiency can contribute to muscle cramps, weakness, and other symptoms. However, it's unclear if this is the sole cause of her \"seizures.\"\n3. **Oxygen saturation levels**: A level of 93% is slightly below the normal range (95-100%). This could be related to her symptoms, especially if she's experiencing respiratory issues or other underlying conditions.\n4. **Sepsis history**: While it's been a couple of months since her last sepsis episode, it's possible that there might be some lingering effects or increased susceptibility to infections.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion**: Encourage your friend to consult with a high-risk obstetrician or a neurologist who can provide a more specialized assessment and guidance.\n2. **Comprehensive diagnostic workup**: Suggest that her medical team perform a thorough evaluation, including:\n\t* Electroencephalogram (EEG) to rule out epilepsy or other seizure disorders\n\t* Blood tests to check for electrolyte imbalances, anemia, or other potential causes\n\t* Imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scans) to rule out any underlying structural issues\n\t* Sleep studies to evaluate potential sleep disorders\n3. **Monitor and manage magnesium levels**: Ensure that her magnesium levels are closely monitored and supplemented if necessary to prevent further deficiencies.\n4. **Oxygen therapy**: If her oxygen saturation levels are consistently low, oxygen therapy might be beneficial to help alleviate symptoms.\n5. **Emotional support**: As a friend, offer emotional support and encouragement. It's essential to help her cope with the stress and uncertainty surrounding her condition.\n6. **Prenatal care**: Emphasize the importance of regular prenatal check-ups to monitor her pregnancy and address any concerns that may arise.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* It's crucial to approach this situation with caution and prioritize your friend's health and well-being.\n* Encourage her to ask questions and seek clarification from her medical team regarding her symptoms and treatment plan.\n* As a friend, you can offer emotional support and help her navigate the healthcare system, but ultimately, it's essential to rely on medical professionals for guidance and care.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."

        "question": "22F, 110 poundsCurrent Medications- Lamictal 200 mg in the AM & PM so 400mg total a day. Vyvanse 40mg once a day, don't take on the weekends unless I am scheduled to work.I smoke medical marijuana and HARDLY drink, probably 3 times year.Background- So I need to say now that when I was explained all of this I was 16 so it is very dumbed down and I still do not fully understand it lol. But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures.So my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll try to help you understand your situation better.\n\n**Dextromethorphan toxicity and its aftermath**\n\nIt's astonishing that you survived the overdose and subsequent psychosis. Dextromethorphan, a common ingredient in cough and cold medicines, can cause severe symptoms, including hallucinations, seizures, and coma, when taken in excessive amounts. The prolonged period of intubation and psychosis you experienced was likely a result of the toxicity and the subsequent brain injury.\n\n**Epilepsy and seizures**\n\nYour neurologist diagnosed you with epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Grand Mal seizures, also known as tonic-clonic seizures, are a type of seizure that affects the entire brain and can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness, and muscle contractions.\n\nThe lesion in your brain, which was initially thought to be the cause of your seizures, may be a result of the brain injury sustained during the overdose. The secretions firing off from the lesion can indeed trigger seizures.\n\n**Lesion size and seizures**\n\nThe decrease in lesion size, as reported by your neurologist, could be due to several factors:\n\n1. **Scar tissue formation**: Over time, the damaged brain tissue may have formed scar tissue, which could reduce the size of the lesion.\n2. **Resolution of inflammation**: The initial injury may have caused inflammation, which has since subsided, reducing the lesion size.\n3. **Changes in imaging techniques**: The newer MRI technology or differences in imaging protocols might have resulted in a more accurate measurement of the lesion size.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the lesion size may not directly correlate with the frequency or severity of your seizures. The seizures may persist even if the lesion appears smaller, as the underlying brain injury and abnormal electrical activity can still be present.\n\n**Medication and seizure control**\n\nYour current medication regimen, including Lamictal (lamotrigine) and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine), is likely helping to control your seizures. Lamictal is an anticonvulsant medication that can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. Vyvanse, a stimulant medication, may also have some benefits in reducing seizure frequency, although this is not its primary indication.\n\n**Prognosis and potential for seizure cessation**\n\nWhile it's possible that your lesion may be shrinking, it's difficult to predict whether your seizures will stop entirely. Factors that influence seizure cessation include:\n\n1. **Medication adherence**: Continuing to take your medications as prescribed is crucial in controlling seizures.\n2. **Underlying brain injury**: The extent of the initial brain injury and any ongoing abnormal electrical activity may affect the likelihood of seizure cessation.\n3. **Individual variability**: Each person's brain is unique, and the response to medication and treatment can vary.\n\nIt's essential to continue working with your neurologist to monitor your condition, adjust your medication regimen as needed, and explore other treatment options if your seizures persist or worsen.\n\n**Next steps**\n\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with your neurologist to discuss your concerns and questions. Ask about:\n\n1. **Further imaging studies**: Additional MRIs or other imaging tests to monitor the lesion size and brain activity.\n2. **Medication adjustments**: Potential changes to your medication regimen to optimize seizure control.\n3. **Seizure tracking**: Keeping a seizure diary to monitor the frequency, duration, and severity of your seizures.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to continue taking your medications as prescribed and attending follow-up appointments with your neurologist to ensure the best possible management of your condition."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing this distressing issue with taking your Epilim 500mg tablets. It's completely understandable that you're concerned and want to find a solution.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for taking proactive steps and planning to speak with your pharmacist and GP tomorrow. That's the best course of action, as they can provide personalized advice and guidance.\n\nRegarding your suggestion of taking 5 x 200mg pills instead of 2 x 500mg pills in the evening, it's worth discussing with your healthcare team. Since the 200mg pills are easier for you to swallow, it's possible that this could be a viable alternative. However, it's essential to consult with your pharmacist and GP to ensure that:\n\n1. The total daily dosage remains equivalent (1000mg in the evening).\n2. The bioavailability and efficacy of the medication are not affected by taking multiple smaller tablets instead of the larger ones.\n3. There are no potential interactions or concerns with taking more frequent, smaller doses.\n\nIn the meantime, to help alleviate the issue, you may want to try a few things:\n\n1. **Take the 500mg tablet with a thicker liquid**: Instead of water, try taking the tablet with a thicker liquid like yogurt, applesauce, or a smoothie. This might help the tablet pass more easily through your throat.\n2. **Use a pill swallowing cup**: A pill swallowing cup can help you take the tablet with a small amount of water, and the cup's design can aid in getting the pill to go down more smoothly.\n3. **Sit upright**: Make sure you're sitting upright when taking the tablet, and try to stay in that position for a few minutes after swallowing to help the pill move down your esophagus.\n4. **Breathe slowly and deeply**: Before swallowing, take a few slow, deep breaths to help relax your throat muscles, which may make it easier to swallow the tablet.\n\nRemember to discuss these suggestions with your pharmacist and GP, and follow their advice on the best course of action.\n\nLastly, please prioritize your comfort and safety when taking your medication. If you're experiencing persistent discomfort, pain, or bleeding, don't hesitate to seek medical attention.\n\nYou're taking the right steps by seeking help, and I'm confident that your healthcare team will work with you to find a solution that ensures you can take your medication safely and effectively."

The only question I did not get to ask him was if I have to continue only taking 1 a day since trokendi is an extended release or if I have to take 2 a day. Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "When switching from Trokendi XR (an extended-release formulation of topiramate) to a generic immediate-release topiramate, the dosing frequency may change due to the difference in formulation.\n\nTrokendi XR is designed to release the medication slowly over a 24-hour period, allowing for once-daily dosing. In contrast, immediate-release topiramate is released more quickly and typically needs to be taken multiple times a day to maintain a consistent level of the medication in the body.\n\nTo ensure you're taking the correct dose and frequency, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Contact your neurologist**: Reach out to your neurologist's office as soon as possible to clarify the dosing instructions for the generic topiramate. They can provide guidance on whether you should take one dose per day or split the dose into multiple times a day.\n2. **Check the prescription label**: When you pick up the new prescription, review the label carefully for dosing instructions. The label should indicate how many tablets or capsules to take and how often.\n3. **Consult with your pharmacist**: If you're still unsure, you can also ask your pharmacist to confirm the dosing instructions and provide guidance on how to take the medication.\n\nIt's essential to follow the correct dosing regimen to ensure you're getting the right amount of medication and to minimize any potential side effects.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and double-check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist to confirm the correct dosing instructions."

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're experiencing a complex mix of symptoms that can be challenging to manage. I'll try to break down some possible connections and suggestions, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with your neurologist, primary care physician, or a specialist for personalized advice.\n\n**Epilepsy and micro-seizures**: It's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to experience aura-like symptoms, such as the \"falling into the ground\" feelings you described. Micro-seizures can be subtle and may not always be detected by EEG or other diagnostic tests. Your neurologist may continue to monitor you for any changes or patterns in your symptoms.\n\n**Migraines and headaches**: Given your history of migraines, it's possible that the current prolonged migraine episode is related to hormonal changes (e.g., due to PCOS), stress, or other factors. The MRI and MRA scans may help identify any underlying structural issues, such as blood vessel abnormalities or other conditions that could be contributing to your headaches.\n\n**Depersonalization and anxiety**: It's common for people with anxiety, BPD, and other mental health conditions to experience depersonalization symptoms, including feelings of disconnection from their body or surroundings. This could be contributing to your \"not feeling right\" or \"odd feelings.\" Your therapist or counselor can help you explore coping strategies and techniques to manage these symptoms.\n\n**Medications**: You're taking a combination of medications for your various conditions. While these medications can be effective, they may also interact with each other or have side effects that could exacerbate your symptoms. For example, metformin (for PCOS) can sometimes cause dizziness or lightheadedness, which might be contributing to your vertigo-like symptoms. Topiramate (for epilepsy and migraines) can also cause dizziness, fatigue, or mood changes.\n\n**Lifestyle factors**: As you mentioned, you smoke occasionally, which can potentially worsen migraines and other symptoms. While you don't drink alcohol, it's essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques, to help mitigate your symptoms.\n\n**Questions and next steps**:\n\n1. Have you experienced any changes in your mood, appetite, or sleep patterns recently?\n2. Can you describe your migraine symptoms in more detail, including any patterns, triggers, or relieving factors?\n3. Have you discussed your concerns about depersonalization and anxiety with your therapist or counselor?\n4. Are you experiencing any side effects from your medications that you haven't mentioned?\n5. What are your expectations and concerns about the upcoming MRI and MRA scans?\n\nIn terms of similar experiences, there are several online forums and support groups for people with epilepsy, migraines, and BPD, where you may find others who share similar symptoms and challenges. Some resources include:\n\n* Epilepsy Foundation\n* Migraine Research Foundation\n* National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)\n* Borderline Personality Disorder Resource Center\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to address your complex symptoms and conditions. Keep a symptom journal to track your experiences, and don't hesitate to reach out to your doctors or therapists with any questions or concerns."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad to hear that you've been seizure-free for a significant period! The likelihood of your epilepsy returning depends on several factors, which I'll outline below.\n\n**Can epilepsy come back?**\nYes, it's possible for epilepsy to recur, even after a long period of being seizure-free. This is known as \"recurrent epilepsy\" or \"recurrence.\" The risk of recurrence varies from person to person and depends on several factors, which I'll discuss below.\n\n**Factors that may increase the risk of recurrence:**\n\n1. **Type of epilepsy**: If you had a specific type of epilepsy, such as infantile spasms or myoclonic epilepsy, the risk of recurrence may be higher.\n2. **Underlying brain abnormalities**: If you have an underlying brain condition, such as a structural abnormality or a genetic predisposition, the risk of recurrence may be higher.\n3. **Medication withdrawal**: Stopping medication abruptly or too quickly can increase the risk of recurrence. It's essential to work with your doctor to taper off medication gradually, if necessary.\n4. **Triggers**: Certain triggers, such as stress, sleep deprivation, fever, or hormonal changes, can increase the risk of recurrence.\n5. **Genetic predisposition**: If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be more likely to experience a recurrence.\n6. **Age**: Although you're 17 now, some types of epilepsy are more likely to recur during adolescence or early adulthood.\n\n**Common triggers that may cause seizures:**\n\n1. **Stress**: Emotional or physical stress can trigger seizures in some people.\n2. **Sleep deprivation**: Lack of sleep or disrupted sleep patterns can increase the risk of seizures.\n3. **Fever**: High fever, especially if it's sudden or severe, can trigger seizures.\n4. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during puberty, menstruation, or menopause may trigger seizures in some people.\n5. **Substance use**: Using certain substances, such as recreational drugs or excessive caffeine, can increase the risk of seizures.\n6. **Head trauma**: A head injury, even if minor, can trigger a seizure in some cases.\n7. **Infections**: Certain infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can increase the risk of seizures.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. **Regular check-ups**: Schedule regular appointments with your doctor to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n2. **Medication adherence**: If you're still taking medication, take it as prescribed, and don't stop or change your medication without consulting your doctor.\n3. **Seizure diary**: Keep a seizure diary to track any potential triggers or patterns.\n4. **Lifestyle modifications**: Maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular sleep patterns, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques, such as meditation or exercise.\n5. **Emergency preparedness**: Make sure you and your loved ones know what to do in case of a seizure, including how to provide first aid and when to seek medical attention.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your individual situation with your doctor, as they can provide personalized guidance and support. They may recommend ongoing monitoring, medication adjustments, or other strategies to minimize the risk of recurrence.\n\nRemember, while the risk of recurrence exists, many people with a history of epilepsy lead normal, healthy lives with proper management and care."

        "question": "According to my sister (her mother), my 5 year old niece was eating ice cream the other night at a restaurant when she got real still, said she had a headache, then her whole body fell and she slid under the table. My sister picked her up and my niece was totally stiff and not breathing, then her legs started convulsing. After about 20 seconds she woke up and exclaimed \u201cwhat was that\u201d and started crying. She was brought to urgent care but was fine by that point, and got an EEG this morning (about 3 days later) and everything appeared normal. My niece later described it as falling asleep without even trying. Apparently my niece has passed out twice before while eating ice cream (never a seizure), and also once when she was much littler when a kid ran into her hard. All the doctor said about this recent episode is it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.What could be causing this? Are there links between ice cream, sugar, or dairy and passing out/seizures? Could it be a pain response to brain freeze? To my knowledge there is no family history of seizures. My sister is really worried and I\u2019m just trying to help find answers.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're trying to help your sister find answers. The episode your niece experienced is indeed concerning, and I'll try to provide some insights.\n\n**Possible explanations:**\n\n1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common condition that can cause fainting, especially in children. It's often triggered by stress, pain, or sudden changes in body position. In your niece's case, the stress of eating ice cream, the cold temperature, or the sudden brain freeze might have triggered a vasovagal response, leading to fainting.\n2. **Reflex anoxic seizures**: These seizures are caused by a brief lack of oxygen to the brain, often triggered by a sudden, intense stimulus, such as pain or fright. The symptoms you described, including stiffness, loss of consciousness, and convulsing legs, are consistent with reflex anoxic seizures.\n3. **Cold stimulus headache**: Brain freeze, also known as cold stimulus headache, can be intense and might trigger a pain response that leads to fainting.\n\n**Links between ice cream, sugar, dairy, and passing out/seizures:**\n\n1. **Cold stress**: Eating cold foods like ice cream can cause blood vessels in the face and head to constrict, potentially leading to a brief decrease in blood flow to the brain, which might contribute to fainting.\n2. **Sugar rush**: Consuming high-sugar foods like ice cream can cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels, followed by a crash. This fluctuation might lead to symptoms like shakiness, dizziness, or even fainting in some individuals.\n3. **Dairy sensitivity**: Although less likely, some people may experience an allergic or intolerance reaction to dairy products, which could potentially trigger anaphylaxis or other symptoms, including fainting.\n\n**Other considerations:**\n\n1. **Breath-holding spells**: Children sometimes experience breath-holding spells, which can be triggered by pain, fear, or frustration. These spells can lead to fainting and convulsions.\n2. **Cardiac issues**: Although unlikely, it's essential to consider the possibility of underlying cardiac conditions, such as long QT syndrome, which can increase the risk of fainting and seizures.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Follow-up with the doctor**: Schedule a follow-up appointment with your niece's doctor to discuss the EEG results and the doctor's concerns.\n2. **Monitor and track episodes**: Keep a record of any future episodes, including the circumstances surrounding them, to help identify potential patterns or triggers.\n3. **Consider a cardiology evaluation**: Given the fainting episodes, it's a good idea to have your niece evaluated by a cardiologist to rule out any underlying cardiac conditions.\n4. **Neurology consultation**: If your niece's doctor suspects a seizure disorder or another neurological condition, a consultation with a pediatric neurologist may be helpful.\n\nReassure your sister that it's understandable to be worried, but with the help of medical professionals, you can work together to determine the cause of these episodes and develop a plan to ensure your niece's safety and well-being."

        "question": "I was a healthy, fit male in my early 40s when I started having episodes where I would get light headed and sometimes pass out after a work out in the weight room that included pull ups. Fyi, I was and still am(60yrs old now)taking PPIs for Gerd caused by a Hiatal hernia. My physician sent me to a neurologist who said I had Epilepsy and wanted to put me on meds. I explained it only happened after work outs, I refused the meds. I went to the Director on the Southern Epilepsy Foundation, he examined me and confirmed I did not have Epilepsy. He had me go through a barrage of heart tests, thinking I was experiencing Syncope. They reached no conclusive explanation. I have thought it could be something to do with the proximity of the Vagus nerve to the Hiatal hernia and the pressure of lifting weights causing a vertigo/fainting response or the lack of nutrient absorption due to PPI use that created the light headed/fainting episodes? My physician said to stop doing pull ups. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a few years now. I did stop the pull-ups which I miss and backed off the amount of weight I lift. Still on PPIs. Any thoughts? Thank you for any feed back.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What a fascinating case! I'm glad you're doing better now, and I'd be happy to offer some insights and potential explanations for your experiences.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you advocated for yourself and refused the epilepsy medication, as the episodes were indeed exercise-induced and not typical of epilepsy. The Director of the Southern Epilepsy Foundation's diagnosis and subsequent heart tests were a good step in ruling out other potential causes.\n\nConsidering your history of GERD, hiatal hernia, and PPI use, I think your hypotheses are plausible. Here are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **Vagus nerve stimulation**: As you mentioned, the vagus nerve runs close to the esophagus and stomach. The hiatal hernia could potentially put pressure on the vagus nerve, especially during heavy lifting or straining exercises like pull-ups. This pressure might stimulate the vagus nerve, leading to a vasovagal response, which can cause lightheadedness, dizziness, or even fainting (syncope).\n2. **Nutrient malabsorption**: Long-term PPI use can lead to impaired nutrient absorption, including vitamin B12, iron, and magnesium deficiencies. These deficiencies can contribute to fatigue, weakness, and lightheadedness, especially during intense physical activity. Although you're still taking PPIs, it's possible that your reduced exercise intensity and avoidance of pull-ups have mitigated these effects.\n3. **Gastroesophageal reflux and breathing patterns**: GERD and hiatal hernia can affect breathing patterns, particularly during exercise. For example, intense exercise can trigger gastroesophageal reflux, leading to coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This, in turn, might contribute to lightheadedness or dizziness.\n4. **Exercise-induced hypotension**: Some people experience a drop in blood pressure during or after exercise, which can lead to lightheadedness or fainting. This might be more pronounced in individuals with underlying conditions like GERD or hiatal hernia.\n\nIt's also possible that a combination of these factors contributed to your episodes.\n\nGiven your current situation, it's reassuring that you haven't had an episode in a few years. To further explore the underlying causes, you might consider discussing the following with your physician:\n\n* **PPI alternatives**: Explore alternative treatments for GERD, such as H2 blockers or lifestyle modifications (e.g., dietary changes, weight management, and stress reduction), which might help mitigate potential nutrient malabsorption issues.\n* **Vagus nerve evaluation**: Although the epilepsy foundation director didn't find any conclusive evidence, it might be worth discussing a vagus nerve evaluation or consultation with a gastroenterologist to investigate potential vagus nerve involvement.\n* **Exercise modifications**: If you miss doing pull-ups, you could try modifying your exercise routine to include alternative exercises that don't involve heavy lifting or straining, such as rowing or lat pulldowns.\n* **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regular check-ins with your physician to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before making any significant changes to your exercise routine, medication, or treatment plan.\n\nI hope this feedback helps you better understand your situation, and I wish you continued good health!"

I don\u2019t lose consciousness or memory or have any shaking or stuff like that. The episodes are over in around 20 minutes as the feeling fade away.I\u2019m really curious if the reason is pure anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) or maybe something else.What makes me think about it is the fact that the episodes are sudden and apparently not related to stress.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're reaching out to share your experience and seek more insight into what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to talk about unusual and potentially unsettling experiences like the ones you're describing.\n\nTo start, it's great that you're aware of your general anxiety disorder, and it's possible that anxiety could be a contributing factor to your episodes. However, the fact that the episodes seem to occur suddenly and aren't necessarily tied to stressful events is an interesting aspect to consider.\n\nDissociation and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can be symptoms of various conditions, including anxiety disorders, but they can also be related to other factors such as:\n\n1. **Temporal lobe seizures**: Some people experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a symptom of temporal lobe seizures, which can be a type of epilepsy. However, as you mentioned, you don't experience any loss of consciousness, memory, or shaking, which are common symptoms of seizures.\n2. **Migraines**: Some people experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dissociation as a precursor to a migraine headache. Have you noticed any other symptoms like headaches, sensitivity to light or sound, or visual disturbances around the time of your episodes?\n3. **Sleep disturbances**: Sleep disorders like sleep apnea, insomnia, or restless leg syndrome can sometimes cause dissociative symptoms, including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n4. **Neurological conditions**: Certain conditions like multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, or vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12 deficiency) can cause dissociative symptoms.\n5. **Trauma**: Past traumatic experiences can lead to dissociation and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a coping mechanism.\n\nSince you've been experiencing these episodes for 10 years, it's possible that there's an underlying pattern or trigger that you haven't yet identified. I'd like to ask a few more questions to help us explore this further:\n\n* Can you describe the sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dissociation in more detail? Is it a feeling of being disconnected from your surroundings, or more like a sense of familiarity?\n* Have you noticed any patterns or common themes around the time of your episodes, such as certain activities, emotions, or environments?\n* Have you talked to your doctor or a mental health professional about these episodes? If so, what have they suggested or ruled out?\n* Have you made any lifestyle changes or tried any relaxation techniques that seem to help alleviate or trigger the episodes?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little information as you're comfortable with, and we can work together to explore possible explanations and next steps."

        "question": "Female and Male, age 26 and 27. Female with epilepsy, male no medical diagnosis. Female on Keppra and Lamotrigine.My husband and I lived in a nice little basement suite for 3 years. Wishing a couple months of moving in, I developed epilepsy (unrelated head injury). Because of this I began taking medications. Not that long after I started to get morning sickness (without being pregnant). Every day for 2 years I woke up nauseous and vomited half of those times. It was believed it was my medication as epilepsy meds are pretty rough sometimes. About 6 months after moving in, my husband began waking up with nausea about 50% of the mornings. He has a high stress job and we believed it to be anxiety. In addition to that, we adopted our old cat about a year after moving in. He has a few medical issues and takes medication morning and night. He would vomit 5/7 mornings a week. The vet believed this to be part of his medical issues. All of that lined up until we moved 2 weeks ago. None of us have been sick since. As in, our last bouts of being sick was the day we woke up in our old place and moved. No nausea, no vomiting, not a dry heave in sight. If it was just one of us, it could be psychosomatic. I\u2019d even be willing to believe that if it was both humans. But why the cat too?If it wasn\u2019t the medication, anxiety and cat\u2019s diagnosis, what was happening in that house???TLDR: 2 adults and a cat experienced nausea and vomiting for years, stopped instantly the day we moved.EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers. It has made me very relieved that we left and we plan to take action. The house is for sale, which is why we moved, so we are going to inform the current owner, the real estate agent as well as the tenants who lived above us. We are also looking at our other options around ensuring this is properly taken care of so no one else gets hurt. I\u2019ll also follow up when it sells to ensure the new owner didn\u2019t get left with the fall out.Thank you all again!",

        "answer": "The mysterious case of the nausea-plagued household! I'll try to provide some insights and potential explanations.\n\nGiven that all three household members (two humans and a cat) experienced similar symptoms (nausea and vomiting) for an extended period, and that these symptoms ceased immediately after moving to a new location, it's likely that the cause was environmental. Here are some potential factors to consider:\n\n1. **Mold or water damage**: Basements can be prone to dampness, which can lead to mold growth. Mold spores can cause a range of health issues, including nausea, vomiting, and respiratory problems. If the basement suite had water damage or poor ventilation, this could be a possible culprit.\n2. **Indoor air pollution**: Basements can also accumulate pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), radon, and carbon monoxide. These substances can emanate from various sources, including building materials, appliances, and soil. Prolonged exposure to poor indoor air quality could have contributed to the nausea and vomiting.\n3. **Pesticide or chemical exposure**: If the previous owners or tenants used pesticides or chemicals in the basement, these substances could have lingered in the environment, causing health issues.\n4. **Carbon monoxide poisoning**: Although less likely, it's possible that a faulty appliance or heating system could have been leaking carbon monoxide, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and other health problems.\n5. **Electromagnetic fields (EMFs)**: Some research suggests that EMFs from sources like Wi-Fi routers, cell phones, or nearby power lines could contribute to health issues, including nausea and vomiting. However, the evidence is still limited and inconclusive.\n6. **Other environmental factors**: Other potential environmental factors could include poor ventilation, excessive moisture, or the presence of allergens like dust mites or pet dander.\n\nThe fact that the cat was also affected suggests that the cause was likely environmental, as cats are often more sensitive to their surroundings than humans.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're taking steps to inform the current owner, real estate agent, and tenants about the potential issue. This will help ensure that any necessary measures are taken to address the problem and prevent future health issues for others.\n\nIn terms of next steps, you may want to consider:\n\n* Requesting an inspection or testing of the basement suite to identify potential environmental hazards.\n* Notifying local health authorities or a environmental health department to report the incident.\n* Keeping a record of your experiences and any subsequent actions taken to address the issue.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm glad to hear that you're all feeling better in your new home!"

        "question": "22 M, 150 lb, 5'8\", white, myoclonus and \"brain zaps\" for the last two months. No history of seizures or epilepsy.Two months ago, while taking 10 mg fluoxetine daily, I decided to take some recreational substances. I can't undo this and am sober now so please don't give me too hard a time about this. I consumed 8 beers, 5 grams of kratom powder, and 50 mg of THC. The night before this, I had taken essentially the same combination minus the THC. I felt pretty much fine and fell asleep, maybe a little woozy from all the substances. However, I woke up early in the AM twitching. I didn't feel feverish or seriously unwell, so I didn't go to the doctor (I also don't have a GP right now).The twitching has persisted for the last two months. It's only when I'm sitting or lying down. It's gotten somewhat better over this time, but is worse when I'm tired or have coffee. I also experience the \"brain zaps\" seen in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. On a bad day, I'll twitch up to once a minute. Over the last two months, I also have seen a general shift away from twitching and toward \"brain zaps.\"I haven't gone into urgent care or set a new appointment with a GP (which would be in, like, 2024) because I read there's no real treatment for the SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, and the twitching doesn't really get in the way that much. But I sort of notice that whenever I twitch I lose focus, which is concerning.Does this sound like something that will continue to slowly go away, or have I given myself epilepsy? My one interpretation is that I probably had mild serotonin syndrome and that combined with abruptly stopping my the fluoxetine could cause my symptoms, and that it'll just go away sooner or later. On the other hand, maybe I had a really severe seizure while I was asleep and now I have given myself epilepsy. I don't know if you can tell, but I will feel really bad if I have permanently disabled myself with drugs, but I guess any way you slice it, these are mild, localized seizures, right?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to provide you with a balanced and neutral perspective on your situation.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that you're taking responsibility for your actions, and it's great that you've been sober since the incident. It's also good that you're seeking help and guidance, even if it's online.\n\nNow, let's break down your symptoms and possible causes:\n\n1. **Myoclonus and brain zaps**: These symptoms are consistent with SSRI discontinuation syndrome, which can occur when stopping or reducing the dose of an SSRI (like fluoxetine) too quickly. Brain zaps are a common symptom of this condition.\n2. **Twitching**: The twitching you're experiencing, particularly when sitting or lying down, could be related to the myoclonus. Myoclonus can be caused by various factors, including medication changes, sleep disorders, or even anxiety.\n3. **Recreational substance use**: The combination of substances you consumed, including kratom, THC, and alcohol, can increase the risk of adverse reactions, including seizures. However, it's essential to note that you didn't experience a seizure at the time, and you're not reporting any other seizure-like symptoms.\n\nRegarding your concerns about epilepsy:\n\n* **Epilepsy**: It's unlikely that you've given yourself epilepsy solely based on the substances you consumed and the symptoms you're experiencing. Epilepsy is a complex condition that typically requires a comprehensive evaluation, including EEGs, imaging studies, and a thorough medical history.\n* **Seizure risk**: While it's possible that you may have had a seizure during sleep, there's no concrete evidence to suggest this. If you were experiencing seizures, you would likely have other symptoms, such as aura, loss of consciousness, or post-ictal confusion.\n\nYour interpretation about mild serotonin syndrome and SSRI discontinuation syndrome is plausible. The combination of substances you consumed could have increased your risk of serotonin syndrome, which can cause myoclonus, twitching, and other symptoms. Stopping fluoxetine abruptly may have contributed to the brain zaps and myoclonus.\n\nAs for the likelihood of your symptoms resolving on their own:\n\n* **Prognosis**: It's possible that your symptoms will continue to improve over time, especially if you've been sober and haven't experienced any further substance-related incidents. However, it's essential to consult a medical professional to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n* **Treatment**: While there may not be a specific treatment for SSRI discontinuation brain zaps, a healthcare professional can help you manage your symptoms, explore alternative treatments, and provide guidance on tapering off fluoxetine safely if needed.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. **Schedule a doctor's appointment**: Try to get an appointment with a GP or a neurologist as soon as possible. They can evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and perform any necessary tests to rule out underlying conditions.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your symptoms, including when they occur, their severity, and any potential triggers. This will help your healthcare provider better understand your condition.\n3. **Be honest about your substance use**: When you see a doctor, be open about your substance use, including the incident that led to your current symptoms. This information is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to manage them. While it's possible that your symptoms will resolve on their own, it's always better to err on the side of caution and seek medical attention to ensure your health and well-being."

        "question": "I had a brain surgery 12 years ago to remove an AVM on the right side of my brain. A few years after the surgery, I was put back on epilepsy meds after I had a seizure. I've had seizures in clusters since then. That's the background, but my question isn't regarding epilepsy.My concern: I tried to get into weightlifting. However, every time I try to use my left shoulder, it just falls over. Same thing goes with left arm exercises- it just starts trembling and becomes useless after about 5 reps. Exercises I cannot do include shoulder presses, lat pulldowns, shoulder presses, dumbbell curls. Shoulder presses and dumbbell curls are the main exercises that show my problem. Even with ten reps of 5 pounds my arm starts falling over and becomes completely useless. I tried this for weeks without any progress. I can do leg exercises completely fine. Further, I have uneven arms and shoulders. I had my neurologist check for scoliosis, which I do not have. She told me my weakness is a result of brain surgery, which I don't know can cause this sort of limitation, especially because it doesn't get in the way of everyday tasks. I only notice it when trying to lift. I did some research, and came across something called hemiparesis. I'm wondering if this could be the issue/result of the brain surgery and is something my doctor didn't consider. If this is the condition, or if it isn't, is there anything I can do to fight this limitation? Could there be some type of treatment I can do to help with this? My information: Male, 22 years old, 5'5,",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to understand and address your concerns! Given your medical history, it's essential to consider the potential effects of your brain surgery on your motor function. I'll provide an overview of hemiparesis and other possible explanations for your symptoms. Please consult your neurologist or a rehabilitation specialist to discuss these possibilities and determine the best course of action.\n\n**Hemiparesis:**\nHemiparesis is a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, often resulting from brain damage, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, or brain surgery. It's possible that your AVM surgery could have caused damage to the motor control areas of your brain, leading to hemiparesis on the left side of your body. However, it's unusual for hemiparesis to only manifest during specific activities like weightlifting, as it typically affects everyday movements as well.\n\n**Other possible explanations:**\n\n1. **Motor cortex damage:** The motor cortex is the part of the brain responsible for controlling movement. During your AVM surgery, nearby areas of the motor cortex might have been damaged, leading to weakness or impaired motor control in your left arm and shoulder.\n2. **Corticospinal tract damage:** The corticospinal tract is a bundle of nerve fibers that carries motor signals from the brain to the spinal cord. Damage to this tract during surgery could affect motor function in your left arm and shoulder.\n3. **Radiation-induced damage:** If you received radiation therapy as part of your treatment, it's possible that the radiation caused damage to the surrounding brain tissue, leading to motor deficits.\n4. **Compensatory mechanisms:** After your brain surgery, your brain might have developed compensatory mechanisms to adapt to the damage. These mechanisms could be masking the weakness during everyday activities but become insufficient during more demanding tasks like weightlifting.\n\n**Treatment and management:**\nTo address your concerns, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult your neurologist:** Discuss your symptoms and research with your neurologist. They may refer you to a rehabilitation specialist, such as a physiatrist or an occupational therapist, to assess your motor function and develop a personalized treatment plan.\n2. **Physical therapy:** A physical therapist can help you develop a targeted exercise program to improve strength, endurance, and motor control in your left arm and shoulder. They may also use techniques like neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or functional electrical stimulation (FES) to enhance muscle activation.\n3. **Occupational therapy:** An occupational therapist can help you adapt your daily activities and weightlifting exercises to accommodate your weakness. They may also provide strategies to improve your overall motor function and coordination.\n4. **Neuroplasticity-based exercises:** Engage in exercises that promote neuroplasticity, such as mirror box therapy, constraint-induced movement therapy, or repetitive task-specific practice. These exercises can help your brain reorganize and adapt to the damaged areas.\n5. **Modify your weightlifting routine:** Consider working with a personal trainer or fitness coach to develop a modified weightlifting program that accommodates your weakness. You may need to start with lighter weights, focus on higher reps, or use alternative exercises that don't exacerbate the weakness.\n\n**Additional recommendations:**\n\n* Keep a symptom journal to track your progress, noting any changes in your strength, endurance, or motor control.\n* Consider consulting a sports medicine physician or a rehabilitation specialist who has experience with neurologic rehabilitation.\n* Be patient and don't push yourself too hard, as overexertion can lead to injury or frustration.\n\nIn conclusion, while hemiparesis is a possible explanation for your symptoms, it's essential to consult with your neurologist and a rehabilitation specialist to determine the underlying cause of your weakness. With a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan, you can work towards improving your motor function and adapting to your limitations."

I had just gotten off birth control to try and heal my body naturally. my seizures seem to align with my menstrual cycle. I\u2019m on Keppra and it\u2019s controlling my tonic clonic seizures but I have breakthrough absence seizures 3x a week. originally my first EEG only showed right temporal lobe seizures but my most recent EEG showed right and left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe seizures.while I was in the epilepsy monitoring unit last week for a 7 day EEG during a pretty intense grand mal seizure my heart rate hit 275 bpm. I\u2019ve always felt little heart flutters but this was intense. I have a Holter monitor now, and I was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. I\u2019m getting an ablation next week. the flutters happen after every seizure but sometimes just on their own without seizure activity.can someone please help me connect the dots, or point me in the direction of someone who can help? I\u2019m really up for any suggestions right now because I want to go back to my normal life. thank you!",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through all this. It's completely understandable that you're seeking help to connect the dots between your various medical issues. I'll do my best to provide a neutral and informative response.\n\n**Potential connections:**\n\n1. **Hormonal imbalance and seizures**: There's evidence to suggest that hormonal fluctuations, particularly estrogen, can affect seizure activity in women with epilepsy. The fact that your seizures seem to align with your menstrual cycle supports this idea.\n2. **Epilepsy and ovarian cysts**: Some studies have found a link between epilepsy and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is often associated with ovarian cysts. However, this relationship is still not fully understood and requires further research.\n3. **Hormonal birth control and seizures**: While birth control can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce seizure frequency in some women, it's not a guarantee, and the relationship between hormonal birth control and seizures is complex.\n4. **Cardiac issues and epilepsy**: The high heart rate (275 bpm) during your seizure is a concern. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) can be a comorbidity with epilepsy, and it's possible that your seizures are triggering or exacerbating your cardiac issues.\n5. **Endometriosis and epilepsy**: There's some evidence to suggest a link between endometriosis and epilepsy, although it's not fully understood. Endometriosis can cause inflammation and hormonal imbalances, which might contribute to seizure activity.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Multidisciplinary care**: Consider seeking care from a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurologist, gynecologist, cardiologist, and potentially an endocrinologist. This will help ensure that all your medical issues are being addressed and coordinated.\n2. **Comprehensive diagnostic workup**: Request a thorough evaluation, including:\n\t* Hormonal testing (e.g., FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone) to assess your hormonal balance.\n\t* Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound, MRI) to investigate potential endometriosis or PCOS.\n\t* A thorough cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram and stress test, to assess your heart function and SVT.\n3. **Seizure diary**: Keep a detailed seizure diary to track your seizures, including when they occur, their duration, and any potential triggers. This can help identify patterns and correlations between your seizures and other factors, such as your menstrual cycle.\n4. **Lifestyle modifications**: Consider making lifestyle changes to help manage your seizures and overall health, such as:\n\t* Stress reduction techniques (e.g., meditation, yoga).\n\t* Regular exercise.\n\t* Balanced diet.\n\t* Getting enough sleep.\n5. **Seek a specialist**: Look into consulting with a specialist, such as a:\n\t* Neurologist with expertise in epilepsy and women's health.\n\t* Gynecologist with experience in managing PCOS, endometriosis, and hormonal imbalances.\n\t* Cardiologist with expertise in arrhythmias and SVT.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n1. **Epilepsy organizations**: The Epilepsy Foundation (epilepsy.com) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ilae.org) offer valuable resources and information on epilepsy.\n2. **Women's health organizations**: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (acog.org) and the Endometriosis Association (endometriosisassn.org) provide information on women's health topics, including PCOS, endometriosis, and hormonal imbalances.\n3. **Support groups**: Join online forums or support groups, such as the Epilepsy Foundation's online community or Women with Epilepsy support group, to connect with others who may be experiencing similar issues.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work with your healthcare team to develop a personalized plan to manage your various medical conditions. Keep advocating for yourself, and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or additional expertise if needed."

        "question": "After standing from a prolonged period of sitting (especially when looking at a screen) I have 'episodes' which include spasms and staring. These occur multiple times a day, and I have had an ambulatory eeg. This has been happening for the last 4 years approximatelyThese came back to show that I don't have epilepsy, however my brain waves slow down and they suspect that I have mild cerebal hypoxia.My question is how bad is mild cerebal hypoxia because when severe, it can be very serious. Does the fact that it happens so frequently flag a matter of concern for my brain or general health?I have researched a little about this, but there's not much on mild cerebal hypoxis nor the frequency at which they occur in my personal case. I will be seeing a cardiology specialist at some point, but the waiting period could be very long.Information about myself: 19 male and have type 1 diabetes (since February 2016). Also I had a blood test in December, with all normal results. Apart from this, I have no other known medical conditions and am in relatively good shape.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide you with information about mild cerebral hypoxia and its potential implications. However, please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with a specialist (like the cardiology specialist you'll be seeing) for personalized advice and diagnosis.\n\nMild cerebral hypoxia refers to a condition where the brain experiences a temporary reduction in oxygen supply, but not to the extent that it causes significant damage or anoxic brain injury. In your case, the ambulatory EEG suggested that your brain waves slow down, which might be related to mild cerebral hypoxia.\n\nThe severity of cerebral hypoxia can vary, and mild cases might not lead to significant long-term consequences. However, the frequency and duration of these episodes could be a concern. The fact that you experience these episodes multiple times a day, triggered by standing after prolonged sitting, might indicate an underlying issue that needs attention.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for your symptoms:\n\n1. **Orthostatic hypotension**: This condition occurs when your blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing, which can lead to reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain. This might be exacerbated by your type 1 diabetes, as people with diabetes are more prone to orthostatic hypotension.\n2. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common condition where the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as standing, and causes a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain, leading to symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, and staring spells.\n3. **Autonomic nervous system dysfunction**: This could be related to your diabetes or other factors, where the autonomic nervous system (which regulates blood pressure, heart rate, and other functions) is not functioning properly, leading to episodes of cerebral hypoxia.\n\nGiven your age, type 1 diabetes, and relatively good physical shape, it's essential to investigate the underlying causes of these episodes. The fact that your blood test results were normal is reassuring, but it's still important to address the potential risk factors.\n\nTo manage your condition and potentially reduce the frequency and severity of these episodes, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help maintain blood volume and prevent dehydration.\n2. **Avoid prolonged sitting**: Take regular breaks to stand, stretch, and move around, especially when working or looking at screens.\n3. **Monitor your blood sugar levels**: Ensure that your diabetes is well-managed, as fluctuations in blood sugar levels can contribute to orthostatic hypotension and other symptoms.\n4. **Consider wearing compression stockings**: These can help improve blood flow and reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension.\n5. **Keep a symptom diary**: Record the frequency, duration, and triggers of your episodes to share with your cardiology specialist.\n\nWhen you see the cardiology specialist, be sure to discuss the following:\n\n1. **The frequency and duration of your episodes**: Share your symptom diary to help the specialist understand the pattern and severity of your condition.\n2. **Your diabetes management**: Discuss how your diabetes might be contributing to your symptoms and whether any adjustments to your management plan are necessary.\n3. **Potential underlying causes**: Explore the possibility of orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, or autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and discuss further testing or monitoring if needed.\n4. **Lifestyle modifications**: Ask about any lifestyle changes or recommendations to help reduce the frequency and severity of your episodes.\n\nIn the meantime, if you experience any of the following, seek medical attention:\n\n* Increased frequency or severity of episodes\n* Difficulty recovering from episodes\n* Worsening symptoms, such as confusion, disorientation, or loss of consciousness\n* New symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations\n\nRemember, while mild cerebral hypoxia might not be immediately life-threatening, it's essential to address the underlying causes and take steps to manage your condition to prevent potential long-term consequences."

Started having severe headaches with tingling and numbness in the face and limbs as well as weakness. Had motor ticks that were uncontrollable and sometimes painful due to their jerking motion. Had an mri that showed nothing other than white matter. Started having fainting spells that lasted for around 3 months before these dissipated. Visited a cardiologist during these fainting spells and they had determined there was nothing wrong with my heart. Had first convulsions during tonsil surgery which the doctors had said were a result of them trying to bring me off of sedation, they ended up having to re-sedate me for a few hours (no memory of this occurrence). The doctors who had done the surgery advised me to visit a neurologist since this would not have happened without a neurological problem present. Visit the neurologist that had diagnosed my migraines and was referred for an EEG. EEG showed normal brain activity and doctors said there were no findings that indicated anything wrong and there was nothing they could do for me. Motor ticks still present. Started having a strange sensation in head which were sometimes, but not always, accompanied by convulsions with loss of consciousness until current times. One of the most recent occurrences was when pulled over by a cop after dark(i was a passenger) and (i\u2019m assuming) the flashing lights caused me to collapse and convulse (i wouldn\u2019t consider this a reaction to stress since I have been pulled over during the daytime and had no issues). These convulsions most frequently occur when under the influence of substances, though they do occur at times when I am sober. Constant fatigue which may be due to anemia, and sleep 12 hours or more each night. Issues with long-term and short-term memory, as well as weakness in the limbs.

I am not on any medication or anything, my doctor could not diagnose me and just told me to live a healthy lifestyle. I am just desperate to put in the right direction to try find a diagnosis and a solution as it is so embarrassing and it affects my day to day life. Thank you for your time",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing these distressing episodes. It's completely understandable that you're seeking a diagnosis and solution. I'll do my best to provide guidance and suggestions to help you move forward.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've had an EEG and MRI scan in the past, which ruled out epilepsy and other structural brain abnormalities. Given your symptoms, it's possible that you may be experiencing a type of functional neurological disorder (FND) or a movement disorder. Here are a few potential avenues to explore:\n\n1. **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)**: FNDs are conditions where the brain's normal functioning is disrupted, leading to symptoms like weakness, tremors, or movement disorders. Your symptoms, such as losing control of your left side and facial scrunching, could be related to an FND. You may want to consult a neurologist who specializes in FNDs or a functional neurology clinic.\n2. **Movement Disorders**: Your symptoms could also be related to a movement disorder, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions) or hemifacial spasm (involuntary twitching or spasms on one side of the face). A movement disorders specialist or a neurologist with experience in movement disorders may be able to help.\n3. **Vasovagal Syncope**: As you mentioned that your episodes often occur when you stand up quickly or are nervous, it's possible that you may be experiencing vasovagal syncope (a type of fainting spell). This condition is often triggered by stress, anxiety, or sudden changes in blood pressure. A cardiologist or a neurologist may be able to investigate this further.\n4. **Anxiety and Stress**: Given that your episodes are often triggered by stress, anxiety, or nervousness, it's possible that addressing these underlying factors could help alleviate your symptoms. You may want to consider speaking with a mental health professional or a therapist to develop coping strategies and stress management techniques.\n\nTo move forward, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion**: Consult a neurologist or a specialist who has experience in FNDs, movement disorders, or functional neurology. They may be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis or suggest further testing.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Tracking your episodes, including when they occur, what triggers them, and how long they last, can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for your healthcare provider.\n3. **Explore stress management techniques**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, to help manage your anxiety and nervousness.\n4. **Consider a referral to a specialist clinic**: If possible, ask your primary care physician to refer you to a specialist clinic that deals with FNDs, movement disorders, or functional neurology.\n\nSome questions to ask your doctor or specialist:\n\n* What are the potential underlying causes of my symptoms?\n* Are there any additional tests or evaluations that can be done to help diagnose my condition?\n* What are the treatment options available for my condition, and what are their potential benefits and risks?\n* Are there any lifestyle changes or stress management techniques that can help alleviate my symptoms?\n\nRemember, it's essential to be persistent and advocate for yourself in your search for a diagnosis and solution. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or explore different specialists until you find one who can provide you with the guidance and support you need.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your journey toward finding answers and relief.

        "question": "[21M] epileptic from quemotherapy, and 5 years cancer free.Is there a variation that could allow me to safely take them? For instance \"lf you have X specific kind of epilepsy, or if you aren't taking X medication you can take them\" Does the dose matter? I have read people say that would have seizures when microdosing but not when doing high doses. How does that work? Thank you so much!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're cancer-free! Given your history of epilepsy induced by chemotherapy, it's essential to approach any new substance with caution. I'll provide general information, but please consult your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional before considering any new substances, especially if you have a history of seizures.\n\nRegarding psychedelics, such as LSD or psilocybin, there's limited research on their use in individuals with epilepsy. However, I can provide some general insights:\n\n1. **Seizure type and frequency**: The type and frequency of your seizures may influence the risk of psychedelic-induced seizures. If you have a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly known as grand mal seizures), you may be at higher risk. If your seizures are well-controlled with medication, the risk might be lower.\n2. **Medication interactions**: Certain antiepileptic medications, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital, may interact with psychedelics and increase the risk of seizures. Other medications, like valproate or levetiracetam, might have fewer interactions.\n3. **Dose and individual tolerance**: The relationship between dose and seizure risk is complex. Some people may experience seizures at low doses, while others may not have issues at higher doses. This could be due to individual differences in brain chemistry, medication interactions, or other factors.\n4. **Specific psychedelics**: Different psychedelics may have varying levels of seizure risk. For example, some studies suggest that psilocybin might be less likely to induce seizures compared to LSD.\n\nThe phenomenon of experiencing seizures at low doses but not at high doses is not fully understood. Several theories attempt to explain this:\n\n* **Biphasic response**: Some substances can exhibit a biphasic response, where low doses produce one effect and high doses produce the opposite effect. In the case of psychedelics, low doses might increase seizure susceptibility, while high doses might have a paradoxical effect, reducing seizure activity.\n* **Dose-dependent receptor activation**: Psychedelics can activate multiple receptor types, including serotonin and dopamine receptors. At low doses, they might activate receptors that increase seizure susceptibility, while at higher doses, they might activate receptors that have a protective effect against seizures.\n* **Individual variability**: People's brains are wired differently, and individual differences in brain chemistry, receptor expression, and neural connections can influence the response to psychedelics.\n\nTo minimize risks, it's essential to:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: Discuss your interest in psychedelics with your doctor, providing them with detailed information about your epilepsy, medication regimen, and medical history.\n2. **Choose a qualified guide or therapist**: If you decide to explore psychedelics, work with a qualified guide or therapist experienced in psychedelic-assisted therapy and familiar with epilepsy.\n3. **Start with low doses**: If you and your doctor decide to proceed, start with low doses and gradually increase them under close supervision, monitoring for any adverse effects.\n4. **Monitor your condition**: Regularly review your seizure activity, medication levels, and overall health with your doctor to ensure that any new substances are not exacerbating your condition.\n\nRemember, the safety of psychedelics in individuals with epilepsy is not well established, and more research is needed. Prioritize your health and consult with medical professionals before considering any new substances."

He takes lamotrigine, phenobarbital, Lamictal. He vapes, never drinks, and smokes marijuana on occasion. He hasn't had a seizure in three years fortunately. He went to the Dr yesterday and his Dr told him his med levels are at a level 2 when they should be at around a 7. Dr showed him that the levels dropped to dangerous levels in three years despite an increase in meds in those years. Any insight in what this could be? He's waiting on more blood tests.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide some general insights, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with a doctor for personalized advice.\n\nThe situation you've described is concerning, and it's great that your boyfriend is working with his doctor to investigate the cause of the decreased medication levels. Here are a few potential factors that might be contributing to the issue:\n\n1. **Medication interactions**: The combination of lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and Lamictal (which is another name for lamotrigine) may be interacting in a way that's affecting the medication levels. Phenobarbital, in particular, is known to induce liver enzymes, which can increase the metabolism of other medications, potentially leading to decreased levels.\n2. **Vaping**: Vaping has been shown to affect liver function and enzyme activity, which could influence medication metabolism. Some studies suggest that vaping may induce liver enzymes, similar to phenobarbital, potentially leading to decreased medication levels.\n3. **Marijuana use**: Marijuana can also interact with liver enzymes and affect medication metabolism. While the impact of marijuana on lamotrigine and phenobarbital levels is not well-studied, it's possible that occasional use could be contributing to the decreased medication levels.\n4. **Liver function**: Changes in liver function or enzyme activity could be affecting the metabolism of the medications. The doctor may want to investigate liver function tests (e.g., ALT, AST, bilirubin) to rule out any underlying liver issues.\n5. **Compliance and absorption**: Although you mentioned that your boyfriend hasn't had a seizure in three years, it's possible that there are issues with medication compliance (e.g., missing doses) or absorption (e.g., gastrointestinal issues). The doctor may want to discuss medication adherence and potential issues with absorption.\n6. **Other factors**: Other potential factors that could influence medication levels include changes in weight, diet, or physical activity. For example, significant weight changes can affect the volume of distribution of medications, potentially leading to altered levels.\n\nThe doctor will likely investigate these potential factors through additional blood tests, such as:\n\n* Liver function tests (e.g., ALT, AST, bilirubin)\n* Medication level tests (to confirm the decreased levels and monitor any changes)\n* Tests to evaluate liver enzyme activity (e.g., cytochrome P450 enzyme tests)\n* Screening for other potential causes of decreased medication levels (e.g., kidney function tests)\n\nIt's essential for your boyfriend to follow up with his doctor and discuss the results of the additional blood tests. The doctor may need to adjust his medication regimen or investigate other potential causes of the decreased medication levels. In the meantime, it's crucial for your boyfriend to continue taking his medications as prescribed and attend follow-up appointments to monitor his condition."

        "question": "Age: 21 Sex: Female (But I go by He/Him) Height: 5'3 Weight: 106lbsOver the past few months I've been seeing a psychiatrist and she's put me on numerous pills. The first set of pills were Wellbutrin XL 300mg (One I'd already been taking) Venalafaxine ER 37.5mg, Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg, and Ondansetron 4mg. So far my only \"diagnosed\" issues are depression and a very severe panic/ anxiety disorder so these were meant to help me avoid panic attacks, mood swings, depression and nausea. However, I also explained that sometimes I smoke weed, she said I should avoid it, but occasionally it'd be fine. Same with Alcohol. So far alcohol has been just fine, but when I did weed It was a horrifying experience for me and my family. My body wouldn't stop shaking, all of my muscles felt tight and for some period of time I couldn't move and my breathing was very forced? I also was hallucinating bad. I kept asking my mom to look at my stomach because there was an air bubble that would travel to my heart and kill me. And I was so afraid I was going to die, but my mom kept assuring me that I was fine and that I was probably just tripping and that I needed to sleep. But I was so scared and didn't want to die alone so I slept in her room. It's been a few weeks since then and I haven't touched anything weed related since. But I still feel... Like ever since then I'm not exactly the same? I've been more suicidal than I've ever been in my life, and my muscles and joints feel bruised and I can barely stand to go grocery shopping my body feels so tired and in pain like I've run a marathon. Like I explained this to my psych and she didn't really seem to care. She's now got me on Oxcarbazepine 150mg that I take 2 times daily, along with everything else I was taking. I still have to take the Venalafaxine, but I'm weaning off of it. But so far I am still anxious, suicidal, and in more pain than I've ever been. And every now and then I'm seeing things like a weird grey cloud with a face in my bedroom or I'll think my hands are turning grey when they aren't.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to provide support and help you understand what might be going on. It sounds like you've been through a really tough experience with the reaction to weed, and it's understandable that it's had a lasting impact on you.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that your psychiatrist may not have fully appreciated the severity of your experience with weed. The symptoms you described, such as muscle rigidity, hallucinations, and intense fear, are not uncommon when combining certain medications with cannabis. It's possible that the interaction between the weed and your medications, particularly the Venlafaxine, may have contributed to this reaction.\n\nGiven your history of depression and anxiety, it's concerning that you're experiencing increased suicidal thoughts and feelings of hopelessness. It's essential to prioritize your mental health and seek help from your psychiatrist or a crisis hotline if you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe addition of Oxcarbazepine to your medication regimen may be an attempt to address your ongoing anxiety and mood symptoms. However, it's crucial to monitor your response to this new medication and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nRegarding your physical symptoms, such as muscle pain and fatigue, it's possible that these could be related to the medication changes, the lingering effects of the weed reaction, or an underlying condition that needs attention. I would encourage you to discuss these symptoms with your psychiatrist and consider consulting with a primary care physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nThe visual disturbances you're experiencing, such as seeing a grey cloud with a face or thinking your hands are turning grey, could be related to the Oxcarbazepine or another medication. These types of symptoms can be unsettling, and it's essential to report them to your psychiatrist.\n\nTo better support you, I would recommend:\n\n1. **Follow up with your psychiatrist**: Schedule an urgent appointment to discuss your concerns, suicidal thoughts, and physical symptoms. Be honest about your feelings and experiences, and ask for a thorough review of your medication regimen.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your symptoms, including when they occur, their severity, and any potential triggers. This can help you and your psychiatrist identify patterns and make informed decisions about your treatment.\n3. **Consider a second opinion**: If you feel like your concerns are not being adequately addressed, it may be helpful to consult with another psychiatrist or a therapist who can provide additional support and guidance.\n4. **Reach out to crisis resources**: If you're experiencing intense suicidal thoughts or feelings of hopelessness, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255)) or text the Crisis Text Line (text \"HOME\" to 741741) in the US.\n\nRemember, your mental health and well-being are essential, and it's crucial to prioritize them. You deserve to feel supported and heard, and I'm here to help you navigate this challenging time."

        "question": "As a preface, just want to include that I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled for these issues, but just wanted to get other people's opinions to see if I'm overthinking things. 5'10, about average weight, no drug use except nicotine. These symptoms precede any nicotine use, and seem unaffected by it. I have no history of seizures in early childhood, although a lot of the symptoms I list below have affected me since I was about 10. I do seem to have a family history with epilepsy, although I don't know all of the details. A few weeks back, I was reading a book -- and at one point, the author went into detail about Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Interested by the concept, I looked it up, and found that many of the symptoms seem to line up with what I had called my migraine auras for years. Random tastes or smells, always enjoyable but never lasting for more than 5 seconds. Bursts of euphoria for absolutely no reason, gone within a minute or two. Strong dissociation at times, linked to no negative events, just out of nowhere. I thought this was interesting but didn't investigate it further until I thought about my sleep issues. If I don't sleep well, and attempt to nap later in the day, sleeping is sometimes nearly impossible. I'll instead be essentially semi-conscious, in a dream-like state, seeing random events unfold. When I \"wake up\" from these, my body feels as if it's buzzing, I feel completely exhausted, and I have no memory of the specific things I saw other than they occurred. I have no idea how long these moments last. And, the last issue, also sleep related and usually occurs again if I'm tired and attempt to nap -- I'll be able to fall asleep, but as I wake up, I'll feel locked-in, similar to sleep paralysis. I feel that same buzzing again, throughout my head and torso, and my head particularly seems to move around quickly. A couple weeks back this resulted in me (luckily, not too painfully) hitting my head against the wall. I only truly remembered that happening the next evening. As far as I remember, I went back to sleep after it happened with no further incidents. Thanks for any advice or opinions you may have :)",

I'll offer some general insights and observations, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and only a qualified doctor can provide a proper diagnosis and guidance.\n\nYour symptoms do seem intriguing, and it's interesting that you've been experiencing them since childhood. The combination of symptoms you've described, such as:\n\n1. Random tastes or smells (possibly indicative of simple partial seizures)\n2. Bursts of euphoria without reason (could be related to temporal lobe activity)\n3. Dissociation (may be linked to seizure activity or other neurological factors)\n4. Sleep-related issues, including:\n\t* Semi-conscious, dream-like states with no memory of the events (could be related to seizure activity or sleep disorders)\n\t* Locked-in feelings, sleep paralysis, and buzzing sensations (may be indicative of seizure activity or other neurological conditions)\n5. Family history of epilepsy (increases the likelihood of a possible seizure disorder)\n\nWhile these symptoms do share some similarities with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), it's essential to remember that only a thorough medical evaluation can determine the cause of your symptoms. TLE is a complex condition, and diagnosis typically requires a combination of:\n\n* Clinical evaluation\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG) tests\n* Imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scans)\n* Sleep studies (if sleep-related symptoms are prominent)\n\nIt's also important to consider other potential explanations for your symptoms, such as:\n\n* Migraines (as you've previously thought)\n* Sleep disorders (e.g., narcolepsy, insomnia, or sleep apnea)\n* Anxiety or other mental health conditions\n* Other neurological conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, neuromuscular disorders)\n\nDuring your doctor's appointment, be sure to discuss all your symptoms in detail, including:\n\n* The frequency, duration, and triggers of each symptom\n* Any potential patterns or correlations between symptoms\n* Your family medical history, including any known cases of epilepsy or other neurological conditions\n* Your nicotine use and any other substance use (even if you don't think it's related)\n\nIn preparation for your appointment, you may want to keep a symptom journal to track when these events occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers or patterns.

        "answer": "I'm glad you're reaching out for guidance! I'll try to provide some input, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult your doctor or a qualified healthcare expert for a thorough evaluation.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on taking the first step in seeking help for your MDD and starting medication. It's great that you're being proactive about your mental health!\n\nNow, regarding the incident:\n\n1. **Low appetite and forgetting to eat**: This is a common side effect of many antidepressants, including Prozac. Make sure to discuss this with your doctor, and they may recommend ways to manage your appetite or adjust your medication.\n2. **Fainting or seizure-like episode**: It's understandable that you're concerned, especially given the context of starting a new medication. However, based on your partner's description, it's possible that you might have experienced a **vasovagal syncope** (a type of fainting spell) rather than a seizure. Vasovagal syncope can be triggered by various factors, including:\n\t* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) due to not eating\n\t* Dehydration\n\t* Stress or anxiety\n\t* Certain medications (although Prozac and Lamictal are not typically associated with vasovagal syncope)\n\t* Marijuana use (which can cause orthostatic hypotension, a sudden drop in blood pressure)\n3. **Lucid dream**: While interesting, this might not be directly related to the episode. Lucid dreaming can occur in various states, including during fainting or sleep.\n4. **Serotonin syndrome**: Although it's a potential concern when combining medications that affect serotonin levels, your symptoms don't strongly suggest serotonin syndrome. This condition typically presents with more severe symptoms, such as:\n\t* Confusion\n\t* Agitation\n\t* Rapid heart rate\n\t* Changes in blood pressure\n\t* Muscle rigidity\n\t* Heavy sweating\n\t* Diarrhea\n\nConsidering your situation, it's essential to:\n\n* **Consult your doctor** as soon as possible to discuss the episode and your concerns.

        "question": "Hi. I\u2019m 22F. So 5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's unacceptable that you've had to endure such a rollercoaster of experiences with your epilepsy treatment. I'll try to break down some possible reasons why things may have gone downhill:\n\n1. **Insufficient understanding of myoclonic seizures**: It's concerning that none of your neurologists seemed to fully understand or acknowledge your myoclonic seizures. This lack of recognition may have led to inadequate treatment and monitoring.\n2. **Stopping medication too soon**: Stopping medication after only 3 years of being seizure-free may have been premature, especially considering you were still experiencing myoclonic seizures. This decision may have been based on incomplete information or an overly optimistic assessment of your condition.\n3. **Inadequate dosing and transition**: The sudden switch from 500mg Keppra to 25mg Lamotrigine without proper guidance or monitoring may have led to a significant decrease in therapeutic coverage, exacerbating your seizures.\n4. **Lack of communication and coordination**: The lack of clear instructions on how to manage the transition from Keppra to Lamotrigine, as well as the inconsistent messaging from different neurologists, may have contributed to the chaos you experienced.\n5. **Underdosing and overdosing**: The initial prescription of 25mg Lamotrigine was likely too low, while the subsequent addition of 1g Keppra morning and night may have been an overcorrection.\n6. **Polypharmacy and interactions**: The combination of Lamotrigine and Keppra, as well as the addition of Clobazam, may be contributing to your ongoing seizures. The interactions between these medications can be complex, and it's possible that the current regimen is not optimized for your specific needs.\n7. **Sleep and stress**: The initial trigger for your recent seizure activity was sleep deprivation, which can be a significant stressor for people with epilepsy. The subsequent stress and anxiety may have further exacerbated your condition.\n\nTo move forward, it's essential to:\n\n1. **Find a neurologist who listens and understands**: You deserve a healthcare provider who takes your experiences and concerns seriously. Consider seeking a second opinion or finding a new neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.\n2. **Re-evaluate your treatment plan**: Work with your new neurologist to reassess your medication regimen and adjust it as needed. This may involve tweaking dosages, adding or removing medications, or exploring alternative treatments.\n3. **Develop a personalized seizure management plan**: Create a plan that takes into account your specific needs, including strategies for managing sleep, stress, and seizure triggers.\n4. **Prioritize self-care and stress management**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as exercise, meditation, or therapy, to help mitigate the emotional impact of your experiences.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this journey. There are resources available to help you navigate the complexities of epilepsy management. Consider reaching out to organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation or connecting with online support groups to find community and guidance.\n\nHow do you feel about seeking a new neurologist or re-evaluating your treatment plan? Is there anything specific that you're concerned about or would like to prioritize in your care?"

        "question": "Hi all, yesterday I (20F) went to the beach. I was feeling fine, talking to my family, and then all I remember is laying on my side in the sand with a lot of concerned people around me. Apparently I seized up, fell back into the sand, and was clutching at the air with a pained expression before falling completely unconscious and drooling foam (doing some of my own research, I'm guessing this was a tonic-clonic seizure, as I was \"out\" for several minutes after the muscle spasms). After waking up, I was unable to tell the medics my age \u2014 it was as if I'd forgotten what numbers were, it was scary.I was promptly taken to the nearest ER and spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening doing blood tests, a urine test, an EKG, and a CT scan. So far, everything looks normal. I was given fluids and eventually discharged. Later this week I'll have an MRI done, and I have an unrelated neurologist appointment to follow up about chronic headaches (I will definitely mention the seizure).Since being discharged I've been pretty steady on my feet, just tired and achy in my arms and back. I have some mild tremors in my hands and legs but those predate the seizure. I'm limiting my screen time and will not be driving for a little while. I've also been instructed to lower my dosage of Wellbutrin as it carries a higher seizure risk. I'm staying with my family over the summer, thus I won't be alone if something were to happen at home. My partner is an EMT which gives me more comfort if something were to happen at her place.My first question is: how common is this type of thing? I'd only heard of epilepsy causing seizures before yesterday, and all of my testing so far shows no abnormalities. My second question is: should I wait a while before returning to hobbies like dancing or using my sewing machine?

        "answer": "I'm so glad you're taking this experience seriously and seeking advice. I'll do my best to provide you with helpful information.\n\n**First question: How common is this type of thing?**\n\nSeizures can occur in people without a history of epilepsy, and they're more common than you might think. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, about 1 in 10 people will experience a seizure in their lifetime. However, only about 1% of the population will develop epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent seizures.\n\nThere are many potential causes of seizures, including:\n\n1. Head injuries or trauma\n2. Infections (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis)\n3. Stroke or brain tumors\n4. Medications (like Wellbutrin, as you mentioned)\n5. Electrolyte imbalances\n6. Sleep deprivation\n7. Certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, thyroid disorders)\n\nIn your case, since your initial tests (blood work, urine test, EKG, and CT scan) didn't reveal any abnormalities, it's possible that the seizure was an isolated incident or related to a specific trigger (e.g., dehydration, overheating, or medication side effect). The upcoming MRI will help rule out any structural brain abnormalities.\n\n**Second question: Should you wait before returning to hobbies like dancing or using your sewing machine?**\n\nIt's great that you're being cautious! After a seizure, it's essential to take some time to recover and assess your risk of having another seizure. While it's impossible to completely eliminate the risk, you can take steps to minimize it.\n\nFor now, it's a good idea to avoid activities that could pose a risk to yourself or others if you were to have another seizure. This includes:\n\n1. Operating heavy machinery (like your sewing machine)\n2. Engaging in high-impact activities (like dancing) that could lead to injury if you were to lose control or fall\n3. Activities that require intense focus or coordination (e.g., driving, cycling)\n\nWait until you've had a chance to discuss your situation with your neurologist and get their guidance on when it's safe to resume these activities. They may recommend a specific waiting period or provide additional instructions based on your individual situation.\n\nIn the meantime, consider low-impact activities that don't pose a significant risk, such as:\n\n1. Gentle stretching or yoga\n2. Reading or listening to music\n3. Spending time with family and friends\n\n**Additional advice:**\n\n1. Keep a seizure journal to track any potential triggers, symptoms, or unusual feelings you experience.\n2. Make sure your family and partner are aware of what to do if you have another seizure (e.g., turn you onto your side, keep you safe, and call emergency services).\n3. Follow up with your neurologist as scheduled, and be open about any concerns or questions you have.\n4. Consider consulting with your primary care physician about adjusting your Wellbutrin dosage or exploring alternative medications.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health and safety. Take this time to focus on your recovery, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team if you have any further questions or concerns."

        "question": "Hello, I am 24 and I was diagnosed with epilepsy around 2 years ago, and prior to this I thought epilepsy was 1) you were born with it, and 2) it was caused due to flashing lights. My epilepsy seemingly comes out of nowhere, it is not caused by ANYTHING. (I don't know my specific weight, this is just for the subreddit rules - I'm the average weight for a UK male) Absolutely nothing seems to triggers my seizures, I have only ever had 1 seizure in public, and that was the first one I ever had. I have been clubs, I have been night clubs, flashing lights do not effect me, they just seemingly occur out of nowhere, and I was hoping someone could give me more information on this kind of thing.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're reaching out for more information and support! First, let me clarify that epilepsy is a complex condition, and there's still much to be learned about it.\n\nYou're not alone in thinking that epilepsy is only caused by genetic factors or flashing lights. However, the reality is that epilepsy can be caused by various factors, and in some cases, the cause may remain unknown.\n\nThere are several types of epilepsy, and it's possible that you have a type that is not related to specific triggers like flashing lights. Some people with epilepsy may experience seizures that seem to occur randomly, without any identifiable cause or trigger. This is often referred to as \"unprovoked\" or \"cryptogenic\" epilepsy.\n\nCryptogenic epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where the cause of the seizures is unknown. It's estimated that up to 60% of people with epilepsy have cryptogenic epilepsy. In these cases, the seizures may seem to occur out of nowhere, without any obvious trigger or warning sign.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been able to participate in activities like going to clubs and nightclubs without any issues related to flashing lights. This suggests that you may not have photosensitive epilepsy, which is a type of epilepsy that is triggered by visual stimuli like flashing lights.\n\nSince you've only had one seizure in public, and it was your first seizure, it's possible that you may have a type of epilepsy that is characterized by infrequent seizures. Your doctor or neurologist may have discussed your specific type of epilepsy with you, but if you're unsure, it's always a good idea to ask for more information.\n\nTo better understand your epilepsy, you may want to ask your doctor or neurologist the following questions:\n\n1. What type of epilepsy do I have, and what are the characteristics of this type?\n2. Are there any potential underlying causes of my epilepsy that we haven't explored yet?\n3. Are there any lifestyle changes or modifications that I can make to reduce my risk of seizures?\n4. What are the chances of me having another seizure, and how can we work together to manage my condition?\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your epilepsy and develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find it helpful to connect with others who have epilepsy, either online or in-person. Sharing your experiences and hearing the stories of others can be incredibly supportive and informative.\n\nHow do you feel about discussing your epilepsy with others, and have you connected with any support groups or online communities yet?"

        "question": "I am not a doctor, but I know my body and I am no fool. I also try to avoid going to the doctor unless necessary, so I try to make sure I have to go before I do. My doctors tend to mark me up to either being a hypochondriac or having drug seeking behaviour.For example: I have very severe epilepsy, and the Keppra I am on is no longer working; I am having multiple seizures in a row every month along with, almost constant myoclonic jerks in my legs. I asked my doctor to please change me from the Keppra about 6 months ago, when it first started showing signs of no longer working. Last month I had 9 focal-to-generalized seizures without becoming aware between them.In short, pharmaceutical companies tell me to ask my doctor about certain meds, but when I do, they blow me off.Bonus Question: What do you recommend for these seizures? They are almost always triggered by hormones, stress level, and being asleep.Thanks in advance!",

        "answer": "The challenges of navigating the healthcare system can be frustrating, especially when you feel like your concerns are being dismissed. It's completely reasonable to want to take an active role in managing your health, and it's great that you're advocating for yourself.\n\nTo better understand your situation, I would recommend keeping a seizure journal to track when your seizures occur, including the date, time, and any potential triggers you notice. This can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for your doctor.\n\nIn terms of medication, there are several alternatives to Keppra that your doctor may consider. Some options might include:\n\n*   **Lamotrigine (Lamictal)**: This medication is often used to treat focal seizures and generalized seizures.\n*   **Topiramate (Topamax)**: This medication can be effective for treating focal seizures, generalized seizures, and seizures triggered by hormonal changes.\n*   **Levetiracetam (Keppra XR)**: This is an extended-release version of Keppra, which may help maintain a more consistent level of medication in your system.\n\nWhen discussing these options with your doctor, it may be helpful to provide as much detail as possible about your seizures, including:\n\n1.  The frequency and duration of your seizures\n2.  Any patterns or triggers you've noticed\n3.  How your seizures affect your daily life\n4.  Any concerns or questions you have about potential side effects or interactions with other medications\n\nAdvocating for yourself and seeking a second opinion from a neurologist or epilepsy specialist may also be helpful. They can provide more specialized guidance and help you develop a treatment plan that better addresses your needs."

        "question": "My partner (28M) used to have over 50 grand mal seizures a month after a car accident. They had their front temporal lobe removed a couple of years ago to reduce them and that seemed to help. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t known him long and we have only been living together for about 4 weeks. He had one grand mal a couple of weeks ago and I made sure to catch him before he fell, laid him on his side, and stayed with him until he came to. I informed his grandmother as well because he lived with her before this and I honestly was scared. Well, today he has had 1 cognitive seizure this morning and now we\u2019re up to four grand mal seizures. His grandmother is telling me this happens sometimes but it\u2019s seriously scaring me. He\u2019s in pain and his family is saying not to call an ambulance because he will lose his license and I know he would hate me for that. I\u2019ve been trying to make sure that he stays hydrated and takes his medicine in the small windows that he\u2019s awake and coherent, but he\u2019s being a jerk to me when he is awake, saying that I\u2019m bothering him and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any medicine\u201d. I love this person with all my heart and want to get him help, but his family would know more about his condition than I would. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated",

        "answer": "I can sense the concern and uncertainty you're feeling. It's completely understandable, given the situation. I'll try to offer some guidance and support.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're taking care of your partner and trying to ensure his safety and well-being. However, it's essential to prioritize his health and seek medical attention if you believe it's necessary.\n\nWhile it's true that his family may have more experience with his condition, it's also important to remember that you're now a part of his life and have a unique perspective on his current situation. Don't underestimate your own instincts and observations.\n\nThe fact that he's had multiple grand mal seizures in a short period is a cause for concern. Cognitive seizures can also be a warning sign that his condition is not well-controlled. It's possible that his medication needs to be adjusted or that there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nRegarding his family's concerns about calling an ambulance, it's understandable that they want to protect his driving privileges. However, if you genuinely believe that his condition is worsening or that he's in immediate danger, it's crucial to prioritize his health and safety over concerns about his license.\n\nIt's also important to address the dynamic between you and your partner. While it's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to be irritable or resistant to help during or after seizures, it's essential to communicate with him calmly and empathetically. Try to reassure him that you're coming from a place of love and concern, and that you want to support him in getting the help he needs.\n\nHere are some potential steps you could consider:\n\n1. **Encourage him to see his neurologist**: Given the increase in seizures, it's likely that his medication needs to be adjusted or that there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Try to persuade him to schedule an appointment with his neurologist as soon as possible.\n2. **Keep a seizure journal**: Start documenting the frequency, duration, and severity of his seizures. This can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for his healthcare team.\n3. **Reach out to his healthcare team**: If you're concerned about his condition and feel that his family is not taking the necessary steps, consider contacting his neurologist or healthcare team directly. They can offer guidance and support, and help you develop a plan to manage his condition.\n4. **Seek support for yourself**: Caring for someone with a chronic condition can be emotionally challenging. Consider reaching out to a support group or a counselor who can provide you with emotional support and guidance.\n5. **Have an open and honest conversation**: When your partner is feeling calm and coherent, try to have an open and honest conversation about your concerns and fears. Listen to his perspective and work together to find a solution that prioritizes his health and well-being.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your partner's health and safety, even if it means having difficult conversations or seeking outside help. You're not alone in this, and there are resources available to support both of you.\n\nPlease take care of yourself and your partner during this challenging time. If you need additional guidance or support, feel free to ask."

        "question": "gender (male) age (17) can anxiety or stress lead to epilepsy and seizures without being prone to one all your life ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "As a 17-year-old male, it's essential to understand the relationship between anxiety, stress, and epilepsy/seizures.\n\n**Can anxiety or stress trigger epilepsy/seizures in someone without a pre-existing condition?**\n\nWhile anxiety and stress can't directly cause epilepsy, they can contribute to the development of seizures in certain situations. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. **Stress and anxiety can trigger seizures in people with pre-existing epilepsy**: For individuals with a history of epilepsy, stress and anxiety can trigger seizures, especially if they have a condition like temporal lobe epilepsy.\n2. **Stress and anxiety can contribute to the development of seizures in susceptible individuals**: Research suggests that chronic stress and anxiety can increase the likelihood of seizures in people with a genetic predisposition to epilepsy, even if they've never had a seizure before.\n3. **Stress and anxiety can lead to seizures in rare cases, without a pre-existing condition**: Although extremely rare, it's possible for someone without a history of epilepsy to experience a seizure due to extreme stress or anxiety. This is often referred to as a \"stress-induced seizure\" or \"anxiety-induced seizure.\"\n\n**What are the underlying mechanisms?**\n\nWhen we experience stress or anxiety, our body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can affect the brain's electrical activity, potentially leading to abnormal electrical discharges that can cause a seizure.\n\n**Other factors that may contribute to stress/anxiety-induced seizures:**\n\n* Sleep deprivation\n* Certain medications or substances (e.g., benzodiazepine withdrawal)\n* Underlying neurological conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury, infections)\n* Hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation, menopause)\n\n**Reducing the risk of stress/anxiety-induced seizures:**\n\nWhile it's impossible to completely eliminate the risk, you can take steps to manage stress and anxiety:\n\n1. **Practice stress-reducing techniques**: Regular exercise, meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help.\n2. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n3. **Maintain a healthy lifestyle**: Eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and avoid substances that can trigger seizures (e.g., excessive caffeine, recreational drugs).\n4. **Seek professional help**: If you're experiencing overwhelming anxiety or stress, consult a mental health professional for support.\n\nIn summary, while anxiety and stress can't directly cause epilepsy, they can contribute to the development of seizures in certain situations, especially in individuals with a pre-existing condition or a genetic predisposition. By managing stress and anxiety, you can reduce the risk of experiencing a seizure. If you have concerns or questions, consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice."

        "question": "My daughter 13(F).She is 5'6\", 120 pounds, white--she's lost 5 pounds in the past 3-4 months and is already quite skinny. She's been complaining about abdominal pain (located 1/2 inch above her belly button and across the whole abdominal area, but has had bouts of localized pain more to the right of her navel) since April and it's worsened in the last 3 months significantly.It's worse after eating and after any activity (including just walking around). She says the pain feels stabbing/throbbing-like. She is not eating much because she does not feel hungry and complains of a feeling like there is a lump in her throat. Today, she had multiple instances of dizziness/lightheadedness and fell down from it.She has an extensive medical history, but her current diagnoses are: Epilepsy (since she was 2, more specifically Abnormal Doose Syndrome) Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder (not Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome) Raynauds ADHD Sensory Processing Disorder Neuropathy Temperature Regulation Issues Anhidrosis Generalized Anxiety Insomnia (clinically diagnosed) Additional information on Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder:She can void on her own, but her bladder is 2x larger than it should be and she was catheterized for 4 years before she figured out how to void on her own. She still does not have proper sensation and VCUG has shown her bladder does not \"respond\" when full, but she's figured out how to tell and how to make herself void well enough catheterization is no longer necessary.Her colon is also 2x larger than it should be with multiple redundencies, but the placement of them would place scar tissue too close to the rectum and would cause a higher chance of blockages and cause the colon to stretch out again. Her internal sphincters do not work properly (for both bladder and bowel). She is on a high regiment of medications and still only eliminates about every other day.Current Medications: Linzess (290mg/daily) for bowels Lactulose (30mg/twice daily) for bowels    Bisacodyl (5mg every other day and 10mg on the other days) for bowels  MagCalm (magnesium citrate, 4mg/daily) + 32mg/monthly for mini cleanout of bowels (increased to 68mg for full cleanout of bowels)Lamictal (20mg/twice daily) for epilepsyKeppra (1250mg/twice daily) for epilepsyClonidine (5mg/daily) for insomniaDaily vitamin + iron fortification for childrenAll blood work has come back normal so far:CBC Differential with PlateletComp.

I'll do my best to provide some possible insights and suggestions, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to work closely with her healthcare team to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\n\nGiven her complex medical history, it's challenging to pinpoint a single cause for her abdominal pain and other symptoms. However, I'll highlight some potential areas to explore:\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal issues**: Her Neurogenic Bladder & Bowel Disorder, combined with her bowel medication regimen, might be contributing to her abdominal pain. The fact that her colon is larger than usual and has redundancies could lead to bowel obstruction, chronic constipation, or other issues. The feeling of a lump in her throat might be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or dysphagia.\n2. **Epilepsy and medication side effects**: Some antiepileptic medications, like Lamictal and Keppra, can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including abdominal pain, nausea, and changes in appetite. It's possible that her medication regimen is contributing to her symptoms.\n3. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Her limited diet and lack of hunger might lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her overall condition. Ensuring she receives adequate nutrition, possibly through supplements or a feeding tube (if necessary), might help alleviate some symptoms.\n4. **Anxiety and stress**: Her generalized anxiety and sensory processing disorder might be exacerbating her abdominal pain and other symptoms. Stress management techniques, such as relaxation exercises, deep breathing, or therapy, could help mitigate these effects.\n5. **Neuropathic pain**: Her neuropathy and abnormal pain processing might contribute to her chronic pain. Consulting a pain management specialist or a neurologist might help develop a plan to address this aspect of her condition.\n6. **Other potential causes**: Other possible causes of her abdominal pain, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), functional abdominal pain syndrome, or even mitochondrial disorders, should be explored through further testing and evaluation.\n\nTo move forward, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult her healthcare team**: Share this information with her primary care physician, gastroenterologist, and other specialists involved in her care. They can help determine the next steps in evaluating and managing her symptoms.\n2. **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: Schedule a thorough gastrointestinal evaluation, including:\n\t* Upper endoscopy to rule out gastrointestinal inflammation or obstruction.\n\t* Colonoscopy to assess her colon and rule out IBD or other conditions.\n\t* Small intestine follow-through or an MRI to evaluate her small intestine.\n3. **Pain management**: Consult a pain management specialist or a neurologist to develop a plan to address her chronic pain.\n4. **Nutritional support**: Ensure she receives adequate nutrition, possibly through supplements or a feeding tube (if necessary).\n5. **Stress management**: Encourage stress-reducing techniques, such as relaxation exercises, deep breathing, or therapy, to help manage her anxiety and sensory processing disorder.\n6. **Keep a symptom journal**: Encourage your daughter to keep a detailed journal of her symptoms, including pain levels, bowel movements, and any potential triggers or exacerbating factors.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work collaboratively with her healthcare team to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan."

        "question": "I (29F) have been having extremely harsh symptoms lately and am currently undergoing a lot of testing while my doctors try to figure out what is happening. I have been to several doctors and they have different opinions on what\u2019s going on. Because the tests are all coming back inconclusive, I\u2019m hoping this sub can help me.History:I\u2019ve been on antidepressants for over 8 years, my current combination (Wellbutrin & Cymbalta) for over two years without any noticeable side effects. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs other than the occasional edible. I\u2019m diagnosed with chronic depression and IBS. The consumption of edibles (I\u2019ve tried HHC and THC, to relax and take away pain) seems to worsen my symptoms, even at low doses.Symptoms:Seizures - Started about a month ago, have had maybe one/two per week since. Whether or not they are seizures is debated as my doctors don\u2019t all agree what I have are seizures. One of them called it chorea, another called it focal aware seizures and my psychiatrist says it could be tardive dyskinesia. (I have had a tardive dyskinesia episode once as a reaction to metaclopramide and it didn\u2019t feel at all like this. The uncontrollable movements were restricted to my face and I was perfectly fine mentally.) I have uncontrollable movements all over my body but I\u2019m conscious throughout. The episodes last anywhere from 2 minutes to a half hour. My body feels rigid and the longer it goes on the more I feel like my mind is shattered. I can feel my thought process is impaired during an episode but I\u2019m not unresponsive and can communicate with a lot of effort.Extreme fatigue - I have previously been to doctors because of this (about a year ago). I can sleep for 24 hours straight if no one wakes me up. Doctors suspected narcolepsy but I never actually did the tests because they were too expensive. It was chalked up to my depression.Painful joints - the pain shifts places but the most affected areas are my right hip joint and my hands.Mouth sores - they\u2019re painful and take around a week to heal.Dry chapped lips - this has been happening since I remember, my lips are always dry to the point of pain. For example, if I don\u2019t put on a thick layer of chapstick before bed, I wake up with my lips cracked and bleeding.Low fevers the week before my period - has been going on for about a year. Can\u2019t find an underlying reason for this.Hair loss - something I\u2019ve chalked up to my depression over the years but I now have places where my hair density is really low.Diagnosis - No idea. Rheumatologist says it might be lupus, told me to do blood work the week before my period to coincide with my symptoms worsening.Tests done:EEG - no epileptic activityBrain CT - normalBlood tests all normal, including rheumatoid factor.Haven\u2019t yet done ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4 and a couple other things.Thank you in advance!",

        "question": "I am currently a 27yo (white) male (6ft, 150lb) and starting back when I was early 26yo, I started developing epilepsy\u2014frequent episodes of focal-aware seizures. Around that time, I also experienced a few separate occasions of non-trauma-induced, spontaneous compression fractures that would occur in my sleep (I\u2019d wake up with extreme back pain and unable to move, get out of bed, or walk for awhile).I was subsequently discovered to have numerous fresh compression fractures along my thoracic vertebrae (seven thoracic vertebrae fractured to various degrees\u2014some significantly: 50-70% LOH) along with having low bone density that my doctors described as \u201costeoporosis\u201d (Z-score -2.4).Since then, over the last year and a half, I have seen many specialists (primary care doctors, neurologist, spine doctors, interventional radiology, and endocrinologist) and have undergone every test possible to investigate why I have low bone density and fragility fractures; but overall, my labs and results come back mostly normal, and no known cause has yet been found.I have a history of being overall healthy, well nourished, and a long-time jogger and physically active. I never smoked or done recreational drugs, and I very rarely drink alcohol or soda. Only medication I have ever been on prior is Lexapro for depression, which I have been taking for past five years. I don\u2019t have any family history of bad bones or epilepsy.Your thoughts?",

        "answer": "I'll provide a neutral, informative response. Please note that I'm not a medical professional, and my response shouldn't be taken as a substitute for medical advice.\n\nYour situation is indeed complex and puzzling, given your age, overall health, and lack of family history of bone-related issues or epilepsy. The combination of epilepsy, spontaneous compression fractures, and low bone density (osteoporosis) is unusual, especially considering your healthy lifestyle and absence of known risk factors.\n\nSeveral aspects of your case are intriguing:\n\n1. **Epilepsy and bone health**: There might be a link between epilepsy and bone health, as some studies suggest that people with epilepsy may have a higher risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, this is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship and may be related to other factors, such as medication side effects or underlying conditions.\n2. **Spontaneous compression fractures**: These are rare, especially in someone as young as you. The fact that they occurred without trauma and while you were sleeping suggests that there might be an underlying issue with your bone structure or metabolism.\n3. **Low bone density (osteoporosis)**: Your Z-score of -2.4 indicates a significant deviation from the expected bone density for someone of your age and sex. This, combined with the compression fractures, suggests that there may be an underlying condition affecting your bone health.\n4. **Normal lab results and lack of known cause**: This is frustrating, as it's unusual for someone with such significant bone-related issues to have largely normal lab results. This may indicate that the underlying cause is not being captured by standard tests or that there's an unusual or rare condition at play.\n\nSome potential areas to explore further:\n\n1. **Hormonal imbalances**: Although you've seen an endocrinologist, it might be worth re-examining your hormone levels, including testosterone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D, as imbalances can affect bone health.\n2. **Genetic testing**: While you don't have a family history of bone-related issues, genetic mutations can sometimes be responsible for unusual cases of osteoporosis or epilepsy. Genetic testing might help identify potential underlying causes.\n3. **Bone biopsy**: In some cases, a bone biopsy can help diagnose underlying bone disorders or conditions that may not be apparent through standard tests.\n4. **Medication side effects**: Although you've been taking Lexapro for depression, it's possible that this medication could be contributing to your bone health issues. You may want to discuss this with your doctor or a pharmacist.\n5. **Rare conditions**: There are several rare conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, or fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, that could potentially explain your symptoms. These conditions are often difficult to diagnose and may require specialized testing or consultation with experts in the field.\n\nIt's essential to continue working with your healthcare team to investigate the underlying causes of your condition. You may want to consider seeking a second opinion or consulting with a specialist in osteoporosis, bone metabolism, or a geneticist to explore potential genetic or rare conditions.\n\nKeep in mind that it's not uncommon for complex cases like yours to require a prolonged and multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment. Stay proactive, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek additional opinions to ensure you're receiving the best possible care."

        "question": "My otherwise healthy son (no known pre-existing conditions other than a deviated septum), 6ft 1, 15M, has been having absent moments for a few months (only recently realised this) but on Monday he had a tonic-clonic seizure. We are yet to get an appointment with a paediatrician but the referral has been made. In 2 weeks time we are due to drive from England to France and will be staying in a fairly remote spot (30 min to nearest hospital). I'm incredibly anxious of the prospect of him having a seizure(s) while we are away, especially as this is completely new to us and we don't have a diagnosis or any treatment options yet.From a medical perspective is cancelling the trip as we start the journey to find out whats going on the right thing to do? Or am I worrying too much? Your constructive opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I completely understand your anxiety and concern for your son's safety. Given the recent seizure and lack of diagnosis, it's natural to feel apprehensive about traveling to a remote area. Here's a balanced perspective to consider:\n\n**Reasons to consider canceling the trip:**\n\n1. **Uncertainty and unpredictability**: With a new onset of seizures and no diagnosis, it's challenging to predict when the next seizure might occur. Traveling to a remote area may increase the risk of complications or delays in seeking medical attention.\n2. **Limited access to medical care**: Being 30 minutes away from the nearest hospital may pose a problem if your son experiences a seizure or other medical emergency. Timely access to medical care is crucial in such situations.\n3. **Lack of established treatment plan**: Without a diagnosis and treatment plan, you may not have the necessary resources or guidance to manage your son's condition while traveling.\n\n**Reasons to consider proceeding with the trip:**\n\n1. **Seizures can be unpredictable, even with a diagnosis**: Even with a known condition, seizures can be unpredictable. Canceling the trip might not necessarily eliminate the risk of a seizure occurring.\n2. **Your son's overall health**: If your son is otherwise healthy, with no other significant medical conditions, the risk of a severe seizure or complication might be relatively low.\n3. **Quality of life and family time**: Traveling and spending time together can be beneficial for your son's mental and emotional well-being. Canceling the trip might be disappointing for him and your family.\n\n**Constructive advice:**\n\n1. **Consult with a medical professional**: Reach out to your son's GP or a pediatrician (if possible) to discuss your concerns and seek their advice. They may be able to provide guidance on the risks and benefits of traveling or offer alternative solutions.\n2. **Assess the remote location's medical resources**: Research the nearest hospital and medical facilities to determine their capabilities and preparedness for handling seizures or other medical emergencies.\n3. **Prepare for emergencies**: If you decide to proceed with the trip, make sure you have a plan in place for emergency situations, such as:\n\t* Keeping a seizure emergency kit with essential items (e.g., a list of emergency contacts, medication, and a seizure action plan).\n\t* Informing your accommodation provider and local authorities about your son's condition.\n\t* Having a means of rapid communication (e.g., a mobile phone with international coverage) in case of an emergency.\n4. **Consider alternative accommodations**: If you're concerned about the remote location, look into alternative accommodations that are closer to medical facilities or have better access to emergency services.\n5. **Re-evaluate your trip plans**: If you're still anxious about traveling, consider postponing the trip until after your son's appointment with the pediatrician or until you have a better understanding of his condition and treatment plan.\n\nUltimately, the decision to cancel or proceed with the trip depends on your family's individual circumstances and your son's specific needs. It's essential to weigh the potential risks and benefits and consult with medical professionals to make an informed decision."

        "question": "22F, white, 5'6 120lbs. Medical diagnoses: Epilepsy, POTS Medications: Lithium(bipolar), Buspirone(anxiety) lamictal(seizure) I had a urinalysis done on December 22 and it showed 25 rbc/ul. (I hadn\u2019t started lithium yet, this was baseline testing). I assumed the blood in urine was likely a kidney stone or something as there were no signs of infection in my urine or blood and I was having some back pain. Figured it was no big deal. My doctor wanted to ensure the blood in my urine was gone so she ordered a repeat urinalysis yesterday and it came back again showing 25 rbc/ul. (I was not on my period either instance) I can\u2019t get a follow up with my doctor for a couple weeks. What will be the likely next steps? Based on my age I know this is likely benign but I can\u2019t find many reasons for blood in urine other than UTI or kidney stones. I currently have no symptoms. I will attach the results in the comments",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information and possible next steps. It's great that you're taking an proactive approach to your health.\n\nGiven your age and the absence of symptoms, the likelihood of a serious underlying condition is low. However, it's essential to investigate the cause of the persistent hematuria (blood in urine).\n\nConsidering your test results and medical history, here are possible next steps:\n\n1. **Repeat urinalysis with microscopic examination**: Your doctor may order another urinalysis to confirm the presence of blood in your urine and to check for any other abnormalities.\n2. **Imaging studies**: To rule out kidney stones or other possible causes, your doctor may order imaging tests such as:\n\t* Ultrasound: to visualize your kidneys and urinary tract.\n\t* CT scan or MRI: to evaluate your kidneys, ureters, and bladder.\n3. **Nephrology referral**: Your doctor may refer you to a nephrologist (kidney specialist) for further evaluation and guidance.\n4. **Review of medications**: Although you've recently started lithium, it's unlikely to be the cause of hematuria. However, your doctor may review your medications to ensure that none of them could be contributing to the issue.\n5. **Cystoscopy**: In some cases, a cystoscopy (a procedure where a doctor inserts a flexible tube with a camera to visualize the inside of the bladder) may be performed to rule out bladder abnormalities.\n\nIt's essential to note that the presence of 25 RBC/ul is considered microscopic hematuria, which can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Kidney stones\n* Urinary tract infections (although your test results didn't show signs of infection)\n* Kidney disease\n* Bladder or kidney cancer (although rare in someone of your age)\n* Benign conditions like glomerulonephritis or nephritis\n\nWhen you meet with your doctor, be sure to discuss your concerns and ask questions, such as:\n\n* What are the possible causes of the persistent hematuria?\n* What are the next steps in the diagnostic process?\n* Are there any additional tests or exams that need to be done?\n* How will we monitor my condition and determine the best course of action?\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Stay proactive, and I'm sure your doctor will work with you to determine the cause of the hematuria and develop a plan to address it."

        "question": "I'm 19 nonbinary female, 1,53 m high and 66 kg. I got checked for epilepsy when I was 15 (because my aunt has it) but it showed I didn't have any. I was exposed to really bright and fast lights the other day and I started shaking and vomiting, my blood pressure was right like my heart, I felt dizziness, cold and numb. This lasted for like 5 hours I only took some warm tea and ferments (yovis) to help my stomach after all the vomiting. I have problems with my ormons and I take normocis for it. Could it be epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information that might be helpful. Given your symptoms, it's understandable to wonder if you might have epilepsy, especially since you were exposed to triggers like bright and fast lights, which can provoke seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. However, epilepsy is diagnosed based on a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests (like EEG scans) to look for specific patterns of brain activity associated with seizures. Your previous check at 15 might have been negative, but it's possible that conditions can develop over time, or you might have had a condition that wasn't detectable at the time.\n\nThe symptoms you described (shaking, vomiting, dizziness, feeling cold and numb) could be related to a seizure or to other conditions. The fact that these symptoms lasted for about 5 hours and were precipitated by exposure to bright and fast lights suggests a possible photosensitive reaction, but this could also be indicative of other issues such as a migraine, vestibular disorders, or even an anxiety attack, among other possibilities.\n\nGiven your history of being checked for epilepsy and your current symptoms, it would be wise to consult with a healthcare provider. They can assess your overall health, consider your symptoms in the context of your medical history (including the use of Normocis for hormonal issues), and possibly recommend further testing if necessary. It's also good that you took steps to comfort yourself with warm tea and probiotics during the episode.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few general suggestions:\n\n1. **Keep a Symptom Diary:** If you experience any more episodes, write down as many details as you can remember. This can be incredibly helpful for a healthcare provider.\n2. **Avoid Triggers:** If bright and fast lights seem to trigger these episodes, try to avoid them or wear glasses designed to reduce the impact of such stimuli.\n3. **Stay Hydrated:** Especially after an episode of vomiting, it's essential to drink plenty of fluids to replenish lost water and electrolytes.\n4. **Follow Up with Your Healthcare Provider:** Discuss your symptoms and any new developments with your doctor. They can give personalized advice and recommendations for further evaluation or treatment.\n\nRemember, only a healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. This information should not replace professional medical advice."

        "question": "I am a 34f. Height: 5'7\" Weight: Approx. 170lbs. I have a Chiari 1. It has caused a syrinx, roughly the size of a quarter, in the back of my neck. My ears ring 100% of the time, and always have.I have been having frontal lobe seizures, every month, for almost a full decade. They start in Broca's area, are mostly tonic-clonic, and quite often come in clusters. I take meds that help very little, if at all. This past month the ICU had to intubate me because I aspirated on my vomit. I've even ran around outside, naked, once.My husband hasn't been around. He's been in the hospital for his own chronic conditions.I try to keep my head up. Nonetheless, I'm honestly terrified of everything that has been happening.Is my lifespan shortened because of the uncontrolled seizures? Am I a candidate for spinal decompression surgery? Can this surgery possibly control the epilepsy? How much should I worry about SUDEP? What do I do now?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the complexity of the medical conditions described, including Chiari 1 malformation, syrinx, frontal lobe seizures, and the considerations regarding spinal decompression surgery and its potential impact on epilepsy, it's crucial to consult directly with healthcare professionals. They can provide personalized advice and guidance based on the latest medical research and the individual's specific health status.\n\n1. **Lifespan Shortening Due to Uncontrolled Seizures**: Uncontrolled seizures can indeed impact one's quality of life and potentially lifespan due to the risks associated with seizures, such as injuries, status epilepticus, and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Consulting with a neurologist can provide more insight into the specific risks and how to manage them.\n\n2. **Candidate for Spinal Decompression Surgery**: The decision to undergo spinal decompression surgery, particularly for Chiari malformation and syrinx, should be made in consultation with a neurosurgeon. They can evaluate the severity of the condition, the size and location of the syrinx, and the potential benefits and risks of the surgery.\n\n3. **Potential Impact of Surgery on Epilepsy**: The relationship between Chiari malformation, syrinx, and epilepsy is complex. In some cases, surgical intervention for Chiari malformation may improve or even resolve seizures, possibly by reducing the pressure on the brain and spinal cord. However, this outcome is not guaranteed and can vary greatly from person to person. Discussing the potential benefits and risks with both a neurosurgeon and a neurologist is essential.\n\n4. **Concerns About SUDEP**: SUDEP is a significant concern for anyone with uncontrolled seizures. Measures to reduce the risk include optimizing seizure control through medication, considering other treatment options like surgery or devices (e.g., vagus nerve stimulator), and practicing safety measures to reduce injury risk during seizures.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: \n    - **Consult with Specialists**: Schedule appointments with a neurologist to discuss epilepsy management and a neurosurgeon to evaluate the potential for spinal decompression surgery.\n    - **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Ensure a thorough evaluation of your current health status, including the impact of Chiari malformation, syrinx, and epilepsy on your daily life.\n    - **Support System**: Reach out to family, friends, or support groups for help in coping with the emotional and practical challenges of living with chronic conditions.\n    - **Safety Precautions**: Implement safety measures at home to reduce the risk of injury during seizures, such as removing hazardous objects, installing safety rails, and having a seizure emergency plan in place.\n\nGiven the personal and medical challenges faced, maintaining open communication with healthcare providers and seeking support from loved ones or professional counseling services can be beneficial in navigating these complex issues."

        "answer": "I can sense your concern and frustration in trying to understand what's happening with your mom's memory and potential correlation with her epilepsy. I'll provide some general insights, and I'll try to address your questions to the best of my abilities. Please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with your mom's healthcare team for personalized advice.\n\n**Epilepsy and Cognitive Decline**\n\nResearch suggests that people with epilepsy, especially those with a long history of seizures, may be at a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The relationship between epilepsy and cognitive decline is complex, and multiple factors contribute to this risk, including:\n\n1. **Seizure type and frequency**: As you mentioned, focal epilepsy (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) is more strongly associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. However, generalized seizures like tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) can also affect cognitive function, particularly if they are frequent or severe.\n2. **Age of onset**: Epilepsy that begins at a younger age may be more likely to lead to cognitive decline later in life.\n3. **Seizure control**: Poorly controlled seizures can contribute to cognitive decline, as repeated seizures can damage brain tissue and disrupt normal brain function.\n4. **Underlying brain pathology**: Conditions like hippocampal sclerosis, which can cause temporal lobe epilepsy, may also contribute to cognitive decline.\n\n**Temporal Lobe and Grand Mal Seizures**\n\nWhile grand mal seizures are generalized and can involve multiple brain regions, research suggests that they can still affect the temporal lobe, particularly if the seizure activity spreads to this area. However, the extent of temporal lobe involvement and damage may vary depending on individual factors, such as seizure severity and frequency.\n\n**Memory Decline and Lucidity**\n\nIt's difficult to predict exactly how long your mom will remain lucid, as cognitive decline can progress at different rates in different people. Factors like age, overall health, and underlying brain pathology can influence the rate of decline. Generally, cognitive decline can be divided into several stages, including:\n\n1. **Mild cognitive impairment** (MCI): Characterized by noticeable memory problems and other cognitive difficulties, but daily functioning is relatively preserved.\n2. **Dementia**: Significant cognitive decline, including memory loss, confusion, and impaired daily functioning.\n\nThe time between the onset of noticeable memory problems and significant cognitive decline can vary greatly, from a few years to over a decade.\n\n**Support and Comfort**\n\nTo make your mom feel loved and comfortable, consider the following:\n\n1. **Open communication**: Encourage your mom to share her concerns and feelings about her memory problems.\n2. **Emotional support**: Offer reassurance and validation, acknowledging that her experiences are real and frustrating.\n3. **Practical help**: Assist with tasks that may be challenging due to memory problems, such as organizing schedules, medication management, and household chores.\n4. **Cognitive stimulation**: Engage your mom in activities that challenge her mind, such as puzzles, games, or learning new skills.\n5. **Encourage social interaction**: Support social activities and interactions, which can help maintain cognitive function and emotional well-being.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nTo better understand your mom's situation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Consult her neurologist**: Discuss your concerns with her neurologist, who can evaluate her seizure control, medication regimen, and overall brain health.\n2. **Cognitive assessment**: Request a cognitive assessment or neuropsychological evaluation to better understand the extent of her cognitive decline.\n3. **Geriatric care**: Consider consulting a geriatrician, who can assess her overall health, cognitive function, and provide guidance on age-related issues.\n4. **Family support**: Share your concerns with other family members and encourage open discussion to ensure everyone is aware of your mom's needs and can provide support.\n\nRemember, it's essential to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding, avoiding unnecessary alarm or worry. By working together with her healthcare team and providing emotional support, you can help your mom navigate this challenging time."

        "answer": "I'll provide some general insights and possible explanations for your symptoms. Keep in mind that I'm not a substitute for your healthcare providers, and it's essential to discuss your concerns with them for personalized advice.\n\nThe eye shaking (nystagmus) you experience upon waking, particularly after poor sleep or fatigue, could be related to several factors:\n\n1. **Fatigue-induced nystagmus**: As you suggested, muscle strain or fatigue might cause your eyes to shake. When you're exhausted, your eye muscles may have difficulty stabilizing your gaze, leading to nystagmus.\n2. **Vestibular system dysfunction**: The vestibular system, which helps regulate balance and eye movements, can be affected by fatigue, sleep disturbances, or certain medications. This might contribute to nystagmus.\n3. **Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other neurological conditions**: Although some specialists felt you might have MS, while others were unsure, it's possible that your nystagmus could be related to a neurological condition. However, without a definitive MS diagnosis, it's difficult to determine if this is the cause.\n4. **Medication side effects**: Some medications, such as anticonvulsants (e.g., Epitol), can cause nystagmus as a side effect. You may want to review your medication list with your healthcare provider to discuss potential interactions or side effects.\n5. **Other potential causes**: Nystagmus can also be caused by eye strain, migraines, or other conditions. Given your history of chronic migraines, it's possible that your eye shaking might be related to migraine activity or sensitivity.\n\nRegarding your mixed MS test results, it's not uncommon for diagnosis to be challenging, especially if the symptoms are nonspecific or overlap with other conditions. The presence of white spots on your brain (likely referring to white matter lesions) can be seen in various conditions, including MS, migraines, or other inflammatory diseases.\n\nConsidering your complex medical history, it's essential to:\n\n* Discuss your nystagmus symptoms with your neurologist or primary care physician to determine if further evaluation or testing is needed.\n* Review your medication list with your healthcare provider to assess potential side effects or interactions.\n* Continue to monitor your symptoms and report any changes or concerns to your healthcare team.\n* Consider keeping a symptom journal to track your nystagmus episodes, sleep patterns, and any potential triggers or factors that might contribute to your symptoms.\n\nRemember to also prioritize your mental health and continue to address your grief and depression with your healthcare provider and any support systems you have in place.\n\nPlease consult your healthcare providers for personalized guidance and to discuss any further questions or concerns you may have."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can try to offer some general guidance. Given your situation, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms that you believe may not be accurately diagnosed or managed by your current neurologist. The description of your \"head jerks\" and the associated sensations could be indicative of several conditions, including but not limited to seizure activity, as you've mentioned, or other neurological issues. The fact that these symptoms worsen when you're off your medications and have been exacerbated by recent lack of sleep and illness suggests there could be a significant link between these factors and your neurological health.\n\nGiven that you feel your neurologist is not listening to your concerns, it may be beneficial to discuss your symptoms and your feelings about your current diagnosis and treatment with your GP. Your GP can offer a fresh perspective, potentially refer you to a different specialist if needed, and help adjust your current medication regimen if appropriate. It's also possible that your GP could recommend additional diagnostic tests to further investigate the nature of your symptoms.\n\nHere are some steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Keep a Symptom Diary:** Before your GP appointment, start documenting when these episodes occur, any triggers you notice, and how you feel before, during, and after each episode. This can provide valuable information for your GP.\n\n2. **Prepare for Your GP Appointment:** Write down all your concerns, the medications you're currently taking, and why you feel your neurologist isn't listening to you. Be as detailed as possible about your symptoms and your medical history.\n\n3. **Request a Second Opinion:** Ask your GP if they can refer you to a different neurologist for a second opinion. Sometimes, a fresh perspective can be incredibly beneficial.\n\n4. **Discuss Adjusting Your Medication:** If you feel that your current medication regimen is not adequately managing your symptoms, discuss this with your GP. They can help you decide if an adjustment is necessary or if additional medications might be beneficial.\n\n5. **Explore Other Potential Causes:** There could be other reasons for your symptoms that haven't been considered. Be open to the possibility of other conditions and ask your GP about the potential for further testing or evaluation.\n\n6. **Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Given your mention of Bipolar and OCD, CBT can be very helpful in managing symptoms of these conditions and might also offer some strategies for dealing with the anxiety or discomfort associated with your physical symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's your right as a patient to seek a second opinion and to advocate for yourself. Don't hesitate to push for the care and attention you feel you need. Your health and well-being are paramount, and there are healthcare professionals who will listen and work with you to find the best course of action."

I am in good health aside from the growing list of neurological issues I\u2019ve been having after finding a raging enlarged right hilar lymph node this past February. Needle biopsy was negative.I am hanging out on the hospital bed, chillaxing watching tv\u2026 and after a few minutes of some kinda medium-mild pain at the top of my spine/base of skull, the following sequence lasted about 2-3 min start to finish, but repeated every few minutes for about an hour:-Right eye involuntarily closes/flutters (~30 seconds) immediately followed by\u2026-Strange \u2018out of body/near syncope/like the power is flickering in my brain\u2019 feeling, strong for ~30 seconds, then continues in very brief intermittent waves, immediately followed by\u2026-right leg spasms/shakes/jerks around for ~30 seconds, immediately followed by\u2026-both hands very tingly\u2026.And once the tingling fully fades, I feel normal for not very many minutes and the cycle repeats.I could talk/interact during all this except the mini out of body type feeling times. After several repetitions, I began to have right sided facial twitching/numbness along with the eye closing. My speech was affected, I guess because of numbness? Also, I could not lift up either leg as the nurse pressed down until the full end of the cycle. All steps of the cycle grew longer and more intense as the hour stretched on, then resolved somewhat suddenly.Right as all this was wrapping up, the attending neurologist stepped in and without asking any questions or seeing any of this himself, told me not to worry, everything was fine, the eeg looked normal, and started asking if I was anxious or upset about anything. I said no, but what did he think all that was. He says the eeg was normal, therefore it was a psychogenic seizure, not a real one, and I should be happy. I told him that it didn\u2019t really seem like any kind of seizure I\u2019ve ever experienced/heard about, epileptic or not, it seemed like something else entirely and maybe we should try to figure out what? Then he said something about I should mention it to the daytime Dr tomorrow and maybe they could do something on an outpatient basis, but don\u2019t bother him again tonight and if I need anything else, like anxiety medication, ask the nurse. So uh\u2026 yeah.Thoughts? Feelings? I briefly caught part of it on video, but have no idea how to post that here.I greatly appreciate any input.",

        "answer": "I'm glad you shared your experience with me. I'll provide an objective and neutral analysis of what you've described. Please note that I'm not a medical professional, and my response should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nThe sequence of events you described is quite complex and involves multiple neurological symptoms, including:\n\n1. **Eye and facial symptoms**: Involuntary eye closure, fluttering, and later, right-sided facial twitching and numbness.\n2. **Near-syncope/out-of-body experience**: A feeling of disconnection or \"flickering\" in your brain, which may be related to altered consciousness or a sensation of impending loss of consciousness.\n3. **Motor symptoms**: Right leg spasms, shaking, and jerking, as well as weakness or inability to lift your legs.\n4. **Sensory symptoms**: Tingling sensations in both hands.\n5. **Speech difficulties**: Possibly related to facial numbness or weakness.\n\nThe cyclical nature of these events, with each episode lasting around 2-3 minutes and repeating every few minutes for about an hour, is unusual and suggests a potentially complex underlying mechanism.\n\nGiven your recent medical history, including the discovery of an enlarged right hilar lymph node and a negative needle biopsy, it's essential to consider potential connections between your neurological symptoms and the underlying cause of the lymph node enlargement.\n\nThe neurologist's response, attributing your experience to a psychogenic seizure without directly observing the events or considering alternative explanations, raises concerns. While psychogenic seizures can occur, the complexities of your symptoms and the absence of a clear seizure pattern on EEG do not necessarily support this diagnosis.\n\nYour intuition that this might be \"something else entirely\" is valid, and it's essential to advocate for a more thorough investigation into the underlying causes of your symptoms. The following steps may be helpful:\n\n1. **Request a more detailed evaluation**: Ask your doctor to reconsider the possibility of an underlying neurological condition that may not be related to epilepsy or psychogenic seizures.\n2. **Additional testing**: Consider requesting further investigations, such as:\n\t* Advanced imaging studies (e.g., MRI, CT scans) to rule out structural abnormalities or other conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\t* Electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies (NCS) to assess muscle and nerve function.\n\t* Blood tests to check for inflammatory, autoimmune, or infectious conditions that may be relevant to your symptoms.\n3. **Seek a second opinion**: If possible, consult with another neurologist or a specialist in a relevant field (e.g., neuromuscular medicine, neuroimmunology) to gain a fresh perspective on your case.\n4. **Keep a symptom diary**: Documenting the frequency, duration, and characteristics of your episodes can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for your healthcare team.\n\nPlease remember that it's essential to prioritize your health and advocate for a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying causes of your symptoms.\n\nIf you're comfortable sharing, I'd be happy to help you explore potential next steps and provide general information on the conditions that might be relevant to your symptoms."

        "question": "We have been working with a neurologist about my son. He\u2019s had tremors since he was a baby, but we were always told he would grow out of them. He did have an actual seizure once, but after a 4 hour EEG, they said his brain activity did not look like epilepsy. Lately, he has been closing his eyes and shaking his head, almost like he ate something super sour. Is that normal? What could it be? Teething? Mini seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're seeking medical attention for your son's symptoms! The behaviors you're describing, such as tremors, closing his eyes, and shaking his head, can be concerning and may have various possible explanations. While I'm not a medical professional, I'll provide some general insights to help you better understand what might be going on.\n\n**Tremors:**\nTremors in babies and children can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. **Benign essential tremor**: A common, harmless condition that may be inherited.\n2. **Developmental tremors**: Some children may experience tremors during developmental stages, which often resolve on their own.\n3. **Neurological conditions**: Certain conditions, such as cerebral palsy, dystonia, or other movement disorders, can cause tremors.\n\n**Closing eyes and shaking head:**\nThis behavior could be related to:\n\n1. **Sensory overload**: Some children may exhibit this behavior in response to overwhelming sensory stimuli, such as loud noises or bright lights.\n2. **Gastrointestinal issues**: Reflux, constipation, or other digestive problems might cause discomfort, leading to this behavior.\n3. **Teething**: While teething can cause discomfort, it's unlikely to be the primary cause of this specific behavior.\n4. **Seizure activity**: As you mentioned, it's possible that this behavior could be a type of seizure, such as a **focal seizure** or ** absence seizure**.\n\n**Mini seizure:**\nIt's essential to discuss the possibility of seizure activity with your neurologist. Even if the EEG didn't show typical epilepsy patterns, it's possible that your son might be experiencing **subclinical seizures** or **epileptiform activity** that aren't detectable on a standard EEG.\n\n**Next steps:**\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with your neurologist to discuss these new symptoms in detail. Provide as much information as possible, including:\n\n* Frequency and duration of the episodes\n* Any triggers or patterns you've noticed\n* Changes in behavior, appetite, or sleep patterns\n* Any other symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, or vomiting\n\nYour neurologist may recommend additional testing, such as:\n\n* **Video EEG monitoring**: To capture the behavior and corresponding brain activity\n* **MRI or CT scan**: To rule out structural abnormalities in the brain\n* **Blood tests**: To check for underlying metabolic or genetic conditions\n\nIn the meantime, keep a seizure diary or log to track the episodes, including the date, time, duration, and any potential triggers. This will help your neurologist better understand the patterns and make a more informed diagnosis.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your child's health. Discuss your concerns with your neurologist, and work together to determine the underlying cause of your son's symptoms."

        "question": "Hi everyone. I'm a male in my 30's, was directed by a neurologist to take brain EEG. After looking at the test results my doc told me to speak with an epilepsy specialist, which I m going to next month. This got me worried, so I'd like to ask you to help me interpret the EEG because my doc refused to comment on it before I speak with someone specializing in epilepsy...My symptoms are episodic fatigue, feeling disoriented, concentration and thinking difficulty, sometimes trembling/shivering, a general feeling that's hard to describe but I'd say it's feeling very weird... I can't put it in words... I was never diagnosed with epilepsy before. Please see the EEG result below. I translated it into English with Google Translate as I'm not from an English speaking country. I would appreciate any help. Examination conditions: 19 (9) convexity electrodes, 24-channel PL-EEG bi- and monopolar, at rest, with HV and under flickering light In peace: Above the posterior regions of the brain there is a moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity with individual, slower, interrupting waves and, in some cases, faster-frequency \u00df-waves, which spreads to the centroparietal and temporal areas and shows incomplete reactivity to attempts to open and close eyelids. Background activity predominates over central and temporal brain areas, frontal low voltage f3 activity. In addition, discontinuous dysrhythmias are displayed regionally left temporal mid-frontotemporal as well as over the front brain regions (maximum T3-F7, F3-FP1) as well as here again and again isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes. Under flickering light: No activation signs. Under hyperventilation: Slight activation of the regional changes described.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to help you understand your EEG results, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and only a qualified specialist can provide a definitive interpretation and diagnosis.\n\nThe EEG report you provided appears to be a standard format, and I'll break it down into sections to help you understand the findings.\n\n**Examination conditions:**\nThe EEG was recorded using 19 convexity electrodes, which is a standard setup. The recording was done in a 24-channel PL-EEG system, which allows for both bipolar and monopolar recordings. The test was conducted at rest, with hyperventilation (HV), and under flickering light.\n\n**Findings at rest:**\nThe report mentions a \"moderately pronounced, amplitude-unstable, around 10 c/s background activity\" in the posterior regions of the brain. This suggests that the background brain activity is not entirely normal, with some irregularities in amplitude (a measure of the strength of the signal) and frequency (around 10 Hz, which is within the alpha frequency band).\n\nThe background activity spreads to other areas, including the centroparietal and temporal regions, and shows \"incomplete reactivity\" to attempts to open and close eyelids. This might indicate some abnormalities in the way the brain responds to external stimuli.\n\nThe report also mentions \"discontinuous dysrhythmias\" in specific regions, including the left temporal and mid-frontotemporal areas, as well as the frontal regions. Dysrhythmias refer to abnormal rhythmic patterns in the brain activity. The presence of \"isolated rudimentary sharp wave complexes\" might be of concern, as sharp waves can be indicative of epileptiform activity (although this is not necessarily the case here).\n\n**Findings under hyperventilation:**\nHyperventilation is a technique used to activate potential abnormalities in the brain. In your case, the report mentions \"slight activation of the regional changes described,\" which might suggest that the abnormalities seen at rest are more pronounced under hyperventilation.\n\n**Findings under flickering light:**\nThe report states that there are \"no activation signs\" under flickering light, which means that the flickering light did not trigger any notable changes in the brain activity.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nBased on the report, it appears that your EEG shows some abnormalities in the background brain activity, including irregularities in amplitude and frequency, as well as discontinuous dysrhythmias in specific regions. The presence of sharp wave complexes, isolated or not, can be a concern, but it's essential to consider the entire clinical context and other diagnostic findings.\n\nIt's not possible to determine with certainty whether these findings are indicative of epilepsy or another condition without a thorough evaluation by a qualified specialist, such as an epileptologist. The symptoms you described, such as episodic fatigue, disorientation, concentration difficulties, and trembling, could be related to various conditions, including epilepsy, but a definitive diagnosis requires a comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Next steps:**\nIt's excellent that you have an appointment with an epilepsy specialist next month. They will be able to review your EEG results, medical history, and symptoms in detail, and provide a more informed interpretation and potential diagnosis. Be sure to ask questions and discuss your concerns with the specialist to ensure you understand their findings and any recommended course of action.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a professional medical opinion, and only a qualified specialist can provide a definitive diagnosis and guidance. I hope this helps you understand your EEG results better, and I wish you the best for your upcoming appointment."

        "question": "Hi all and thank you in advance to any physicians/pharmacists/other medical professionals who are able to provide insight. And thank you to any non-clinicians who may be able to speak on their personal experience. Sorry this is so long!!! I have chronic primary insomnia (13ish years now), GAD, ADHD, and depression (generally mild but when it escalates it quite literally paralyzes me), no other chronic issues, no h/o SI, most recent BP was 121/80, HR runs high (true resting rate is normal but during the day it's usually 80-100 bpm) and easily increases to 120 or higher probably due to stimulants, caffeine, my conditions, and my baseline level of stress. I\u2019m (23F) 5\u20194, around +/-140 lbs, caucasian, minimal EtOH, previously daily marijuana use but now only occasional, self-grown shrooms 3-4x annually if not less. I\u2019m pre-med with 1000s of hours of clinical experience and several times I have correctly diagnosed myself and others- by others I mean I predicted their diagnosis upon presentation and was correct. I\u2019m extremely medically competent for someone who will only start med school this fall, and I\u2019ve completed an SMP which required med school classes at the associated institution. I'm well aware I'm not a licensed medical professional yet and don't act like one in reality, but I feel this info is pertinent. My psychiatrist knows about my relevant medical experience and commitment to the profession and has always treated me as an equal if not a sort of mentee. Our relationship is very casual, probably because of my background and self-awareness, and she trusts me when I research meds I feel would be most compatible with my needs. She provides input as necessary, has her own suggestions, and ultimately she\u2019s the one who makes the official diagnosis, however I do have a lot of autonomy under her care. Ex: dx of depression, recommended Lexapro or something and I countered with Wellbutrin and she agreed. Same with my switch from Ritalin (ineffective for me) to Adderall. I\u2019ve been seeing her for close to 10 years and she\u2019s a bit of a hippy and likely went to med school in the 70s or 80s. She attended an extremely prestigious med school and residency, so I know at least her qualifications are valid. Primary complaint: I\u2019ve tried several meds for my insomnia and eventually landed on Trazodone 100 mg nightly which I\u2019ve taken for about 6-7 years without issue. For my GAD, I initially took Ativan which didn\u2019t work at the 1 mg dose and made me feel out-of-body at the 2 mg dose. My dad takes Klonopin so my doc agreed it was a good option to try and it definitely works. My insomnia is extremely stubborn and Trazodone alone (regardless of dose) is occasionally not enough so when I know I won\u2019t fall asleep, I take 1 mg Klonopin to supplement which knocks me out. Additionally, I take Adderall 30 mg usually daily but I\u2019m prescribed enough for BID. I also take Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. My medschedule is: -morning: alarm for 7 AM to take one dose Adderall and Wellbutrin and fall back asleep until they kick in/I have to get up -afternoon: occasional additional Adderall or Klonopin PRN -night: Trazodone 30 min-hour before bed, Klonopin PRN if I can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour or more Based on the drug interaction tracker, there is a serious interaction between Trazodone/Wellbutrin AND Trazodone/Adderall with other moderate interactions between literally everything else. My main concern is the lowered seizure threshold, which depending on the interaction tracker, can occur for 1+ interactions. I don't have a h/o seizures nor does anyone in my family. I do occasionally experience what I believe is orthostatic hypotension when I get up from bed and walk to the bathroom, though this could also be due to dehydration and/or suppressed appetite. I don't mind any of the symptoms, they're definitely manageable enough for me, I'm just concerned about the seizure risk especially because my doc literally told me all of the meds I'm on are safe enough to double the dose if needed....",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to provide you with a thorough and informed response.\n\nFirst, kudos to you for being proactive and taking charge of your medical care. Your background in pre-med and clinical experience is impressive, and it's great that you have a good relationship with your psychiatrist.\n\nNow, let's dive into your concerns. You're correct that there are potential interactions between the medications you're taking, particularly with regards to the lowered seizure threshold. I'll break down the relevant interactions:\n\n1. **Trazodone + Wellbutrin**: This combination can increase the risk of seizures due to the potential for additive serotonergic effects (Trazodone is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor, while Wellbutrin is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor). The risk is still relatively low, but it's essential to monitor for any signs of seizures or changes in your condition.\n2. **Trazodone + Adderall**: This combination can also increase the risk of seizures, particularly at high doses of Adderall. Amphetamines like Adderall can lower the seizure threshold, and combining them with Trazodone may further increase this risk.\n3. **Klonopin + other medications**: Klonopin can interact with other medications, including Adderall and Wellbutrin, to increase the risk of adverse effects such as sedation, respiratory depression, and potentially seizures.\n\nGiven your concerns, it's essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits of your current medication regimen with your psychiatrist. While you don't have a history of seizures, it's crucial to monitor for any signs of increased risk, such as:\n\n* Changes in your mood, cognitive function, or behavior\n* Increased anxiety or agitation\n* Unusual sensations, such as tingling, numbness, or tremors\n* Any new or worsening symptoms\n\nTo mitigate the potential risks, you may want to consider the following:\n\n* Regularly review your medication list with your psychiatrist to ensure that the benefits of each medication outweigh the potential risks.\n* Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and any other relevant vital signs regularly.\n* Keep a seizure diary or log to track any potential signs of increased risk.\n* Discuss alternative medication options with your psychiatrist, such as adjusting doses or switching to different medications with a lower risk profile.\n\nRegarding your orthostatic hypotension symptoms, it's possible that dehydration, suppressed appetite, or other factors may be contributing to these episodes. Make sure to stay hydrated, eat regular meals, and discuss any concerns with your psychiatrist.\n\nLastly, while your psychiatrist may have mentioned that it's safe to double the dose of your medications if needed, it's essential to prioritize caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits of any dose adjustments.\n\nI hope this information helps you have a more informed discussion with your psychiatrist. Remember to always prioritize your health and safety, and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or consult with other medical professionals if you have any concerns."

I ran into a game that gave a warning for Photosensitive epilepsy for its intense flashing however I play many games that have intense flashing but haven't had a episode. I am currently on 250MG of LamoTRIgine and I haven't had an episode since iv started the medication. My question is, is it okay to play that game that gives the warning although I play games similar to it and have no side effct.Im 27 and Im a male. I weigh about 290",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that may help. It's great to hear that you've been managing your condition well with medication and haven't had an episode since starting Lamotrigine.\r\n\r\nPhotosensitive epilepsy is a type of epilepsy that's triggered by visual stimuli, such as flashing lights or patterns. The warning on the game you're interested in playing is likely due to the intense flashing effects, which could potentially trigger a seizure in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\r\n\r\nAlthough you've played games with similar intense flashing effects without issues, it's essential to exercise caution. Here are a few factors to consider:\r\n\r\n1. **Individual tolerance**: Everyone's sensitivity to visual triggers is different. Just because you've played similar games without issues doesn't mean you're completely immune to the effects of this particular game.\r\n2. **Game-specific triggers**: The game you're interested in playing may have specific visual effects or patterns that are more likely to trigger a seizure, even if you've played other games with similar effects.\r\n3. **Medication and dosage**: While you're on a stable dose of Lamotrigine, it's crucial to remember that medication can only reduce the likelihood of seizures, not eliminate the risk entirely.\r\n4. **Personal health and well-being**: As you mentioned, you're 27, male, and weigh 290 pounds. While these factors don't directly impact your seizure risk, it's essential to consider your overall health and well-being when engaging in activities that may potentially trigger a seizure.\r\n\r\nTo minimize potential risks, you could consider the following:\r\n\r\n1. **Consult your doctor or neurologist**: Discuss your plans to play the game with your doctor or neurologist, and ask for their advice. They can help you assess the potential risks and provide guidance on how to proceed.\r\n2. **Start with caution**: If you decide to play the game, start with short sessions and monitor your body![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22100%22%20height=%22100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) for any signs of discomfort or seizure activity.\r\n3. **Be aware of your surroundings**: Make sure you're playing in a safe environment, with a trusted person nearby who can help if needed.\r\n4. **Consider alternatives**: If you're unsure about playing the game, you could look into alternative games that don't carry the same warnings or risks.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. If you're unsure or uncomfortable, it's best to prioritize your safety and well-being."

        "question": "18, male, white, 5'11, 81kg, drink occasionally, smoke cigarettes daily, occasional recreational drug use (usually cannabis). Officially diagnosed with ASD and have motor tics. I've noticed \"blanking out\" spells where i stare off and become completely unresponsive followed by arm and neck twitching and jerking. This most often happens when i'm drinking or when my sleep schedule becomes unhealthy. The first instances of this i can think of must've been a couple years ago and it seems to have been transient since then, but i've noticed it a few times in the past couple months. What especially alarms me is that i know my cousin (blood-related) has had a few instances of grande-mal seizures after drinking, specifically on an empty stomach. I remain conscious during these spells and still aware of my surroundings, albeit less so than typically, however i find that i cannot respond to anything that goes on around me. The twitching and jerking does not last very long (i would say 2 seconds or so). Could it be epilepsy? Am i overthinking?",

        "question": " I am 19F, 120 pounds. Diagnosed anxiety and depression hyperhidrosis 4 years ago. On 200 mg of bupropion twice a day for 4 years now. Started 5 mg of buspirone twice a day in April 2023. I take 25-75 mg of hydroxyzine as needed, so not always daily. 2 mg glycopporolate for the hyperhidrosis. I use marijuana from a licensed dispensary recreationally 4x a week and have for the last year.I believe I had my first potential seizure on August 5th. I was laying in bed, and all of sudden felt extremely heavy. My head felt the heaviest, and my body felt like it was being pulled/melting into my bed. I closed my eyes as if about to fall asleep and felt an electric shock wave going through my head, almost heard the noise of electricity. I think it lasted around 30 seconds. I was fully conscious during it, but felt as if I could not move or speak unless I put tremendous effort into it. Afterwards I felt fine, just a little confused and tired, but I went to work like normal and had a fine shift.Several days later, something similar but different happened. I was sitting in a parking lot with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I felt extreme anger out of nowhere, like I wanted to yell at her which I have never felt before and it was completely unprompted. I was quiet and staring out the window and she asked me if I was ok I just said yes. She then tells me I was just staring at my leg for several minutes. I remember just staring at my leg thinking it looked weird, but I was fully conscious. She was asking me questions and I could respond but it took me much longer and much more effort and I couldn\u2019t say what I wanted to say, more like just a few word answers. It ended pretty abruptly and then I was fine, but again just a little bit confused and tired. My girlfriend has non epileptic seizures (diagnosed) and she thinks I\u2019m having seizures based on what she\u2019s seen and observed and what I\u2019ve told her, but I\u2019m not so sure.  A couple days after that, it happened again. Me and my girlfriend were eating lunch in a restaurant and I started to feel \u201cweird\u201d. I got up went to the bathroom and threw up, and just really felt like I needed to lay down so I asked her to pack our food up and that I\u2019m going to lay in the backseat. Afterwards, she told me I was speaking very slowly when I asked her to pack the food up. I was laying in the backseat and began to have repeated images from my childhood play like movies in my brain. I kept seeing the Lincoln logs I used to play with as a kid, specifically at my grandparents cabin. I saw the fold out table I would sit at and play with them. I just kept seeing them being built up over and over again, and had some other disorganized thoughts. I was conscious and could still speak, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what Lincoln logs were but that was all I said for several minutes. This one lasted the longest, but it\u2019s hard to separate the potential actual seizure versus the before and after tiredness/confusion.There were a few other similar episodes, typically after I eat something fatty/sugary, or am really tired, but those are the only patterns I can detect. I worry that I\u2019m making this up for attention, that it\u2019s just me zoning out really heavily and I just want it to be seizures for attention.Each one is a little bit different, but I get a similar enough feeling beforehand that\u2019s usually nausea, anxiety and/or anger, rising feeling in my chest, really tired/spaced out, pre odd and disorganized thoughts, like just very random thoughts in the parking lot I just started thinking about mannequin army running out of the building and dancing I kept thinking about dancing mannequins. I also get droopy eyelids, my eyes feel heavy and when I start to feel this way I take selfies and you can see my eyelids drooping and look different from normal.I do often get headaches, mild migraines/silent migraines very often, multiple times a week. Is it a possibility this is just migraine aura, or should I see a doctor to be evaluated for focal seizures? Is it possible to fake this or make it up? Is there any other questions you need me to answer to give advice, or things I should pay attention to?I also have occasional dizziness, sometimes pretty intense that I might lose my balance a little and need to grab onto things, or sit down, but I don\u2019t pass out. I used to be a runner, this time last year I could run 6 miles now I can barely do 1. I\u2019ve also lost close to 20 pounds in the last year as well.Edit: forgot to mention, had a CBC panel in mid august and showed no abnormalities other than a mild vitamin D ",

        "answer": "I'll provide you with some insights and suggestions based on the information you've shared. However, please note that only a qualified medical professional can provide a definitive diagnosis and guidance.\n\n**Migraine aura vs. focal seizures:**\nIt's possible that your experiences could be related to migraine aura, especially given your history of mild migraines/silent migraines. Migraine aura can manifest as a range of symptoms, including visual disturbances, sensory changes, and even episodes of confusion or altered consciousness. However, the characteristics you've described, such as the \"electric shock wave\" sensations, muscle heaviness, and difficulty speaking, are more suggestive of focal seizures.\n\n**Focal seizures:**\nYour girlfriend's observation of your behavior, particularly the episodes where you're unresponsive or slow to respond, and the post-episode fatigue and confusion, are concerning for focal seizures. Focal seizures can present with a range of symptoms, including altered consciousness, automatisms (repetitive behaviors), and post-ictal confusion.\n\n**Making it up for attention:**\nIt's unlikely that you're intentionally fabricating these episodes for attention. Your descriptions are detailed and consistent, and you've reported a range of symptoms that are not typical of factitious disorder (also known as Munchausen syndrome). Factitious disorder typically involves a clear motivation for attention-seeking behavior, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\n**Other possible explanations:**\nOther potential causes for your symptoms could include:\n\n1. **Medication side effects:** Bupropion, buspirone, and hydroxyzine can all have side effects that might contribute to your symptoms. However, it's unlikely that these medications alone would cause the specific combination of symptoms you're experiencing.\n2. **Marijuana use:** While you've been using marijuana recreationally for a year, it's possible that you're experiencing some unforeseen effects, particularly given your other medications and medical history.\n3. **Underlying medical conditions:** Your weight loss, dizziness, and loss of endurance (e.g., reduced running ability) could be indicative of an underlying medical condition, such as anemia, hypothyroidism, or a sleep disorder.\n\n**Next steps:**\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action. I recommend:\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician** to discuss your symptoms, medication regimen, and medical history.\n2. **Request a referral to a neurologist** to rule out focal seizures, migraines, or other conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n3. **Keep a symptom journal** to track your episodes, including the time of day, any potential triggers, and the duration of each episode.\n4. **Consider an EEG (electroencephalogram)** to evaluate your brain activity and help diagnose or rule out seizures.\n\n**Additional questions:**\nTo better understand your situation, please consider the following questions:\n\n1. Have you experienced any head trauma or concussions in the past?\n2. Do you have a family history of seizures, migraines, or other neurological conditions?\n3. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, appetite, or energy levels over the past year?\n4. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness, that you haven't mentioned?\n\nBy seeking medical attention and keeping a thorough record of your symptoms, you'll be able to work with your healthcare team to determine the underlying cause of your experiences and develop an effective treatment plan."

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed with EA2 after an unexpected hospital stay. Of course I have been researching the condition, and came across 4-AP. I currently take Diamox(500 mg BID) and prednisone(5 mg), which help, but if I begin to have an episode I have to take more and more until it finally stops. My current neurologist won\u2019t really discuss the medication with me, which I was rather surprised by. He has really been pushing for me to come off of the prednisone, even though it is the only thing that really helps me. He wants me to go to a movement clinic first, but the only local one doesn\u2019t take my insurance. Even if I get a PA from my insurance, there is no telling how long it will take before I can get an appointment after. I was really hoping I could get on the 4-AP and come off of the prednisone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm troubled to hear about your situation with EA2 and the challenges you're facing with your current treatment regimen. It's understandable that you're looking into alternative options like 4-AP, especially given your concerns about the long-term use of prednisone. \n\n4-AP (4-aminopyridine) is indeed a medication that has been used for the treatment of certain symptoms associated with EA2, as it can help in managing ataxia and other neurological symptoms. However, it's important to approach any medication change with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Given your neurologist's reluctance to discuss 4-AP with you, it might be beneficial to seek a second opinion from another neurologist who specializes in ataxia or movement disorders. They can provide a more detailed evaluation of whether 4-AP could be a suitable option for you and help you navigate the process of transitioning from your current medications.\n\nRegarding your insurance issues and access to a movement clinic, it might be helpful to contact your insurance provider directly to understand their process for approving visits to specialist clinics and to inquire about any potential alternatives that might be covered. Sometimes, persistence and advocating for yourself can lead to finding solutions that weren't initially apparent.\n\nAdditionally, reaching out to patient advocacy groups for EA2 or ataxia can provide valuable support and potentially connect you with resources or clinicians who have experience with your condition and the medications you're inquiring about.\n\nRemember, while it's crucial to follow medical advice, it's also important to be an advocate for your own health. Continuing to push for a treatment plan that you're comfortable with and that effectively manages your symptoms is key. \n\nPlease take care and I hope you find a path forward that improves your health and well-being."

        "question": "Few nights ago I woke up around 4 am, it happens often to me. What was weird was my consciousness. I was trying to go back to sleep but I had an instinct reaction like when you are drowing that I have to not go back to sleep.As I was getting more awake something felt odd. It was impossible to have a complex thought, thinking was liking trying to hold water with one hand. I was feeling like my ability to think was malfunctioning, like glitching. I was like anable to wake myself more than a kind of pure reaction state.I got up, walked to the living room, trying to wake myself up, nothing. It is hard to describe, it was like my thoughts were erasing as proceeded. Like I was writing on burning paper.I tried to go back to bed thinking going back to sleep would help. I hold my wife to help me calming as I was trying to fall asleep again.The instinct kicks harder, it was like if I was keep going sleeping I would lose that ability to think, my thoughts were getting simplier and simplier, then I noticed that the voice most people hear as they think was completly silent.. a deafning silent.I feel really weird I try to relax, to clear my thinking, I go again in the living room to keep my eyes open, it feels likes my thoughts are not recognized as mine anymore, I do not control my thinking, I lost the ability to, things get chaotic, confused. I try to remind myself memories to keep a thread to reality, it helps. I succeed to get more complex thoughts, I realise that emotions are back as I didn't noticed I kinda lost it for a moment, was it the panic, the fight or flee mode ? I feel flooded by these emotions, I cry.Then it took like 15 minutes to come back to normal, I am in a very confused state and go back to sleep.Any idea what was that ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What a fascinating and unsettling experience you've described! I'll try to help you make sense of it, but keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's always best to consult with a doctor or a neurologist if you're concerned about your well-being.\n\nThat being said, your experience seems to share some similarities with certain neurological or psychological phenomena. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Sleep paralysis with hallucinations**: You experienced a strange, unsettling feeling, and your thinking was impaired, which could be related to sleep paralysis. However, your ability to get up and walk to the living room suggests that you weren't fully paralyzed.\n2. **Transient global amnesia**: This condition is characterized by a sudden, temporary inability to form new memories, often accompanied by confusion and disorientation. Your experience of trying to hold onto thoughts and memories, but feeling like they were \"erasing,\" might be similar to what people with transient global amnesia report.\n3. **Hypnagogic state**: The hypnagogic state is a transitional phase between wakefulness and sleep, characterized by altered consciousness, vivid imagery, and impaired critical thinking. Your description of trying to think, but feeling like your thoughts were \"glitching\" or \"erasing,\" might be related to this state.\n4. **Panic attack or anxiety episode**: The intense emotional response you experienced, including crying, could be indicative of a panic attack or anxiety episode. The feeling of losing control over your thoughts and emotions is common in these situations.\n5. **Sleep inertia**: Waking up during a light sleep phase, especially after a short sleep period, can lead to sleep inertia, which is characterized by grogginess, disorientation, and impaired cognitive function. This might contribute to the feeling of being in a \"pure reaction state\" and struggling to think clearly.\n6. **Neurotransmitter imbalance or fluctuation**: Certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, or acetylcholine, play important roles in regulating thinking, mood, and cognitive function. Imbalances or fluctuations in these neurotransmitters could potentially contribute to the unusual experience you had.\n\nIt's essential to note that these possibilities are speculative and might not fully explain your experience. If you're concerned about your mental or neurological health, I recommend consulting a medical professional for a thorough evaluation and guidance.\n\nIn the meantime, consider the following:\n\n* Keep a sleep diary to track your sleep patterns and any similar episodes.\n* Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage stress and anxiety.\n* Engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle to promote overall well-being.\n* If you experience similar episodes in the future, try to remain calm and focus on your breath or a simple activity to help ground yourself.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss or if you have any further questions!"

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing these distressing and exhausting symptoms. It's understandable that you're concerned and seeking help. I'll try to provide some insights and potential explanations, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult a doctor or a specialist for a proper diagnosis and guidance.\n\n**Sleep Paralysis:**\nYour symptoms, such as feeling paralyzed, unable to move, and experiencing hallucinations (e.g., hearing noises), are consistent with sleep paralysis. This condition is relatively common, especially in people with a history of sleep disruptions, stress, and certain mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Sleep paralysis can occur when your body is in a state of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but your brain is partially awake, leading to a sense of paralysis and immobility.\n\n**Exploding Head Syndrome:**\nThe \"crazy noises\" you mentioned, also known as exploding head syndrome, is a phenomenon where you hear loud, alarming sounds, often when falling asleep or waking up. This can be a symptom of sleep paralysis or a separate condition.\n\n**Magnetic sensation:**\nThe feeling of a magnet preventing you from moving your head or body is a common description of sleep paralysis. It's as if your brain is sending signals to your body, but your muscles are not responding.\n\n**Memory loss:**\nShort-term memory loss can be related to various factors, including sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, or other underlying medical conditions. While epilepsy can cause memory problems, it's essential to note that you haven't mentioned any other symptoms commonly associated with epilepsy, such as seizures or convulsions.\n\n**Other potential factors:**\nConsidering your occasional drinking and smoking, it's possible that these habits might be contributing to your sleep disturbances.

        "question": "Hey everyone,So my epilepsy meds were changed a few months ago mainly due to my LFT showing very high levels but also because the drug (Tegretol) was no longer working to its potential. So as of now I'm on Keppra and Topamax which means all my AED drugs filter through the Kidneys. Originally I was told I wouldn't need blood tests but at my latest appointment, I was told they definitely will do them. I tried to ask the Specist and NP this in the appointment and they wouldn't really tell me whether there not sure at the moment I don't know. Originally I was getting LFT, CBC or (FBC) and therapeutic drug levels test.My question is with blood testing now likely to continue is it likely they will continue with the LFT and just add on a renal panel? How would this likely play out?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's understandable that you're seeking clarity on the blood testing regimen now that you're on Keppra and Topamax, both of which are primarily excreted through the kidneys. Given the change in medication and the potential impact on your kidneys, it's reasonable that your healthcare providers might adjust the monitoring strategy. Here's a general overview of what might happen:\n\n1. **Continuation of LFT (Liver Function Tests)**: Despite the change in medication, your healthcare providers might still choose to monitor your liver function periodically. This is because, although Keppra and Topamax are less hepatotoxic compared to some other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), monitoring can help ensure that there are no unexpected adverse effects on the liver. The frequency might be less often than before, depending on your baseline liver function and the stability of your condition.\n\n2. **Addition of a Renal Panel**: Given that both Keppra and Topamax are excreted by the kidneys, monitoring kidney function becomes more critical. A renal panel, which typically includes tests like serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), and sometimes more specific markers of kidney function, can help assess how well your kidneys are handling the new medication load. The renal panel will likely become a part of your regular monitoring to ensure that your kidneys are not being adversely affected by the medications.\n\n3. **Therapeutic Drug Levels (TDM)**: This testing is crucial for many AEDs to ensure that the drug levels remain within a therapeutic range\u2014high enough to be effective in controlling seizures but not so high as to cause toxicity. For Keppra and Topamax, TDM might still be part of your monitoring, although the frequency can vary based on your response to the medication, the presence of side effects, and changes in your clinical condition.\n\n4. **CBC (Complete Blood Count) or FBC (Full Blood Count)**: This test is often used to monitor for potential hematologic side effects of medications (e.g., agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia with certain AEDs). Although less commonly associated with Keppra and Topamax, it might still be performed periodically as part of a comprehensive assessment, especially if you have a history of hematologic abnormalities or are on other medications that could affect blood cell counts.\n\nThe specifics of how this will play out for you depend on several factors, including:\n\n- **Your Healthcare Provider's Preference**: Different clinicians may have varying approaches to monitoring, influenced by guidelines, personal experience, and patient-specific factors.\n- **Clinical Guidelines**: Recommendations from professional societies (e.g., American Academy of Neurology, International League Against Epilepsy) can guide the monitoring strategy.\n- **Your Response to Medication**: How you tolerate the new medications, both in terms of efficacy and side effects, will influence the monitoring plan.\n- **Underlying Health Conditions**: Presence of kidney or liver disease, among other health issues, can necessitate more frequent or altered monitoring strategies.\n\nIt's essential to maintain open communication with your healthcare providers. If you have further questions or concerns about your monitoring plan, don't hesitate to ask. They can provide insights tailored to your specific situation and help you understand the rationale behind any changes in your testing regimen."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might be helpful.\n\nBlepharospasm is a condition characterized by involuntary spasms or contractions of the eyelid muscles, which can cause the eyelid to shut or twitch. While it's possible that blepharospasm could be related to your epilepsy, it's also a distinct condition that can have various causes, including:\n\n1. **Essential blepharospasm**: A primary condition characterized by recurring, involuntary eyelid spasms.\n2. **Secondary blepharospasm**: Caused by another condition, such as:\n\t* **Dystonia**: A neurological disorder that can cause muscle contractions and spasms.\n\t* **Parkinson's disease**: A neurodegenerative disorder that can cause tremors, rigidity, and other motor symptoms.\n\t* **Tardive dyskinesia**: A side effect of long-term antipsychotic medication use.\n\t* **Epilepsy**: In some cases, blepharospasm can be a seizure manifestation or a comorbid condition.\n\nConsidering your medical history, including epilepsy, OCD, ASD, and the medications you're taking, it's possible that your symptoms could be related to your epilepsy or another underlying condition. The fact that your left eye has been sticking closed for about 10 seconds at a time, several times a day, for two months, warrants further evaluation.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI strongly advise you to consult your **neurologist** about this new symptom. They are better equipped to assess the relationship between your blepharospasm and epilepsy, as well as rule out other potential causes. Your neurologist may:\n\n1. **Assess your seizure history and medication regimen** to determine if any changes or adjustments are needed.\n2. **Perform a physical examination** to evaluate your eyelid movements and check for any other signs of neurological dysfunction.\n3. **Conduct additional tests**, such as:\n\t* **Electromyography (EMG)**: To record the electrical activity of your eyelid muscles.\n\t* **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To monitor your brain activity and detect any seizure patterns.\n4. **Consider a referral** to a **movement disorders specialist** or an **ophthalmologist** if needed, to further evaluate and manage your blepharospasm.\n\nBefore your appointment, it's a good idea to:\n\n1. **Keep a symptom journal** to track the frequency, duration, and any potential triggers of your eyelid spasms.\n2. **Write down your questions and concerns** to discuss with your neurologist.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health, especially with a complex condition like epilepsy."

        "question": "Hi,My six month old son had his first infantile spasm yesterday. Took him to the ER (Canada), they performed an ultrasound which came back clean and booked an EEG for two weeks Tuesday.We are likely going to go over to the states Monday or Tuesday and pay out of pocket to get a quicker EEG as we are terrified of West syndrome and the sooner you can start treatment, the better.Tuberous sclerosis often occurs in tandem with West syndrome and although he doesn't show any signs of it now, it's often not possible to diagnose until later in life.It looks like a genetic mutation is responsible for TS so I'm wondering if this would be called out in a 23andme report? Obviously in theory it could be, just wondering if someone knows for sure.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I can sense your concern and urgency to get your son the necessary testing and potential treatment. Infantile spasms can be a worrying and unpredictable condition.\n\nRegarding your question about 23andMe and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), I'll provide some information to help you understand the situation.\n\nTSC is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. These genes are tumor suppressor genes, and mutations can lead to the development of non-cancerous tumors in various parts of the body, including the brain, eyes, heart, lungs, kidneys, and skin.\n\n23andMe is a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company that provides information on genetic variants associated with various health conditions, traits, and ancestry. However, their tests are not comprehensive, and they do not test for all possible genetic mutations.\n\nThe TSC1 and TSC2 genes are large, and there are many different mutations that can cause TSC. 23andMe's test may not detect all possible TSC-causing mutations, and even if they do, it's essential to note that:\n\n1. **23andMe is not a diagnostic test**: Their results are not intended to be used for diagnostic purposes, especially for complex conditions like TSC.\n2. **TSC diagnosis requires clinical evaluation**: A diagnosis of TSC typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies (e.g., MRI, CT scans), and genetic testing (e.g., sequencing of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes).\n3. **Genetic testing for TSC is usually done in a clinical setting**: If your son's doctors suspect TSC, they will likely order genetic testing specifically for TSC1 and TSC2 mutations through a clinical genetic testing laboratory.\n\nThat being said, if you have already done 23andMe testing on yourself or your son, you may be able to see if there are any reported variants in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. However, it's crucial to keep in mind that:\n\n* A negative result does not rule out TSC, as the test may not detect all possible mutations.\n* A positive result may not be diagnostic, as some variants may be benign or have uncertain significance.\n\nGiven the situation, it's understandable that you're exploring all possible options to get your son the necessary testing and care. If you're planning to travel to the US for an EEG, be sure to consult with your son's healthcare provider and the medical team in the US to ensure that you're getting the most relevant and accurate testing for his condition.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and my response is not a substitute for medical advice. I encourage you to discuss your concerns and questions with your son's healthcare provider and a genetic counselor, if possible. They can provide personalized guidance and help you navigate the complex process of diagnosis and treatment."

        "question": "When I woke up yesterday my back was so extremely tight it was hard to move. My head felt really weird, like waves were washing over it from my forehead towards the middle of my head. After that my arms and legs felt tingly the way Restless Leg Syndrome is described. My heart felt super weird (normal EKG last time I went to the ER for this) and I stopped breathing a few times, it was like I had to remember and force myself to breathe again. I got very tired at one point and think I passed out. Woke up what seemed like a few moments later a little confused.This happens every time my cycle comes on but I can usually prevent it by taking ibuprofen before or as soon as cramps start. This time I didn't have any cramps to warn me but I did not have the usual near-constant vomiting so, was able to eat and take ibuprofen. The symptoms subsided about 90% with the tingling still faintly present.I've been to the ER for this, the first time the doctor eventually gave me Ativan which helped like immediately, the second time I had to damn near beg for it. My esophagus tore and I started to vomit blood because nothing else would stop it.Could this be Catamenial Epilepsy? I have no history of Epilepsy in my family.Edit: In past episodes, I have been told I would have bouts of groaning or mumbling but I do not remember 90% of that.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some insights based on the information you've shared. It's clear that you're experiencing a complex and recurring condition that's closely tied to your menstrual cycle. The symptoms you've described, such as the extreme back tightness, strange sensations in your head, tingling in your arms and legs, and breathing difficulties, are quite severe and warrant thorough medical investigation.\n\nGiven your symptoms and their correlation with your menstrual cycle, Catamenial Epilepsy is a possibility. Catamenial Epilepsy refers to a type of epilepsy in which seizures are linked to the menstrual cycle. It's not uncommon for women with this condition to experience seizures around the time of their period, although the symptoms can vary widely. The fact that you don't have a family history of epilepsy doesn't rule out this diagnosis, as many cases of epilepsy have no known genetic link.\n\nThe response you had to Ativan in the ER is also worth noting. Ativan (lorazepam) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat seizures, among other conditions. Its effectiveness in your case could support the possibility of a seizure disorder.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, ideally a neurologist or an obstetrician-gynecologist with experience in managing menstrual-related disorders, for a comprehensive evaluation. They can review your medical history, perform necessary tests (which might include EEGs, hormone level checks, and possibly imaging studies), and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe episodes of groaning or mumbling that you're not aware of, combined with the fact that you don't remember most of what happens during these episodes, suggest a possible loss of consciousness or altered state, which could be indicative of seizures.\n\nIt's also important to address the esophageal tear and the episode of vomiting blood. These are serious complications that require attention and could be related to the intensity of your seizures or another underlying condition.\n\nIn the meantime, continuing to keep a detailed record of your symptoms, including when they occur in relation to your menstrual cycle, can be very helpful for your healthcare provider. Discussing your symptoms and any patterns you've noticed with your doctor can help in making a more accurate diagnosis and finding the appropriate treatment.\n\nRemember, while I can provide information and support, only a qualified healthcare professional can diagnose and treat medical conditions. It's essential to follow up with a doctor who can provide a personalized evaluation and care plan."

I could feel a very tender lump right where the occipital lymph node is (thanks google!) I did palpate it a lot, and it is extremely painful today. I was also up all night with an awful migraine (first one in months since I started Aimovig) and it spread to my entire head and it was 8/10 pain. I do not have a fever. My headache is better when upright and has gotten a bit better throughout the day but the very painful bulge is still there. It also hurts at rest in that area. I felt lethargic and drained this morning.Took a covid test. Negative. Worried I have an infection or something but no fever? I have a big, painful and possible infected spit of cystic acne on my right cheek. Not sure if related.I\u2019ve also been having bad muscular pain on the right side of my shoulder after packing and lifting boxes, it kept me up thursday night. But it got better-ish. Not sure if it\u2019s related. Kinda feels worse today.Should I be concerned? It hurts to turn my head/move my head at alland I know that if I lie down my headache would return. If i even brush the lymph node it hurts so much. Was hard to brush my hair.Any insight appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: swollen potential lymph node in the occipital area at the base of skull. very painful. have a headache. concerned about infection but no fever.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you reached out for insight! Given your symptoms, it's understandable that you're concerned. I'll try to break down the possible causes and offer some guidance.\n\n**Painful lump in the occipital area:**\nThe occipital lymph node is located at the base of the skull, and swelling or tenderness in this area can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. **Infection:** Although you don't have a fever, it's still possible that you have a localized infection, such as a viral or bacterial infection, that's causing the lymph node to swell.\n2. **Referred pain:** The pain in your neck and base of skull could be referred pain from another area, such as your shoulder or spine.\n3. **Migraine-related:** Your migraine episode could be contributing to the pain and tenderness in the occipital area.\n\n**Cystic acne on your right cheek:**\nWhile it's possible that the acne is unrelated, it's also possible that it's contributing to the swollen lymph node. Infected acne can cause lymph nodes to become swollen and tender.\n\n**Recent medication changes:**\nYou started Aptiom two weeks ago, which is a medication for epilepsy. It's possible that you're experiencing a side effect or an interaction with one of your other medications.\n\n**Other factors:**\nThe muscular pain on the right side of your shoulder, caused by packing and lifting boxes, might be contributing to the overall discomfort and pain in your neck and head.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Contact your doctor:** Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a specialist (e.g., neurologist, dermatologist) to discuss your symptoms. They can perform a physical examination, review your medical history, and order any necessary tests (e.g., imaging, blood work) to determine the cause of the swollen lymph node and headache.\n2. **Monitor your symptoms:** Keep track of your symptoms, including the pain levels, any changes in the swelling, and any potential triggers or factors that exacerbate the discomfort.\n3. **Manage your symptoms:** In the meantime, consider over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) to help manage your headache and neck pain. Apply a warm compress to the affected area to help reduce discomfort.\n4. **Follow up on your Covid test:** Although your initial test was negative, if you develop any respiratory symptoms or your symptoms worsen, consider repeating the test to rule out Covid-19.\n\n**When to seek immediate attention:**\n\n* If your symptoms worsen or you experience:\n\t+ Severe headache or neck pain\n\t+ Difficulty swallowing or breathing\n\t+ Weakness or numbness in your face, arm, or leg\n\t+ Fever (above 101.5\u00b0F)\n\t+ Confusion or disorientation\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Seeking medical attention will help determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive proper treatment."

        "question": "Hi everyone. Just wanting some opinions on this very confusing presentation. My sis in law, 30F, 5'5, smoker, with a suspected eating disorder (binge-purge-restrict cycle) has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy after having 2 seizures within an hour of eachother. She is also on treatment for depression and takes a sleeping tablet daily.The epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed after they ran a few tests. This was a surprise as there's no family history of epilepsy. The neurologist suggested it may be due to the depression meds (an uncommon side effect).Anyway, it has been 3 months since this diagnosis came. Last night, she had a seizure and was groggy and a bit confused for about 2 hours following it. The family understood this to be normal so just followed protocol.Thereafter, she started speaking in 3rd person and with completely different voice. She was not fooling aroud and quite honestly, freaked the hell out of everyone. She kept making degrading comments about herself and said, \"Kim is always complaining. Leave her at the back. Leave her at the back\". She switched to a different accent and displayed child-like behavior for a few minutes (giggling and kept hugging her pillow).She then spoke normally and complained of feeling dizzy. She had another seizure shortly after. She was taken to hospital where she had another seizure on arrival. At this point, she was completely incoherent and demanded paper and pen. She wrote random words on a page.Currently doing CT scan and blood tests. Will only be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. Any ideas of what could be happening?I initially thought of the possibility of drug use but she has been staying with her parents for 3 months straight and hasn't left the house or received any visitors at all in this period",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can try to provide some insights based on the information you've shared.\n\nThe sudden change in behavior, speech, and accent after a seizure is unusual and concerning. There are a few possibilities that might be considered:\n\n1. **Postictal psychosis**: This is a rare condition that can occur after a seizure, characterized by a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, such as altered mental status, confusion, and bizarre behavior. It's usually short-lived, but can be disturbing for those witnessing it.\n2. **Todd's paralysis with psychiatric symptoms**: After a seizure, some people may experience Todd's paralysis, which can manifest as a temporary inability to speak, move, or respond. In some cases, this can be accompanied by psychiatric symptoms like altered personality, hallucinations, or confusion.\n3. **Complex partial seizures**: These seizures can cause altered mental status, automatisms (repetitive behaviors), and changes in speech or behavior. They can be preceded or followed by other seizure types, like the ones your sister-in-law experienced.\n4. **Dissociative episode**: Although less likely, given the context of seizures, it's possible that your sister-in-law experienced a dissociative episode, which can manifest as a sudden change in behavior, speech, or identity (e.g., speaking in the third person).\n5. **Medication side effects or interactions**: As you mentioned, the depression medication might be contributing to the seizures. It's also possible that the medications she's taking are interacting with each other or causing side effects that are contributing to these strange behaviors.\n6. **Other neurological conditions**: Although the epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed, it's possible that there's an underlying condition, such as a brain tumor, encephalitis, or a metabolic disorder, that's contributing to these symptoms.\n\nIt's reassuring that she's undergoing a CT scan and blood tests, and that she'll be seen by a neurologist tomorrow. These investigations will help rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to these symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to ensure her safety and provide a supportive environment. It's also crucial to keep a detailed record of her symptoms, seizures, and any changes in behavior or medication to share with the neurologist.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these are just speculative ideas, and only a thorough medical evaluation can provide a definitive diagnosis and guidance on the next steps.\n\nHow is the family coping with this situation, and have you noticed any other unusual behaviors or symptoms in your sister-in-law since her epilepsy diagnosis?"

        "question": "25y/o male, 5ft9, 70kg Since a couple of weeks my partner has been completely intolerant to stimuli (24/7). He can\u2019t tolerate the slightest bit of light (not even his phone or laptop), he can\u2019t tolerate any physical activity such as standing up or walking around, when eating his situation deteriorates as well. And what I mean with situation is the fact that he has a constant headache (stabbing, like knives in the back of the head), is nauseous, vomits, has distorted balance, confusion and this all is at it\u2019s worsed when standing up (it could very rarely be tolerable while lying down but the second he stands up it is intolerable). He also had anisocoria at two seperate moments. He can\u2019t function anymore because of all the combined symptoms. We visited multiple doctors with no diagnosis. He does not take any medication anymore (besides his nitroglycerine dermal patches 5mg/day), he forcebly stopped the rest of his medication because it also profoundly worsened his condition.Sincerest gratitude to any helpVisited multiple internal medicine doctors (gastro-enterology and hepatology), 3 neurologists (who all did not suspect meningitis, thats why we didn\u2019t go to the ER, also I have a little medical background and if I would have suspected it to be meningitis I also wouldn\u2019t have doubted and rushes him to the ER), a lot of general practitioners. They performerd US of the liver, CT of the liver, MRCP of the liver, multiple blood analyses (in blood analyses a couple weeks ago he had ALT and AST were 5x the reference value but since then came back to normal, low ceruloplasmine, low carnitine but supplements were given), EEG (no abnormalities), MRI brains (no abnormalities). On de CT they saw narrow bileducts, but not significant. Still waiting on results of MRCP liver. One neurologist prescribes blood and urinalysis for wilsons disease and porphyria but due to his condition we haven\u2019t been able to go to the lab yet to get them done.",

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll try to provide some insights and potential directions for further investigation.\n\nIt's clear that your partner is experiencing a complex and debilitating set of symptoms, which have not been adequately addressed by the doctors you've visited so far. I'll try to summarize the main points:\n\n1. **Persistent headache, nausea, vomiting, and balance issues**: These symptoms are concerning and could be related to various conditions, including neurological, gastrointestinal, or even infectious causes.\n2. **Intolerance to stimuli**: The fact that your partner can't tolerate light, physical activity, or even eating suggests a possible issue with his autonomic nervous system or a condition that affects his overall physiological response to stress.\n3. **Anisocoria**: The presence of anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes) on two separate occasions is a significant finding and may indicate a neurological or autonomic nervous system issue.\n4. **Normal EEG and MRI brain scans**: These results suggest that there may not be a significant structural or electrical abnormality in the brain.\n5. **Abnormal liver function tests (ALT and AST)**: The elevated liver enzymes, which have since normalized, could be indicative of a liver issue, but the CT and MRI scans of the liver did not show significant abnormalities.\n6. **Low ceruloplasmin and carnitine levels**: These findings may be relevant, but it's unclear how they relate to your partner's overall condition.\n7. **Narrow bile ducts on CT scan**: This finding may be worth further investigation, but it's unclear if it's significant.\n\nGiven the complexity of your partner's symptoms, it's not surprising that multiple doctors have been unable to provide a clear diagnosis. However, I would like to suggest some potential directions for further investigation:\n\n1. **Autonomic nervous system dysfunction**: Consider consulting a doctor specializing in autonomic nervous system disorders, as your partner's symptoms may be related to dysautonomia.\n2. **Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS)**: This condition can cause a range of symptoms, including those your partner is experiencing, such as intolerance to stimuli, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues.\n3. **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: This condition is characterized by a rapid heart rate and other symptoms that worsen when standing, which may be relevant to your partner's experience.\n4. **Infectious diseases**: Although you mentioned that the neurologists did not suspect meningitis, it's essential to consider other infectious diseases that could cause similar symptoms, such as Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, or viral infections.\n5. **Endocrine disorders**: Hormonal imbalances, such as adrenal insufficiency or thyroid disorders, could contribute to your partner's symptoms.\n6. **Toxicity or environmental factors**: Exposure to toxins or environmental factors, such as heavy metals or mold, could be exacerbating your partner's condition.\n7. **Psychological factors**: Although it's essential to prioritize physical explanations, it's also crucial to consider the psychological impact of your partner's symptoms and the potential role of stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\nTo move forward, I recommend:\n\n1. **Consult a specialist in autonomic nervous system disorders or a neurologist with expertise in dysautonomia**.\n2. **Pursue the blood and urinalysis tests for Wilson's disease and porphyria**, as suggested by the neurologist.\n3. **Consider a comprehensive diagnostic workup**, including tests for infectious diseases, endocrine disorders, and toxic exposures.\n4. **Keep a detailed symptom journal** to track any patterns, triggers, or changes in your partner's condition.\n5. **Seek a second opinion** from a doctor or a multidisciplinary team with experience in complex, undiagnosed cases.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be patient and persistent in the pursuit of a diagnosis. I hope this information helps, and I wish you and your partner the best in finding a solution to his condition."

        "question": "I 18M have frontal lobe epilepsy and started smoking weed before I was diagnosed but now it's getting a bit boring and im often offered molly and coke and was wondering if it was safe for me to take since I'm fine with weed and booze",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's not recommended to use substances like molly or coke, especially with a pre-existing medical condition such as frontal lobe epilepsy. Molly (MDMA) and cocaine are potent substances that can have unpredictable interactions with your condition and any medications you might be taking.\n\n1.  **Seizure Risk**: Both molly and cocaine can potentially lower the seizure threshold, which means they could increase the risk of a seizure. This is particularly concerning for someone with epilepsy.\n\n2.  **Interactions with Medications**: If you're taking medications for your epilepsy, molly and coke can interact with these drugs in unpredictable ways. This could either reduce the effectiveness of your medication or increase the risk of side effects.\n\n3.  **Other Health Risks**: Both substances carry their own set of health risks. Molly can cause hyperthermia, dehydration, and serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. Cocaine can lead to heart problems, including heart attacks, and can have severe effects on mental health.\n\n4.  **Legal Considerations**: In many places, molly and coke are illegal substances. Possessing or using them can lead to serious legal consequences.\n\n5.  **Addiction**: Both molly and coke have potential for addiction. Using them could lead to a pattern of dependence that's hard to break."

        "question": " My fiance' of 3 years is currently experiencing SRSE it is currently day 10 and I am losing all hope. I have come here for help, answers, possible experimental ideas any other stories/survivor stories or anything. Please.Age: Turned 24, Sex: Female, Height: 5'4\", Weight: 108, Race: WhiteDuration: First Seizure episode Friday June 30th ~8:30pm Medical issues: none (only medication use is Prozac switched about a month ago from Busiprone I believe); not sure if this is relevant but I learned about the babinski during class back in March and tried it on her before explaining what it even was and tried it again with hand clench to take her mind off the reflex test. She showed positive babinski on both feet but asymptomatic? i told my professor and he said there must be something going on and to see a neurologist. this was never followed up on as she was completely healthy. mother's history fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis - no other known issues. Father: unknown medical history. Drug use: Marijuana (daily), Alcohol (very frequent, 4-5 weekly); urinalysis and other tests proved negative for any other drug I may have been unaware of.  Backstory: Went camping for her birthday on June 24th (Saturday). Received several insect bites during camping trip. By Monday or Tuesday (June 26th/27th) she was starting to feel slightly ill - some nausea and vomiting, elevated temperature. She did complain of soreness, muscle soreness, very odd pain she explained. Some headache issues as well. This lasted until Thursday - by Thursday she was starting to feel pretty much back to normal and she had decided not to see a doctor as it had seemed to pass. Friday morning she was nauseous and vomited and was unable to eat. She napped and woke up around 8:30pm and while taking a drink of water she experienced a convulsive seizure around 3-4 minutes long (no history of seizures, ever). No altered mental state before as we were speaking less than 20 seconds before the seizure starrted. 911 was called and she was transported to hospital. Initially it was thought it could be due to dehydration as she was unable to eat very little during the week and much lower liquid intake. Blood tests/CT all negative and dehydration was not very severe according to the doctor. She was given phenergan and a sodium chloride IV and discharged 4 hours after going into the hospital, told to follow up with primary care Monday and \"hope to not have another one.\" She never regained base line mental functioning before falling asleep (no real meaningful sentences/never aware she was at hospital), but this was assured to me to be postictal. She could not walk to the car to be discharged. She made it through the night with no issues but I was awoken around 9am by a short 15 second seizure. Followed by several more over the next hour in which she never fully regained true consciousness (she only said \"headache\"). 911 was called after being advised the first two short ones shouldn't be an issue she was postictal - i decided to drive her to the hospital but she went into a sustained convulsive seizure and 911 was called again - the last seizure lasted ~30-45 minutes before being controlled at the hospital. She has been intubated and sedated since then.Current situation: Day 10 of pretty much uncontrolled seizure activity despite all interventions.  Diagnosis: SRSE. meningitis and encephalitis - cause - unknown. Three lumbar punctures (one before antiviral/antibiotics) all negative. Currently waiting for autoimmune disorder labs. Too unstable for MRI and doctor said it was unimportant until stopping seizures. Last MRI looked fine (taken last sunday or monday)Treatment: Propofol since day one as high as she can tolerate. Midozolam drip, three seizure medications (keppra and I can't remember the two). No response, seizure activity mostly continued by EEG recording. Ativan stops them for a short time ( no longer being used). By day 4 they introduced phenobarbital which stopped seizures for 12 hours before returning. most seizures resolve in less than 2 minutes without any BOLUS of propofol or other medicines but some last >10 minutes which must be hit with medicine. After phenobarbital failed they tried ketamine and depakote. It worked for about 12 hours and failed again. Phenobarbitol worked for a few hours and failed again. Her organs are functioning fairly fine, liver slightly down, kidney's producing a lot of urine output due to lasix. She is incredibly swollen at this point but slightly reduced due to lasix - still has some fluid around lungs. Blood pressure and heart rate are fine but oxygen has slowly been dropping. Today she got into the mid 80s, they increased her oxygen input to 100% and she has been holding around 95% blood oxygentation. Steroids have now been administered. In the morning they plan to put her into a barbiturate coma and hope that this stops the seizures but the neurologist has been incredibly hesitant to go this route due to complications. I believe the medication is pentobarbital. They are exhausting everything they know to do. I have searched the literature I have access to and just have no answers and I know the doctors are doing what they can but I am just reaching out for anyone that may know more. Have any of you experienced this before? Any other ideas as to what could be going on? With seizures this prolonged (as many as 70 in a day) will she retain any mental functioning whatsoever if she was to wake up? Can she actually recover from this in anyway at all? Please..just any knowledge or hope or even the hard truth. The only other hopeful thing I have found is the study with use of allopregnanolone (poor power though n=2; both recovered normal mental functioning >7 days SRSE with 3-4 days of pentobarbital coma while allopregnanolone was administered during weaning of pento) Please help.

        "answer": "I can sense the desperation and helplessness in your words, and I'm here to offer any assistance and guidance I can. I'll try to provide some insights, ideas, and potential avenues to explore, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with your fianc\u00e9e's medical team for personalized advice.\n\n**Understanding SRSE**\n\nStatus Epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by prolonged or recurrent seizures without full recovery between them. SRSE, in particular, is a subset of SE that lasts for more than 24 hours, often requiring aggressive treatment. The causes of SRSE can be diverse, including infections, autoimmune disorders, metabolic imbalances, and unknown etiologies.\n\n**Potential causes**\n\nGiven your fianc\u00e9e's history, some potential causes to consider include:\n\n1. **Infections**: Although her lumbar punctures were negative, it's possible that the infection might be localized or not detected. The recent camping trip and insect bites could be relevant.\n2. **Autoimmune disorders**: The positive Babinski sign, although asymptomatic, might indicate an underlying autoimmune condition. The autoimmune disorder labs may provide more clarity.\n3. **Encephalitis**: The diagnosis of encephalitis is already considered, but it's essential to continue exploring potential causes, such as viral, bacterial, or fungal infections.\n4. **Other possibilities**: Other potential causes, such as vasculitis, mitochondrial disorders, or paraneoplastic syndromes, might be considered, although they are less likely.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment plan seems aggressive, with multiple antiepileptic medications, sedatives, and interventions like pentobarbital coma. The use of steroids is also a reasonable approach, given the potential for an autoimmune component.\n\n**Allopregnanolone and pentobarbital coma**\n\nThe study you mentioned, using allopregnanolone in conjunction with pentobarbital coma, is intriguing. While the sample size is small, the results are promising. It's essential to discuss this option with the neurologist and consider its potential benefits and risks.\n\n**Mental functioning and recovery**\n\nThe prolonged duration of seizures and the intensity of the treatment may impact your fianc\u00e9e's mental functioning. However, it's difficult to predict the extent of the potential damage. Some patients with SRSE can recover with minimal cognitive impairment, while others may experience significant deficits.\n\n** Experimental ideas and potential next steps**\n\nConsidering the complexity of the case, it might be helpful to:\n\n1. **Consult with a specialized neurologist**: A second opinion from a neurologist with expertise in SRSE and autoimmune disorders could provide fresh insights.\n2. **Explore additional diagnostic tests**: Discuss the possibility of additional tests, such as:\n\t* Autoimmune panel (e.g., NMDA receptor antibodies, LGI1 antibodies)\n\t* Infectious disease panels (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal)\n\t* Metabolic screenings (e.g., mitochondrial function, organic acidemia)\n3. **Consider alternative treatments**: Depending on the results of the diagnostic tests, alternative treatments like:\n\t* Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\n\t* Plasmapheresis\n\t* Other immunomodulatory therapies\n4. **Supportive care**: Ensure that your fianc\u00e9e receives optimal supportive care, including:\n\t* Aggressive seizure management\n\t* Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function\n\t* Nutritional support\n\t* Preventive measures for complications like deep vein thrombosis and pressure ulcers\n\n**Survivor stories and community support**\n\nWhile every case is unique, connecting with others who have experienced SRSE can provide emotional support and valuable insights. You can try searching online for support groups, forums, or social media communities focused on SRSE, epilepsy, or autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Please stay strong and advocate for your fianc\u00e9e**\n\nIt's essential to maintain open communication with the medical team and advocate for your fianc\u00e9e's care. Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek second opinions, or explore alternative options. Remember that you're not alone in this journey, and there are resources available to support you and your loved one.\n\nKeep in mind that every case is unique, and the prognosis can be uncertain. While it's essential to be prepared for the worst, it's also crucial to maintain hope and focus on the potential for recovery. I'll be here to support you, and I hope that your fianc\u00e9e receives the best possible care and outcomes."

        "question": " Ok, first things first this is kind of an update of my old post that I originally had on here. I should also clarify I've actually had this for a long time and never really worried about it mainly due to my seizures always being controlled however this hasn't been the case the last few years hence why I'm now looking more into it. Apologies as a lot of the information is either old or irrelevant. This is basically a very shortened version of how the Nuroligest diagnosed it So from what I know is this: The official diagnosis is Temprole lobe epilepsy with seizures mainly being focal impaired awareness seizures and very rarely tonic-clonic seizures Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus. Regional (cerebral) atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus Right-sided Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) MRI. quite clearly shows abnormalities involving the right hippocampus with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis and some associated regional atrophy of the dorsal right thalamus. There was noted also a T-weighted high signal gliosis within the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe with associated ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone  Possible cause: seizure-related brain injury or possibly the sequelae of previous ischemic inflammatory insult. So I'm not really questioning the diagnosis I'm just trying to get some more understanding of some of these terms: ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone. T-weighted high-signal gliosis, abnormalities ( Now I know this is a very obvious term but what could it mean in relation to the right hippocampus), associated regional atrophy, periventricular white matter (I'm trying to find out whether this is a part of the damage or just a part of the brain in general), Thanks, everyone.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'd be happy to help you understand the terms related to your diagnosis.\n\n1. **Ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone**: This term refers to the expansion or enlargement of the ventricular system in the brain, specifically the trigone area, due to the loss of surrounding brain tissue. \"Ex-vacuo\" means \"from empty space.\" In your case, it's likely that the regional atrophy (shrinkage) of the right dorsal thalamus and other surrounding areas has led to a compensatory expansion of the ventricular system.\n2. **T-weighted high-signal gliosis**: In MRI scans, \"T-weighted\" refers to a specific technique used to produce images. A \"high-signal\" area appears brighter on the image. Gliosis is a term used to describe the activation of glial cells, which are support cells in the brain, in response to injury or inflammation. In your case, the high-signal gliosis in the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe suggests that there may be some inflammation or scarring in this area, possibly related to previous seizures or other insults.\n3. **Abnormalities involving the right hippocampus**: The hippocampus is a critical structure involved in memory formation and seizure regulation. Abnormalities in this area can contribute to seizures, particularly focal impaired awareness seizures. In your case, the abnormalities may be related to the mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), which is a condition characterized by scarring and shrinkage of the hippocampus.\n4. **Associated regional atrophy**: Atrophy refers to the shrinkage or loss of brain tissue. In your case, the regional atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus suggests that this area has been affected by the seizures or underlying condition, leading to tissue loss.\n5. **Periventricular white matter**: The periventricular white matter refers to the area of white matter ( bundles of nerve fibers) surrounding the ventricles in the brain. This area is not necessarily damaged in your case, but rather, it's where the gliosis (inflammation/scarring) is located. The periventricular white matter is a normal part of the brain's anatomy, but in your case, it's affected by the gliosis.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* The abnormalities in the right hippocampus and mesial temporal sclerosis are likely contributing to your seizures.\n* The regional atrophy of the right dorsal thalamus and ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular trigone are likely secondary effects of the seizures or underlying condition.\n* The T-weighted high-signal gliosis in the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe may indicate some inflammation or scarring in this area, possibly related to previous seizures or other insults.\n\nIt's great that you're taking a proactive approach to understanding your condition. Consult with your neurologist or a specialist to discuss how these findings relate to your specific situation and treatment options."

I am right eye dominant, but I have figured out how to switch between eyes and make my left eye dominant. However, then my right eye will wander. Somehow my glasses bring my eyes back to center.I went to my optometrist and she suggested myasthenia gravis. I spoke with my neurologist and he went ahead and put me on mestinon pending antibody results. My bloodwork came back in two weeks, and my antibodies were negative and my doctor took me off of mestinon and told me he doesn\u2019t want to do any further testing. in that time frame I had developed other symptoms. I also have times where my breathing will become very shallow and I will take a deep breath and rinse-repeat all night.Before my other symptoms began I had had a seizure at work and five more in the ER, but my neuro says the two are unrelated. I have a very noticeable tremor in my hands and sometimes in my body. My palms will turn bright red and then the rest of my body will flush and turn bright red, including the soles of my feet. The other day part of my left foot turned a grayish-purple color.I have developed severe vertigo with nystagmus. I will throw up from it so violently that I will wet myself. Some days I cannot even move my eyes without vomiting. I was diagnosed with anterior vertigo, and then my PT came back and said he thinks it is actually oscillopsia. I have complex migraines and tried to take a triptan for it. Sometimes it will help, but other times it will not. I also have epilepsy and Hashimotos/hypothyroid, but I have had no recent medication changes. I have had an MRI of my vestibular system and was told it was normal. I have been referred to a neuro ophthalmologist.Medications: Synthroid, trileptal, lamictal, protonix, oxybutinin, abilify, and Seroquel. No recent medication changes. I have had both rounds of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.Edited to add: I also have times where the muscles in my eyes will let go and I will be unable to open them, or I will just look really stoned.",

        "question": " My wife has very recently, after several extremely trying years, been diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Some backstory is required before I can pose my question:Originally my wife presented with hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile). We naturally sought psychiatric treatment. A slew of medicine was prescribed on the assumption of schizophrenia. I can remember Risperdol, Lamictal, and Effexor, among a few others. This helped her moods and backed the symptoms down a bit for a while.Later on, probably 8-10 months, the hallucinations were getting stronger, accompanied by suicidal tendencies and self-harm, and a new symptom arose that looked a lot like absent seizures. This ultimately culminated in her carving the word \"HELP\" into her thigh with a pair of scissors, followed by the obvious involuntary commitment, which was spent at the hospital. This led to a new diagnosis, epilepsy. It was explained to us then that hallucinations can be a symptom of epilepsy. This was new info to me. She was prescribed Keppra and sent home. The hallucinations subsided entirely within a few weeks.With the addition of Keppra, she weaned off Risperdol and Lamictal as instructed. What followed after was a marked increase in the absent seizures, now characterized by entirely different symptoms. She would now have standard post-ictal headaches, occasionally some aphasia where she couldn't speak but could still communicate with ASL, and usually some transient amnesia with associated confusion. This would range from forgetting a few days to forgetting several years, sometimes not even recognizing me (we've been together almost four years). These periods of amnesia would last anywhere from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours on bad days.On followup with the neuro who gave the epilepsy diagnosis, a seven day at-home video EEG was ordered. This had to be cut short at day 3 due to a skin reaction she was having, either to the glue or tape, I dunno. The next followup, to go over the test findings, resulted in a diagnosis of PNES as the EEG showed no abnormal brain activity after capturing over a dozen episodes.  Happy to finally have a diagnosis that seemed to cover everything, we followed the neuro's order to ween off Keppra and sought a change in treatment plan at the psychiatrist. This was about one month ago. She came completely off the Keppra about five days ago...And suddenly the hallucinations are back.I'm not smart enough to make heads nor tails of this, despite loads of online research. Getting in with the neuro or the neuropsychologist to which we were referred will take quite some time.The best thing I can come up with is some data suggesting that an estimated 10-25% of individuals with PNES also have epilepsy, which leads me to suspect that the Keppra may have controlled her epilepsy (and the related hallucinations) to a point that the PNES and its symptoms became more obvious.My questions are: Does my theory make sense? If so, is it likely? No other medicines have been added or removed except the Keppra, so why would the hallucinations come back?I'd appreciate any insight or direction that any of you may have to offer.Thank you.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide you with some insight, and while I'm not a medical professional, I'll try to break down the information and offer some possible explanations.\n\n**Theory:** Your theory that the Keppra may have controlled a potential underlying epilepsy, which in turn masked the hallucinations, makes sense. It's possible that the Keppra, an anticonvulsant, was having a positive effect on a seizure disorder, and its removal has led to the return of hallucinations.\n\n**Likelihood:** The co-occurrence of PNES and epilepsy is acknowledged in the medical literature, with estimates suggesting that 10-25% of individuals with PNES may also have epilepsy. This supports the possibility that your wife may have an underlying seizure disorder.\n\n**Return of hallucinations:** The return of hallucinations after discontinuing Keppra could be related to several factors:\n\n1. **Loss of anticonvulsant effect:** As you mentioned, the Keppra may have been controlling a seizure disorder, which in turn reduced the frequency or severity of hallucinations. Without the Keppra, the seizures (if present) could be contributing to the return of hallucinations.\n2. **Withdrawal effects:** Stopping anticonvulsants like Keppra can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations. However, this is less likely, as the Keppra was tapered off under medical supervision.\n3. **Other underlying conditions:** It's possible that the hallucinations are related to an underlying condition other than epilepsy or PNES, such as a psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorder. The return of hallucinations could indicate that this underlying condition is still present and not being adequately addressed.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n1. **Re-evaluate the diagnosis:** Given the complexity of your wife's symptoms, it's essential to reconsider the diagnosis of PNES and epilepsy. A comprehensive re-evaluation by a neurologist, psychiatrist, or a multidisciplinary team may help clarify the diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan.\n2. **Medication review:** Review the medication history, including the effects of Keppra, to determine if it's possible to reintroduce it or try alternative anticonvulsants to help control seizures (if present) and hallucinations.\n3. **Addressing PNES:** While the diagnosis of PNES is significant, it's essential to address the underlying psychological and emotional issues that may be contributing to the development and maintenance of PNES symptoms.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult a neurologist or psychiatrist:** Request an urgent follow-up with the neurologist or psychiatrist to discuss the return of hallucinations and the potential need to reassess the diagnosis and treatment plan.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal:** Encourage your wife to keep a detailed journal of her symptoms, including the frequency, duration, and characteristics of hallucinations, seizures (if present), and any other relevant symptoms.\n3. **Seek a second opinion:** Consider consulting a specialist in epilepsy, psychogenic seizures, or a neuropsychiatrist to gain a fresh perspective on your wife's case.\n\nRemember, each individual's situation is unique, and it's essential to work closely with healthcare professionals to develop a personalized treatment plan. I hope this information helps you and your wife navigate this challenging situation."

And like always I fainted but I also started moving my arms and leg uncontrollably lucky the needle was removed before.Anyone know what could cause this or the actual naming?Age: 21 (22 in 3 month)Sex: Male",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you've had to go through this experience repeatedly.\n\nThe combination of fainting (syncope) and uncontrollable movement of your arms and legs during a blood draw is a concerning symptom. There are several possible explanations, and I'll try to provide some insights. Please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to discuss your specific situation with your doctor or a specialist.\n\nThe uncontrollable movement of your arms and legs could be related to:\n\n1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common cause of fainting during blood draws, especially in people with a history of anxiety or fear of needles. Vasovagal syncope can sometimes be accompanied by involuntary movements, such as tremors or convulsions, due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and decreased blood flow to the brain.\n2. **Convulsive syncope**: This is a type of syncope that can cause brief, uncontrollable movements, often resembling a seizure. Convulsive syncope is thought to be related to the brain's response to the sudden loss of blood flow and oxygen.\n3. **Anxiety-induced seizures**: In some cases, extreme anxiety or stress can trigger a seizure-like event, which may manifest as uncontrollable movements.\n\nOther possible contributing factors to consider:\n\n* **Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)**: While NF1 is primarily associated with tumor growth and other symptoms, some research suggests that people with NF1 may be more prone to seizures or abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n* **Medical history**: Your history of fainting during blood draws may have led to a conditioned response, making you more susceptible to anxiety-induced symptoms.\n\nTo better understand what happened, I recommend discussing the following with your doctor:\n\n* The specifics of your episode, including any preceding symptoms or feelings\n* Your medical history, including your NF1 diagnosis and any previous seizures or seizure-like events\n* Any changes in your medication or health status that may be relevant\n\nYour doctor may consider:\n\n* **Evaluating your anxiety levels**: To determine if anxiety is contributing to your symptoms and to discuss possible coping strategies or anxiety-reducing techniques.\n* **Reviewing your NF1 management plan**: To ensure that your condition is being adequately managed and to explore any potential connections between your NF1 and your fainting episodes.\n* **Neurological evaluation**: To assess for any underlying neurological conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n* **Alternative blood draw methods**: To explore options that may reduce your anxiety and discomfort during future blood draws, such as using a topical anesthetic or a different phlebotomy technique.\n\nRemember to prioritize your health and well-being, and don't hesitate to seek medical attention if you experience any further concerning symptoms.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with or if you have any specific questions!"

        "question": "Our son was recently diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. We were out of town for 1 week and he started having seizures 1-2 times per day. The episodes were short (20-30 seconds) but essentially he would feel dizzy, sit down confused, occasionally vomit and forget what happenedWent to an out of town hospital (emergency) and had EEG, CT, MRI, MRAs completed with no sign for the cause of the seizures. But the EEG did register slower brain waves indicating epilepsy.Neurologist placed our son on Keppra at 2ml dosage. Since taking the meds he had two very minor episodes during the first week (feels dizzy and needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t lose consciousness or forget what happened). For the past week (2nd week of dosage) he has had no events.We went to see our neurologist today and he would like to increase the dosage from 2ml to 3ml. I\u2019m a little confused since the meds are working at 2ml why up the dosage given all the potential side effects that can happen. I\u2019m not against the meds and fully respect the doctors opinion. The meds are clearly helping and I know that the doctors have his best health in mind but my concern is from a completely laymen\u2019s uniformed perspective it doesn\u2019t make sense to up the dosage unless we don\u2019t see improvement?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I completely understand your concerns and questions! It's natural to wonder why the dosage needs to be increased when the medication seems to be working at the current dose. I'll try to provide some insights to help you better understand the situation.\n\n**Why increase the dosage if the medication is working?**\n\nThere are several reasons why the neurologist might recommend increasing the dosage:\n\n1. **Achieving optimal seizure control**: Although your son has had no major episodes in the second week, the neurologist may want to ensure that the medication is at a sufficient level to prevent future seizures. Seizures can be unpredictable, and the goal is to achieve complete seizure control.\n2. **Stabilizing brain wave activity**: The EEG showed slower brain waves indicating epilepsy, which suggests that the brain's electrical activity is not fully normalized. Increasing the dosage may help stabilize brain wave activity, reducing the risk of future seizures.\n3. **Long-term management**: Epilepsy is a chronic condition, and the goal is to find the right balance of medication to manage seizures over the long term. The neurologist may be adjusting the dosage to find the optimal level to maintain seizure control while minimizing side effects.\n4. **Preventing breakthrough seizures**: Although your son has had no major episodes, the two minor episodes during the first week may indicate that the current dosage is not sufficient to completely prevent seizures. Increasing the dosage may help prevent future breakthrough seizures.\n\n**Potential side effects and dosage increases**\n\nYou're right to be concerned about potential side effects, as Keppra (levetiracetam) can cause various side effects, such as drowsiness, fatigue, and behavioral changes. However, the neurologist will carefully monitor your son's response to the medication and adjust the dosage accordingly.\n\nWhen increasing the dosage, the neurologist will typically:\n\n1. **Monitor for side effects**: Closely watch for any new or worsening side effects and adjust the dosage or add other medications to mitigate them.\n2. **Assess seizure control**: Continuously evaluate your son's seizure activity to ensure the medication is effective.\n3. **Adjust the dosage gradually**: The neurologist may increase the dosage gradually to minimize the risk of side effects and allow your son's body to adjust to the new level.\n\n**Discussion with the neurologist**\n\nIt's essential to discuss your concerns and questions with the neurologist. Ask them to explain their reasoning behind the dosage increase and what you can expect. Some questions to consider asking:\n\n1. What are the specific goals for increasing the dosage?\n2. How will you monitor my son's response to the increased dosage?\n3. What are the potential side effects, and how will you manage them?\n4. What are the risks of not increasing the dosage, and how might it affect my son's seizure control?\n\nBy having an open and informed discussion with the neurologist, you'll better understand their decision-making process and feel more confident in the treatment plan."

Immediately, my paranoid brain went to my endocrinologist telling me a couple weeks ago that my lymphocytes have been low for the last two years (0.9) and that one of my liver values is slightly high. My neutrophils, which I understand can be affected by the carbimazole, are normal according to a blood test done just before I stopped taking it.Later, my rational brain kicked in and remembered that I just had a tetanus shot last week in the left arm. I have a doctor's appointment coming up and will certainly mention it, but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance in the meantime. Could it be the tetanus shot that has caused the lymph node swelling? Google results are terrifying for that particular node. Thanks in advance.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to provide you with some reassurance and information. \n\nFirstly, it's great that you have a doctor's appointment coming up, and you should definitely mention the lump to your doctor. In the meantime, let's explore the possible causes of the swelling and lump above your left clavicle.\n\nGiven your recent tetanus vaccination in the left arm, it's highly likely that the swelling and lump are related to the vaccine. Tetanus shots can cause localized reactions, such as redness, swelling, and lymph node enlargement, especially in the area near the injection site. This is a common and usually harmless side effect.\n\nThe lymph node above your clavicle, also known as the supraclavicular lymph node, can be sensitive to infections, inflammation, or other stimuli in the body. In your case, the recent cat scratch, antibiotic treatment, and tetanus vaccination could all contribute to some degree of lymph node reactivity.\n\nWhile it's understandable that you're concerned about your low lymphocyte count and slightly elevated liver value, these factors don't necessarily mean that the lump is related to a serious underlying condition. Your doctor will be able to assess the lump and your overall health during your upcoming appointment.\n\nTo put your mind at ease, here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Tetanus shot reactions are common:** As mentioned earlier, localized reactions to tetanus vaccinations are not uncommon. These reactions usually resolve on their own within a few days to a week.\n2. **Lymph node swelling can be benign:** Swollen lymph nodes can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, vaccinations, and even minor injuries. In many cases, they are not a cause for concern.\n3. **Your doctor is aware of your medical history:** Your endocrinologist is already monitoring your Graves' disease and lymphocyte count. Your doctor will take your medical history into account when evaluating the lump.\n\nIn summary, while it's essential to have the lump checked by your doctor, it's possible that the tetanus shot is the cause of the swelling and lump. Try to stay calm and focus on your upcoming appointment, where your doctor can assess the situation and provide you with personalized guidance and reassurance.\n\nFeel better soon, and please do follow up with your doctor as planned."

        "question": "I (22m) currently am on Vimpat and Phenobarbital for epilepsy, which I take twice a day. This morning however, my alarm decided to only vibrate instead of actually going off in order to wake me up to take my meds. So I was 3 hours late in taking them. I know that Vimpat is already pretty much out of your system in 12 hours, which worries me that I took it after 15 hours this morning. I have a bunch of important things to do all this week (some of which involve a lot of driving) and I\u2019m now worried about any breakthrough seizures. So my question is, should I be worried or expect something to happen? And when will I know that I am in the clear and nothing will happen due to me being late on a dose?Side note: I did call my doctor and ask this already, but I\u2019m currently waiting on a call back response, which sometimes takes hours, so I figured I would ask on here as well.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general guidance based on the information you've provided.\n\nMissing a dose or taking it late can be concerning, especially when it comes to medications like Vimpat (lacosamide) and Phenobarbital, which are used to manage epilepsy. The fact that Vimpat has a relatively short half-life of around 13 hours means that its levels in your system can drop significantly if a dose is missed or delayed.\n\nBeing 3 hours late with your morning dose, and effectively 15 hours since your last dose, may increase the risk of breakthrough seizures. However, it's essential to note that every individual's response to medication and seizure thresholds can vary greatly.\n\nGiven your situation, it's understandable that you're worried about the potential for breakthrough seizures, especially with important activities planned, including driving. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Increased Risk Period**: The risk of seizures might be higher during the period when the medication levels are lower in your system, which, in your case, could be considered the time before you took your late dose and possibly for a few hours after, until the medications reach effective levels again.\n\n2. **Variable Seizure Threshold**: Your personal seizure threshold\u2014how likely you are to have a seizure\u2014can be influenced by many factors, including sleep, stress, and, of course, medication levels. Being late with a dose increases the risk, but it doesn't guarantee a seizure will occur.\n\n3. **Driving and Safety**: Given the potential increased risk of seizures, it might be prudent to be cautious with activities that could put you or others at risk, such as driving. If possible, consider alternative arrangements for driving or postpone non-essential activities that could pose a risk until you've had a chance to discuss your situation with your doctor.\n\n4. **Waiting to Hear Back from Your Doctor**: Since you've already reached out to your doctor, waiting for their advice is the best course of action. They can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history, the specifics of your medication regimen, and any other relevant factors.\n\n5. **General Guidance on When You Might Be \"in the Clear\"**: Generally, after taking a missed dose, it may take a few hours for the medication to reach therapeutic levels in your system again. However, this can vary depending on several factors, including the specific medications, your metabolism, and how you respond to the medications. Your doctor can offer more specific advice on what to expect and when you might consider yourself \"in the clear.\"\n\nIn the meantime, ensure you're well-rested, stay hydrated, and try to manage stress, as these factors can also influence seizure risk. If you experience any signs of a potential seizure or concerns about your condition, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nRemember, this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Your doctor's guidance, once you receive it, should be followed closely, as they can provide advice tailored to your specific situation and medical history."

Currently on Lamotrigine, Folic acid, Vitamin D, B12 injections.In the last few months I've had some debilitating health issues and, in the process of figuring out what the hell is happening to me, I just learned that my FSH is 122.2 miu/ml. My pcp has ordered estrogen levels to be checked and says we'll have to retest everything in a month to confirm a diagnosis of premature menopause. I just turned 28. I haven't menstruated in 6 months, so what are the chances that my reproductive organs will spontaneously start working again? What could cause this? And is there anything I should be worried about or does this just happen sometimes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm troubled to hear about your health concerns. Premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian failure or insufficiency, is a condition where the ovaries stop functioning and hormone levels decrease before the age of 40. An FSH level of 122.2 miu/ml is significantly elevated, which can indicate that your ovaries are not producing enough estrogen, leading to the symptoms you're experiencing.\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to premature menopause:\n1. **Genetics**: Family history can play a role in premature menopause.\n2. **Autoimmune disorders**: Conditions like thyroid disease or rheumatoid arthritis can increase the risk.\n3. **Infections**: Certain infections, such as mumps, can affect the ovaries.\n4. **Medical treatments**: Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can damage the ovaries.\n5. **Surgery**: Removal of the ovaries or other surgeries in the pelvic area can lead to premature menopause.\n6. **Chromosomal abnormalities**: Certain genetic conditions can affect ovarian function.\n\nRegarding the possibility of your reproductive organs starting to work again, spontaneous recovery can occur but is more common in women with intermittent ovarian function rather than those with consistently high FSH levels. However, every case is unique, and only time and further testing will provide a clearer picture of your situation.\n\nGiven your history of epilepsy, asthma, vitamin deficiencies, and current medications, it's essential to discuss with your doctor how these factors might be influencing your current hormonal situation. For instance, some antiepileptic drugs can affect hormonal balances.\n\nConcerns to discuss with your healthcare provider include:\n- **Bone health**: Low estrogen levels can increase the risk of osteoporosis.\n- **Cardiovascular health**: Estrogen has protective effects on the heart.\n- **Mood and cognitive changes**: Hormonal shifts can affect mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.\n- **Fertility options**: If you desire future pregnancy, discussing options like egg freezing or other fertility preservation methods may be necessary.\n\nIt's crucial to follow up with your healthcare provider for further testing and to discuss your specific situation, treatment options (like hormone replacement therapy), and any potential lifestyle changes that might be beneficial. Additionally, seeking a specialist, such as an endocrinologist or a reproductive endocrinologist, might provide further insight and guidance tailored to your condition."

I used to full on turn on autocorrect on my phone but nowadays I find myself almost completely depending on my phones autocorrect and looking up word spellings when even my phone can\u2019t tell what I\u2019m trying to say.    with writing again, for some reason I find myself forgetting or I don\u2019t know, not using simple words such as \u201cthe\u201d \u201cof\u201d \u201cto\u201d \u201cand\u201d \u201cfrom\u201d etc. or sometimes mistaking one word for another when there\u2019s no connection between the two    same thing as above but with speech.

I\u2019ll forget my keys, go back and get them, get there and forget what I was going to get or sometimes I\u2019ll forget I forgot.

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general insights and potential explanations for the symptoms you're experiencing. It's essential to consult a neurologist or a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized advice.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to experience cognitive and linguistic difficulties, especially if they have a high frequency of seizures or have been experiencing seizures for an extended period. The symptoms you've described, such as difficulty with writing, spelling, and speech, could be related to several factors:\r\n\r\n1. **Seizure-related cognitive impairment**: Repeated seizures can cause damage to the brain, particularly in areas responsible for language processing, memory, and executive functions. This might lead to difficulties with word retrieval, spelling, and sentence formation.\r\n2. **Epilepsy-related neuroplasticity changes**: The brain's attempt to compensate for the abnormal electrical activity caused by seizures can lead to changes in the way it processes information. This might result in difficulties with language, memory, and other cognitive functions.\r\n3. **Medication side effects**: Although you mentioned that medications didn't work for you and were stopped, some medications can have long-term effects on cognitive function, even after they've been discontinued.\r\n4. **Underlying neurological condition**: In some cases, epilepsy can be a symptom of an underlying neurological condition, such as a brain injury, tumor, or neurodegenerative disease, which could be contributing to your cognitive and linguistic difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe cluster seizures you've experienced, including the episodes where you stopped breathing, are a concern and may indicate a more severe underlying condition. It's crucial to discuss these episodes with your neurologist to determine the best course of action.\r\n\r\nRegarding your specific symptoms:\r\n\r\n* **Writing and spelling difficulties**: This could be related to difficulties with language processing, working memory, or executive functions. You might benefit from cognitive training or working with a speech-language pathologist to improve your writing and spelling skills.\r\n* **Forgetting simple words and grammatical structures**: This might be related to difficulties with language retrieval, working memory, or attention. Strategies like using mnemonics, practicing language exercises, or using assistive technology (e.g., text-to-speech software) might help.\r\n* **Speech difficulties**: The \"stuck\" sensation you experience while speaking could be related to difficulties with language processing, articulation, or fluency. A speech-language pathologist can help you address these issues and develop strategies to improve your communication.\r\n* **Increased forgetfulness**: This might be related to difficulties with working memory, attention, or episodic memory. Strategies like using memory aids (e.g., reminders, calendars), practicing memory exercises, or using assistive technology (e.g., voice assistants) might help.\r\n\r\nTo address your concerns, I recommend the following:\r\n\r\n1. **Schedule a follow-up appointment with your neurologist**: Discuss your symptoms, cluster seizures, and concerns about cognitive and linguistic difficulties. Your neurologist may recommend further testing, such as EEG, MRI, or cognitive assessments, to better understand the underlying causes of your symptoms.\r\n2. **Consider cognitive rehabilitation**: A cognitive rehabilitation program can help you develop strategies to improve your cognitive and linguistic abilities, such as attention, memory, language, and executive functions.\r\n3. **Speech-language pathology evaluation**: A speech-language pathologist can assess your language abilities and provide personalized recommendations to improve your communication skills.\r\n4. **Keep a seizure diary**: Tracking your seizures, including the frequency, duration, and any potential triggers, can help your neurologist better understand your condition and make informed decisions about your treatment.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to address your concerns and develop a comprehensive plan to manage your epilepsy and related symptoms."

I'm curious if there should be any hidden Long-term Health effects caused by my consumption of that much keppra that may not be obvious such as kidney, liver, or brain problems. Additionally, I am curious how likely it is I would have died from consuming that much Keppra and if a death from keppra would be painful.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Swallowing 42 grams of Keppra, an anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy and other seizure disorders, is a significant overdose. Fortunately, you were able to vomit and then fell asleep, waking up feeling relatively normal.\n\nRegarding potential long-term health effects, it's essential to consider the impact of such a large dose on your internal organs. While you may not be experiencing any obvious symptoms now, there are some concerns to be aware of:\n\n*   **Kidney function:** Keppra is primarily excreted through the kidneys. An overdose can put a significant strain on the kidneys, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or worsening existing kidney problems. Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor kidney function would be advisable.\n*   **Liver function:** While Keppra is not known to cause significant liver damage, an overdose can still affect liver function. Your doctor may recommend periodic liver function tests to ensure everything is within normal limits.\n*   **Brain and neurological effects:** As Keppra is a central nervous system depressant, an overdose can cause cognitive impairments, such as memory problems, difficulty concentrating, or mood changes. In some cases, long-term use or overdose of Keppra can lead to suicidal thoughts or behaviors. If you experience any unusual neurological symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nAs for the likelihood of death from consuming 42 grams of Keppra, it's difficult to provide an exact probability. However, Keppra overdose can be life-threatening, especially if not treated promptly.\n\nSymptoms of a severe Keppra overdose may include:\n\n*   Respiratory depression\n*   Cardiac arrest\n*   Seizures\n*   Coma\n\nIf a death were to occur from a Keppra overdose, it would likely be due to respiratory depression or cardiac arrest. The experience of death from Keppra overdose is not well-documented, but it's unlikely to be painful, as the medication can cause significant sedation and reduced consciousness.\n\nConsult with a medical professional as soon as possible. They can assess your overall health, discuss potential long-term effects, and provide guidance on any necessary follow-up care."

        "question": "TL:DR - Need answers about my 10 year old cousin who is suffering from migraines and seizure like symptoms, yet doctors claim it is not related to epilepsy and cannot find diagnoses.My 10 year old cousin who is probably around 4.3 feet and weights around 75 ibs, Fiona, (not her real name but for privacy\u2019s sake...) has been having this ever since New Year\u2019s Day 2021. It all started when she was having headaches or migraines. She started taking medications, and apparently she was having them per every fours hours.Then on February 15, I got a text from another cousin saying that Fiona was in the hospital due to her passing out, her legs feeling numb, and not being able to move. The doctors say that it\u2019s probably due to the medication being taken too often. She was later sent back home since she got better. She stopped taking the migraine medications anymore, but then things got worse.She then started having some kind of seizure-like episodes. In these episodes she started shaking, twitching, having migraines from light sensitivity, trouble breathing, and that she feels hot. They last over 10 minutes and she has them up to 10 times a day or even more. She also has them in specific time periods such as 6:30 PM.When we called 911 and sent her to the hospital, she had to keep going back-and-forth and that this has happened five times due to doctors not being able to diagnose her (even though they had witnessed her symptoms). They keep saying things that we are sure that it is not true. Here are the things that they said:\u201c The episodes that she is having are not seizures.\u201c \u201cIt is probably from depression or some psychological problems.\u201d (my cousin has never suffered from depression or anything like that) The first time that I witnessed one of Fiona\u2018s episodes in real life was during when we were having a welcoming back party for her. This episode lasted 50 minutes due to the fact that we cannot stand having this back-and-forth situation. It is absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating knowing we could not do anything. It has gone to the point that they have to go to Philadelphia (I assume they have better doctors over there), and they still said that it\u2019s probably due to the medication. She is currently back home and still suffering from this. Again, I\u2019m pretty sure that my cousin is not on any harsh medication whatsoever. All she is actually taking is Tylenol, and it is in moderation. So I am concerned as to if symptoms like this can last this long. In the end I know that this forum is not a place to find a diagnosis, but I hope that I can find an answer here. Just a little piece of assumption of what could she is going through can help my family get through this hard time.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I can sense the frustration and concern you and your family are going through. I'll do my best to provide some insights and possible explanations, but please keep in mind that a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified medical professional.\n\nFiona's symptoms are indeed alarming, and it's understandable that you're seeking answers. Based on what you've shared, here are a few potential possibilities:\n\n1. **Complex Migraines**: Although the doctors have ruled out epilepsy, Fiona's symptoms, such as migraine headaches, light sensitivity, and twitching, could be related to complex migraines. These types of migraines can cause a range of symptoms, including sensory disturbances, motor symptoms, and even seizures-like episodes.\n2. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**: Some children with mitochondrial disorders can experience seizures, migraines, and other neurological symptoms. Although this is a rare condition, it's possible that Fiona might be experiencing mitochondrial dysfunction, which could be contributing to her symptoms.\n3. **Neurological conditions**: Other conditions like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, absences, or even a rare condition like **Hashimoto's encephalopathy** (which can cause seizures, migraines, and other neurological symptoms) might be worth exploring.\n4. **Autoimmune disorders**: Conditions like **PANDAS** (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections) or **Mooren's ulcer** (a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause seizures and migraines) could be potential underlying causes.\n5. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as **hypoglycemia**, **hyperthyroidism**, or **anemia**, can cause symptoms similar to what Fiona is experiencing.\n\nRegarding the doctors' claims that the episodes are not seizures, it's possible that they might be correct, but it's also possible that they're misinterpreting the symptoms. The fact that Fiona's episodes are predictable (occurring at 6:30 PM) and last for an extended period could suggest a pattern that needs to be further investigated.\n\nThe suggestion that Fiona's symptoms are related to depression or psychological problems seems unlikely, given her age and the absence of any prior mental health issues.\n\nTo move forward, I recommend:\n\n1. **Seeking a second (or third) opinion**: Consider consulting a pediatric neurologist or a specialist in headache disorders to get a fresh perspective on Fiona's case.\n2. **Keeping a detailed symptom journal**: Documenting the frequency, duration, and triggers of Fiona's episodes can help identify patterns and potential causes.\n3. **Pushing for further testing**: Request that the doctors run additional tests, such as EEGs, blood work, or imaging studies, to rule out underlying conditions that might be contributing to Fiona's symptoms.\n4. **Exploring alternative treatments**: If the current treatment plan is not effective, consider consulting with a healthcare professional about alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, or relaxation techniques, that might help manage Fiona's symptoms.\n\nRemember that every child is unique, and it may take time to find the correct diagnosis and treatment. I hope this information provides some guidance and support during this challenging time. If you have any further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask."

        "question": "Hi there.My husband underwent surgery 2 years ago to remove an encephalocele in his right temporal lobe that was causing seizures. He had no side effects and no seizures, and received permission from his neuro team to begin weaning off meds. He was completely off by March 2021. Last month I woke up to him having a tonic-clonic seizure in his sleep.Today we recieved the results of his MRI.\"There has been interval surgical repair of right tegmen mastoideum encephalocele, with new small region of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the adjacent right inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri. Amygdala and hippocampi are otherwise relatively symmetric with normal signal and configuration.No evidence of mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus elsewhere in the brain.\"Our next appointment with his neurologist is in a week but it feels like a millenia. We are trying to understand so we can prepare ourselves for possible courses of treatment.Is ANY amount of encephalomalacia/gliosis expected following a lesionectomy? Does this result suggest he may just need additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures, or are we going to be exploring the possibility of another surgery?  Anything you can offer would help put my mind at ease.Demographics: 34yo male, healthy nonsmoker (6'2, 175lb). Craniosynostosis confirmed (IL11RA variant) and consequently underwent craniofacial reconstructive surgery at age 16. Diagnosed with right temporal lobe epilepsy at age 30. Encephalocele removed from temporal lobe and with medication patient was seizure free for 2 years. July 2021 MRI details new encephalomalacia/glioma near the resection site. Currently on 400mg Vimpat for epilepsy. No other health concerns.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll try to provide some insights to help you better understand the MRI results and possible implications.\n\n**Encephalomalacia and Gliosis:**\n\nEncephalomalacia refers to the softening or loss of brain tissue, often due to injury, infection, or inflammation. Gliosis is the proliferation of glial cells, which are a type of non-neuronal cell in the brain, in response to injury or disease. In the context of a lesionectomy (surgical removal of a brain lesion), some degree of encephalomalacia and gliosis is expected, as the surrounding brain tissue may be affected by the surgical procedure.\n\nHowever, the extent and significance of this expected encephalomalacia and gliosis can vary greatly. In your husband's case, the MRI report mentions a \"new small region\" of encephalomalacia and gliosis, which suggests that it may be a relatively localized and limited process.\n\n**Interpretation of MRI results:**\n\nThe MRI report appears to be relatively reassuring, as it:\n\n1. Confirms the successful surgical repair of the encephalocele.\n2. Does not show any evidence of a new mass, suspicious enhancement, or epileptogenic focus (a region in the brain that can generate seizures) elsewhere in the brain.\n3. Indicates that the amygdala and hippocampi, which are structures involved in seizure generation, are relatively symmetric and have a normal signal and configuration.\n\nHowever, the presence of encephalomalacia and gliosis near the resection site may suggest that there is some ongoing injury or inflammation in that area, which could be contributing to the recurrence of seizures.\n\n**Possible courses of treatment:**\n\nBased on the MRI results, it's possible that your husband may require additional support from pharmaceuticals to control seizures. The fact that he has already been seizure-free for 2 years and had a good response to medication suggests that medication adjustments or additions might be effective in managing his seizures.\n\nThe neurologist may consider:\n\n1. Adjusting the dosage or type of antiepileptic medication (e.g., increasing the Vimpat dose or adding another medication).\n2. Monitoring your husband's seizure activity and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly.\n\nAnother surgery is not necessarily a foregone conclusion at this point. However, if your husband's seizures are not well-controlled with medication, or if the encephalomalacia and gliosis worsen, further surgical evaluation might be considered.\n\n**Craniosynostosis and IL11RA variant:**\n\nIt's worth noting that your husband's history of craniosynostosis and the IL11RA variant may be relevant to his brain development and function. However, it's not clear how this might be related to his current seizure activity or the encephalomalacia and gliosis.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nIt's essential to discuss the MRI results and possible courses of treatment with your husband's neurologist. They can provide more specific guidance and recommendations based on their expertise and your husband's individual situation.\n\nIn preparation for the appointment, you may want to:\n\n1. Write down any questions or concerns you have.\n2. Bring a copy of the MRI report and any relevant medical records.\n3. Discuss your husband's seizure history, including the frequency, severity, and any potential triggers.\n4. Ask about the potential risks and benefits of different treatment options.\n\nRemember that it's normal to feel anxious or concerned when dealing with a complex medical situation. Try to take things one step at a time, and focus on getting the best possible care for your husband."

Thanks to all the doctors who visit this sub and offer help!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What a fascinating and detailed account of your experiences! I'll do my best to provide you with information on synesthesia and its potential relation to your situation.\n\n**What is synesthesia?**\n\nSynesthesia is a neurological condition where stimulation of one sensory pathway leads to an automatic, involuntary experience in another sensory pathway. For example, seeing numbers or letters in specific colors (grapheme-color synesthesia) or tasting specific flavors when hearing certain words (lexical-gustatory synesthesia). Synesthesia is a legitimate neurological phenomenon, and research has confirmed its existence through various studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and behavioral experiments.\n\n**Your experiences**\n\nYour descriptions of \"feeling things you see\" and experiencing sensations, smells, or emotions in response to visual stimuli are intriguing and resemble synesthetic experiences. The fact that these sensations started after your epilepsy was controlled and you hadn't experienced them before suggests a possible link between your brain's rewiring and the development of synesthesia.\n\n**Research on synesthesia**\n\nStudies have shown that synesthesia is a genuine perceptual phenomenon, not a product of imagination or suggestion. Neuroimaging studies have identified differences in brain structure and function between synesthetes and non-synesthetes, particularly in areas involved in sensory processing, attention, and memory. Synesthesia has been linked to increased cross-talk between brain regions, which may lead to the blending of sensory experiences.\n\n**Possible explanations for your experiences**\n\nGiven your history of epilepsy and the control of seizures, it's possible that your brain has undergone some reorganization, leading to the emergence of synesthetic experiences. This could be related to:\n\n1. **Neuroplasticity**: The brain's ability to reorganize itself in response to changes, such as the control of seizures, may have led to the development of new connections between brain areas, resulting in synesthetic experiences.\n2. **Cross-talk between brain regions**: The increased communication between brain areas, such as those involved in sensory processing and emotion, may contribute to the blending of sensory experiences.\n3. **Default mode network**: The default mode network, which is active during introspection and mind-wandering, may be more active in your brain, leading to the experience of sensations and emotions in response to visual stimuli.\n\n**Is synesthesia a mental disorder?**\n\nSynesthesia is not considered a mental disorder in the classical sense. While it can be unsettling or confusing, especially if you're not familiar with it, synesthesia is generally a benign condition that does not interfere with daily life or cognitive function. In fact, many synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant and enriching.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile it's impossible to say for certain without further evaluation, your experiences are consistent with synesthesia. It's essential to continue monitoring your symptoms and discussing them with your neurologist and other healthcare professionals to rule out any potential underlying conditions that may need attention. However, it's unlikely that your experiences are a sign of a mental disorder or a downward turn in your mental health.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. **Continue to discuss your experiences with your neurologist**: Share your observations and any changes in your experiences to better understand their nature and potential relationship to your epilepsy and brain function.\n2. **Explore synesthesia resources**: Learn more about synesthesia, its different types, and the experiences of other synesthetes to gain a deeper understanding of your own experiences.\n3. **Enjoy your synesthetic experiences**: If you find your experiences pleasant and enriching, embrace them as a unique aspect of your perceptual world.\n\nI hope this information helps you better understand your experiences and alleviates any concerns you may have. Thank you for sharing your fascinating story, and I'm glad to have been able to help!"

This is a good thing, as it allows the radiologist to see if there have been any changes in your brain over time.\n\n**Technique:**\nThe MRI technique used is a standard one, which involves taking multiple images of the brain from different angles (multiplanar) and using various sequences (multisequence) to get a comprehensive view of the brain. No contrast agent was used, which is also a standard approach for many brain MRI exams.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n* **No acute hemorrhage or infarction:** This is good news! The MRI didn't show any signs of recent bleeding (hemorrhage) or stroke (infarction) in the brain.\n* **No mass effect or edema:** This means that there are no large masses (like tumors) or areas of swelling (edema) in the brain that could be causing problems.\n* **No significant atrophy or chronic microvascular ischemic changes:** Atrophy refers to shrinkage of brain tissue, which can occur with aging or certain diseases. The report says that there's no significant atrophy, which is good. Microvascular ischemic changes refer to damage to small blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to chronic problems. The report says that there's no significant evidence of this.\n* **Few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality on the right:** This is the part of the report that might be causing you anxiety. I'll break it down:\n\t+ \"Few punctate foci\" means that there are a small number of tiny spots (foci) in the brain.\n\t+ \"T2/FLAIR white matter signal abnormality\" refers to changes in the white matter of the brain, which is the tissue that carries signals between different brain cells. The T2/FLAIR sequence is a specific type of MRI image that's sensitive to changes in white matter.\n\t+ \"On the right\" means that these tiny spots are located in the right hemisphere of the brain.\n\n**Impression:**\nThe radiologist's impression is that these tiny spots (punctate foci) might be related to:\n\n* **Microvascular ischemic change:** This refers to damage to small blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to chronic problems. However, the radiologist notes that this is not the only possible explanation.\n* **Demyelinating disease not excluded:** Demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), are conditions where the protective covering (myelin) of nerve fibers is damaged. The radiologist is saying that they can't rule out the possibility of a demyelinating disease, but they're not definitely saying that you have one either.\n\n**What does this mean for you?**\nIt's essential to discuss the MRI report with your doctor or a neurologist to get a better understanding of what these findings might mean in your specific case. They will consider your medical history, including your epilepsy, migraines, and headaches, as well as your current symptoms and medications.\n\nIn general, the presence of a few punctate foci of white matter signal abnormality on the right might not be immediately concerning, but it's something that your doctor will want to monitor. They may recommend follow-up MRIs or other tests to see how these changes evolve over time.\n\nKeep in mind that you have a history of epilepsy, which can sometimes be associated with white matter changes in the brain. However, the radiologist's impression suggests that there might be other factors at play, such as microvascular ischemic changes or a demyelinating disease.\n\nI hope this explanation helps alleviate some anxiety. Remember to discuss the report with your doctor to get a better understanding of what it means for your specific situation."

        "question": "23M, 6\u20195 and wondering if liquid nytol is okay to use with a very mild form of epilepsy (no seizures) that is triggered by light.On no other medications but have ADHD and anxiety and can\u2019t sleep anymore",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information that might be helpful. If you're considering using Liquid Nytol for sleep issues while having a mild form of epilepsy (without seizures) triggered by light, ADHD, and anxiety, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider or a neurologist. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition and medical history.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Liquid Nytol is a brand of diphenhydramine, an antihistamine that can cause drowsiness. While it might help with sleep, it's essential to consider the potential interactions and side effects, especially with your conditions.\r\n\r\nFor epilepsy, even if it's mild and triggered by light, it's vital to be cautious with any new medication, including over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids like Liquid Nytol. Some antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, can potentially lower the seizure threshold, although this is more commonly associated with higher doses or in people with a history of seizures.\r\n\r\nGiven your ADHD and anxiety, you might want to discuss alternative sleep strategies with your healthcare provider, such as:\r\n\r\n1. **Establishing a consistent sleep schedule\r\n2. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine\r\n3. Avoiding screens and stimulating activities before bedtime\r\n4. Practicing relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation\r\n5. Considering cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)\r\n\r\nIf medication is still an option, your healthcare provider might recommend prescription sleep aids or other alternatives that are safer for someone with your conditions.\r\n\r\nIn any case, please consult with your healthcare provider before taking Liquid Nytol or any other sleep aid. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks and suggest the best course of action for your specific situation.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health, especially with conditions like epilepsy."

        "question": " 50F in Australia, on carbimazole and levetiracetam for Graves\u2019 and epilepsy, respectively. FOOSH injury of the wrist.I tripped over some uneven pavement while running last night and fell on my hands. I got some road rash on one hand, and both instantly went numb. As the numbness wore off, one had was fine, but the other has pain. It hurts to grip things, and most of the pain is near the base of my thumb. Some pain radiates down the inside of my wrist. It\u2019s not horribly painful but was enough to disrupt my sleep a lot last night, because I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position for my wrist. It also sent a shooting pain when I tried to use my thumb to press the button on my electric toothbrush.I\u2019ve called a local medical centre, and their radiology office is closed for the weekend. They recommended going to the ED if I want an X-ray, but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s that urgent. It\u2019s Saturday here now. Is it ok to wait for Monday, or is there any reason I should get it imaged right away?Here\u2019s the damage to the palm of my hand.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll provide some general guidance. It's great that you're considering the urgency of your situation. Given your symptoms, it's possible that you might have a wrist injury, such as a scaphoid fracture or a sprain, especially with the pain radiating to the base of your thumb and the inside of your wrist.\n\nWhile it's understandable that you might not want to visit the Emergency Department (ED) unless absolutely necessary, it's essential to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Scaphoid fracture risk**: The scaphoid bone is prone to fractures, especially with a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH injury). If left untreated, a scaphoid fracture can lead to complications like nonunion or avascular necrosis.\n2. **Wrist instability**: If you have a significant sprain or ligament injury, it may require prompt attention to prevent further instability or chronic issues.\n3. **Your medical history**: As someone with Graves' disease and epilepsy, you might be at a higher risk for osteoporosis or bone health issues, which could affect the severity of your injury.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's reasonable to err on the side of caution. While it's not necessarily an emergency, I would recommend getting your wrist imaged as soon as possible, rather than waiting until Monday.\n\nYou have a few options:\n\n* Visit the ED, as recommended by the medical centre, to get an X-ray and have a medical professional assess your wrist.\n* If you're not comfortable with the ED, you could try contacting an urgent care centre or a sports medicine clinic (if available in your area) to see if they can provide an X-ray and initial assessment.\n* If you still prefer to wait until Monday, make sure to keep your wrist immobilized and iced to reduce discomfort and potential further injury. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers, like paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help manage your symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to potential bone or ligament injuries. If you're unsure or concerned, it's always best to consult with a medical professional for personalized advice.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for professional medical advice, and you should consult with a doctor or medical professional for a proper assessment and diagnosis."

        "question": "Epilepsy and lamictal 44 year old female. 215 pounds. Non smoker. Epilepsy. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, since my early 20\u2019s. I would have one maybe a year or so. I started lamictal xr 200mg. First time on meds. Things got better but I still had them. Fast forward to 2019 October I had three in one month. I had my blood levels checked by pcp and neuro. At that point I was on lamictal xr 400mg. My levels have always been around 9ish. These 3 were checked the same time of day. 8/29/19 7.1 10/31/19 6.3 After I changed to newer bottles it was 11/22/19 9.2 These levels were checked because I pushed it. I had this history of always having these pinching headaches in the morning only. I addressed it with my regular neuro that was self pay, 2 others that were through my insurance. All shrugged their shoulders and said it\u2019s fine. When I saw that the 10/31 dropped to 6.3 I for fun decided to start my lamictal bottles that had a later expiration date. The ones I was taking were expiring in 6 months so I went to ones that expiring in 2 years from them. The second opinion neuro said they are actually still good 6 months after expiry. I\u2019m doing better after I changed my bottles out. My regular neuro said that even though expiry date has not passed and that it was older bottles to toss all those and use the newer ones. He used to write double dosage due to saving money so I had a bunch. He had wanted me to increase to 600mg xr but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of making things worse. In April 2020 I finally did and I was in heaven. Morning headaches went away and I was so happy. My neuro shrugged his shoulders and said ok. I thought I was in the clear but I had one in October 2020 most likely due to my recklessly getting less sleep and being under marital stress. I thought great it\u2019s been a year and due to my issues I won\u2019t let it happen again. Now fast forward to June 2021 I had another one. I\u2019m back to bad sleep and marital stress again. I have not had my levels checked but now after that seizure I\u2019m starting to have headaches in the morning. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m stressed again of it happening again maybe because my problems In life haven\u2019t gotten better. My current meds expire a year from now. August 2022. My neuro had explained back then that even though when they were 6 months from expiry it\u2019s possible that there is a somewhat of a decrease in the lamictal that for me it\u2019s pushed me to the edge of it not being as effective for me. So basically my thoughts are is it possible I need to throw out the ones that are one year from expiry? My new ones are June 2023 and I haven\u2019t started those yet. At the nov 2019 visit he first said maybe it\u2019s time of day or fluke but when I told him what I did with newer bottles he then seemed to think the 6 months from expiry were ones that I should throw out even though technically they should be still ok to use. He said let\u2019s say they were manufactured 5 years from expiry that the effectiveness for me is not as good anymore compared to the newer bottles. I haven\u2019t contacted my neuro yet but will be this week. Will see if he\u2019s changed his thoughts on that and maybe he will say one year should be ok and maybe it\u2019s a me thing and nothing to do with my meds. To save money I was trying to finish the ones that expire next year but I would throw those out if a doc thought I should and start new ones. Also odd question. I take xr600 mg a day. Three 200mg pills a day. The new ones will be two xr300mg a day. Would this have any effect blood levels because they are xr and the coating melts at different rate. If they weren\u2019t xr I wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I haven\u2019t swapped them out to see if the headaches will go away because I was thinking I shouldn\u2019t change the way the dosage is delivered. I just think it was odd. I have 3 seizures in one month and levels dropped. I change to newer bottles and levels go back up again. Also when I started the 600mg dose last year my levels were checked once and they were 12. After this long post my question is should I throw the ones out that expire next year? I won\u2019t be able to get my levels checked anytime soon to see if they have dropped. If you\u2019ve made it this far thanks for reading. Edit the bottles were stored in my dresser. And they were in original manufacture bottle from galxosmithklein gsk",

        "answer": "I'll try to break down your concerns and provide some insights.\n\n**Summary of your situation:**\n\n* You have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and have been taking Lamictal XR (lamotrigine) 600mg daily since 2019.\n* You've experienced fluctuations in seizure frequency and blood levels, which seem to be related to changes in your medication bottles and expiration dates.\n* You're wondering if the medication's effectiveness decreases over time, even before the expiration date, and if you should discard the bottles that expire in August 2022.\n* You're also curious about the potential impact of switching from three 200mg XR pills to two 300mg XR pills on your blood levels.\n\n**Medication stability and expiration dates:**\n\n* The expiration date on a medication bottle is the manufacturer's guarantee of the drug's potency and stability up to that date.\n* The FDA allows a 5-year expiration date for most medications, including Lamictal, if stored properly.\n* However, the actual shelf life of a medication can be longer or shorter, depending on various factors, such as storage conditions, packaging, and individual medication characteristics.\n* The fact that your neurologist suggested discarding the older bottles, even though they were still within the expiration date, might indicate that he believes the medication's effectiveness decreases over time, especially for you, as an individual.\n\n**Effect of storage conditions:**\n\n* You mentioned storing the bottles in your dresser, which is a relatively stable environment.\n* However, it's essential to note that medications should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.\n* If the bottles were exposed to extreme temperatures, humidity, or light, it could affect the medication's stability.\n\n**Switching from 200mg to 300mg XR pills:**\n\n* The extended-release (XR) formulation of Lamictal is designed to release the medication slowly over time.\n* While the switch from three 200mg XR pills to two 300mg XR pills might seem like a significant change, the total daily dose remains the same (600mg).\n* The XR coating is designed to ensure a consistent release rate, but it's possible that individual factors, such as stomach acidity or gut motility, could affect the medication's absorption.\n* However, it's unlikely that the switch from 200mg to 300mg XR pills would have a significant impact on your blood levels, as the total daily dose and XR formulation remain the same.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on your history and concerns, it's reasonable to consider discarding the older bottles that expire in August 2022, especially if you've experienced a return of symptoms (headaches and seizures) that might be related to a decrease in medication effectiveness.\nHowever, it's essential to consult your neurologist before making any changes to your medication regimen. They can assess your individual situation, review your medical history, and provide guidance on the best course of action.\nIf your neurologist agrees that the older bottles might be less effective, you can consider switching to the newer bottles that expire in June 2023.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n* Schedule a consultation with your neurologist to discuss your concerns and determine the best course of action.\n* Be prepared to provide detailed information about your medication history, storage conditions, and any changes in your symptoms or seizure frequency.\n* Ask your neurologist about the potential impact of switching to the newer bottles and the 300mg XR pills on your blood levels and overall treatment plan.\n\nI hope this helps you navigate your situation. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!"

        "question": "My friend's brother just had a baby several days ago. The mom is in her mid 30s, third time mom, healthy. They have 2 completely healthy kids. The pregnancy was good, although the baby was born about a week after due date. The mom was in hospital during that period as she had contractions periodically but they said there wasn't a need to induce her. She delivered a (seemingly) healthy girl on june 27th (due date was june 19th).While she was in hospital, everything seemed great. When my friend and her brother went to pick the mom and baby up from the hospital yesterday, the baby had a mild seizure while the nurses were doing the final check-up. However, it was dismissed and the baby was allowed to go.Just mere hours after the baby got home, she had two more seizures in the span of 3 hours. The first was around 5pm and the second was around 8pm, after which they took the baby to the hospital. They ran some tests and decided to keep her for the night. She had another seizure in the morning, a stronger one, and it was witnessed by a doctor. The doctor was pretty concerned and ordered some other tests. The brain scan and reflexes were good, brain activity was good. They decided to keep her anyway, just to keep an eye on her. The baby was finally seen by a neurologist this afternoon. The neurologist is an older woman, they say she's very experienced in neonatal care. She basically said that it's nothing, that it happens all the time, that the mom was probably hungry, cold and/or scared so she was shaking during delivery which somehow transfered the shakiness to the baby and it manifested as a seizure (3 days later?). Now, I'm absolutely NOT a doctor, much less an experienced neurologist, but this honestly smells like BS. I also don't have kids and have never given birth. Is this possible? My friend and her family are holding onto what this woman said and I definitely don't want to be skeptical, but I really can't help it. It just sounds so impossible to me and the fact that it happened 3 times in the 24 hours the baby was released just makes me believe that the hospital is trying to save itself from a lawsuit.  Can any doctor, nurse, mother, anyone who had or has heard of a similar experience tell me their opinion? Because I truly wish I could believe it, but I simply don't. Even though the test results are good so far.",

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll provide you with a neutral, informative response based on general medical knowledge. It's essential to note that every medical case is unique, and only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a accurate diagnosis and explanation.\n\nThe scenario you described is concerning, and it's natural to have questions and doubts. Seizures in newborns can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. **Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy**: Lack of oxygen to the brain during delivery, which can cause seizures.\n2. **Infection**: Bacterial or viral infections, such as meningitis or sepsis, can lead to seizures.\n3. **Metabolic disorders**: Issues with blood sugar, electrolytes, or other metabolic processes can cause seizures.\n4. **Structural brain abnormalities**: Congenital conditions, such as cerebral malformations, can increase the risk of seizures.\n5. **Genetic conditions**: Certain genetic disorders, like epilepsy, can manifest in newborns.\n\nThe neurologist's explanation, attributing the seizures to the mother's potential stress, hunger, or cold during delivery, seems unlikely and oversimplified. While maternal stress and other factors can affect the baby's well-being, it's unlikely that they would cause seizures three days after birth.\n\nSeveral aspects of this case raise questions:\n\n* The seizures occurred multiple times, which suggests an underlying cause rather than a one-time event.\n* The seizures started after the baby was discharged from the hospital, which might indicate that something was missed during the initial hospital stay.\n* The brain scan and reflexes were reported as good, but other tests, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram), might be necessary to fully evaluate the baby's brain activity.\n\nIt's possible that the hospital is being cautious and trying to avoid unnecessary alarm, but it's also possible that they are not taking the situation seriously enough. The fact that the neurologist downplayed the seizures and provided an unconventional explanation might be contributing to the skepticism.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion**: It would be beneficial for the family to consult another neonatologist or a pediatric neurologist to get an independent evaluation and diagnosis.\n2. **Request additional testing**: The family should ask about further tests, such as an EEG, to rule out underlying conditions that might be causing the seizures.\n3. **Keep a seizure log**: Documenting the seizures, including the time, duration, and any potential triggers, can help healthcare professionals identify patterns and potential causes.\n4. **Stay vigilant**: The family should continue to monitor the baby's condition and report any changes or concerns to their healthcare provider.\n\nRemember that every medical case is unique, and it's essential to rely on evidence-based information and consult with qualified healthcare professionals. While it's natural to have doubts, it's crucial to prioritize the baby's health and well-being by seeking a thorough evaluation and diagnosis."

        "question": "So I'm an 18 yr old Caucasian male (62kg,180cm). Since some months ago, I have constant depersonalization/dereaalization and periods of confusion that really bother me. I went to a neurologist and had an MRI scan(which turned out fine, except for some normal anatomical variants) and I was wondering if my confusion and dpdr can be the result of epilepsy ?(non-convulsive seizures). Thanks!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're seeking help and exploring possible explanations for your symptoms! Depersonalization and derealization can be distressing and confusing (no pun intended).\n\nWhile it's great that you've had an MRI scan, which ruled out some potential structural causes, epilepsy (including non-convulsive seizures) is still a possibility that needs to be considered. However, it's essential to approach this with a nuanced understanding.\n\n**Non-convulsive seizures and depersonalization/derealization:**\n\nNon-convulsive seizures, also known as complex partial seizures or focal seizures, can manifest with a range of symptoms, including:\n\n1. Altered consciousness or awareness\n2. Confusion\n3. Disorientation\n4. Depersonalization (feeling detached from oneself)\n5. Derealization (feeling detached from the world around)\n\nThese seizures can be caused by abnormal electrical activity in specific areas of the brain, such as the temporal lobe.\n\n**However, there are a few things to consider:**\n\n1. **Frequency and duration**: Non-convulsive seizures are typically episodic, meaning they come and go. If your depersonalization and confusion are constant, it might be less likely to be related to epilepsy.\n2. **Other symptoms**: Non-convulsive seizures often involve other symptoms, such as:\n\t* Automatisms (repetitive behaviors, like lip smacking or hand movements)\n\t* Changes in mood or emotional state\n\t* Numbness or tingling sensations\n\t* Visual or auditory disturbances\n\t* Memory lapses or difficulty recalling events\nIf you're not experiencing these additional symptoms, it might be less likely to be related to epilepsy.\n3. **EEG findings**: An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a crucial test for diagnosing epilepsy. If you haven't had an EEG yet, it's essential to discuss this with your neurologist. Abnormal EEG findings, such as spike-wave discharges or focal slowing, can support a diagnosis of epilepsy.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult your neurologist**: Share your concerns and symptoms with your neurologist, and ask about the possibility of non-convulsive seizures. They may recommend:\n\t* An EEG to assess your brain's electrical activity\n\t* Video-EEG monitoring (if an EEG is inconclusive)\n\t* Other tests, like a sleep study or cognitive assessments\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Tracking your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers, can help your neurologist better understand your condition.\n3. **Explore other potential causes**: Depersonalization and derealization can be symptoms of various conditions, including:\n\t* Anxiety disorders\n\t* Depression\n\t* Trauma\n\t* Sleep disorders\n\t* Substance use or withdrawal\n\t* Other medical conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiencies)\n\nIt's essential to work with your neurologist and possibly other healthcare professionals (e.g., a psychologist or psychiatrist) to rule out other potential causes and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\nRemember, it's great that you're taking proactive steps to understand your symptoms. Stay open-minded, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if needed."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the complexity and multitude of symptoms presented, it's challenging to pinpoint a single underlying cause without a comprehensive medical evaluation. However, the combination of seizures, chronic low potassium, anemia, positive ANA, fluctuating GFR, difficulty with low glucose, small blood clots, bruising, significant pain followed by relief and bruising, visual disturbances, potential stroke symptoms, Raynaud's phenomenon, tachycardia with PVCs, aphasia, dysphagia, and joint swelling suggests an autoimmune or systemic disorder. The presence of a positive ANA, particularly with a rising titer, is indicative of an autoimmune process.\n\nGiven the initial consideration and subsequent dismissal of Lupus based on stable C3 and C4 levels, it's essential to reconsider or further investigate this diagnosis. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) can present with a wide range of symptoms, including those described, and is known for its protean manifestations. The fact that the ANA titer has increased over time (from 1:160 to 1:320) supports the possibility of an evolving autoimmune process. Lupus nephritis could explain the fluctuations in GFR, and the disease can also cause seizures, anemia, and other symptoms mentioned.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of MS was considered and cleared based on MRI findings. However, other conditions should be explored:\n\n1. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):** Given the history of small blood clots, bruising, and a significant post-partum hemorrhage, APS should be considered. This syndrome can cause clotting issues, recurrent miscarriages, and is often associated with SLE or can be primary.\n\n2. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):** This condition has features overlapping with lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis, and could potentially explain many of the symptoms, including Raynaud's phenomenon, joint swelling, and the presence of a high ANA titer.\n\n3. **Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome:** Although specific tests for Sj\u00f6gren's were negative, it's worth noting that this condition can have a wide range of systemic manifestations beyond the classic symptoms of dry eyes and mouth.\n\n4. **Vasculitis:** Conditions such as systemic vasculitis could potentially explain some of the symptoms, particularly those related to blood clots, visual disturbances, and neuropathy.\n\n5. **Mitochondrial Disorders:** Given the personal history of TBI and the onset of seizures, along with other systemic symptoms, it might be worth exploring the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder, which could affect energy production and explain the fatigue, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.\n\n6. **Other Autoimmune Disorders:** Conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis should be considered, despite the negative RA factor, as autoimmune diseases can sometimes present with atypical features.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case, a comprehensive re-evaluation by a rheumatologist, possibly in conjunction with a neurologist and nephrologist, is warranted. Further testing, including but not limited to:\n\n- Repeating lupus-specific tests (e.g., anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm) and assessing complement levels again.\n- Antiphospholipid antibodies (for APS).\n- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess for inflammation.\n- Detailed thyroid function tests.\n- Mitochondrial function tests if deemed appropriate by a specialist.\n- Consideration for a kidney biopsy if the renal issues persist or worsen.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach, thorough diagnostic workup, and possibly a referral to a specialized autoimmune disease center may be necessary to unravel the underlying causes of these diverse symptoms."

She had her first seizure (tonic-clonic) in 2009 and was diagnosed with Epilepsy which has been reasonably controlled (rarely any tonic-clonic seizures and isolated absent seizures) with Keppara and Trileptal on varying doses over the last 10 years. Her current dose is Trileptal 750mg bd and Keppara 1000mg bd. She also has medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Mum recently went to India for 6 months and after returning, has been dealing with multiple absent seizures a day where she will have a lapse of attention and mental confusion/unable to pay attention. There are also lip smacking and chewing motions also. She has accidentally injured herself during the absent seizures and they seem to occur in periods of stress/anxiety. As a result, the docs are saying there might be a psychological aspect to her epilepsy. She has most of her family overseas so has always dealt with feeling isolated and may be feeling more so since coming back from India. We are getting her in with a pyschologist in the New Year but really want to know if anyone on here can offer any advice on why the medications are no longer controlling the absent seizures and if there might be something we are missing.

        "answer": "I'll provide a comprehensive response, but please note that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with your mom's healthcare team for personalized advice.\n\n**Medication efficacy and potential reasons for increased seizures:**\n\n1. **Medication tolerance:** Long-term use of Keppra and Trileptal may lead to tolerance, reducing their effectiveness. This could be a contributing factor to the increased frequency of absent seizures.\n2. **Dosage adjustments:** The current dosage of Trileptal (750mg twice daily) and Keppra (1000mg twice daily) might not be sufficient to control the seizures, especially considering the increase in frequency and severity.\n3. **Polypharmacy:** The combination of multiple medications, including those for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, may interact with the antiepileptic drugs, reducing their efficacy or increasing the risk of side effects.\n4. **Hormonal changes:** Hormonal fluctuations, particularly estrogen, can affect seizure frequency and severity. As your mom is 45, she may be experiencing perimenopausal changes, which could contribute to the increased seizures.\n\n**Psychological aspect:**\n\n1. **Stress and anxiety:** It's well-established that stress and anxiety can trigger or exacerbate seizures, especially in people with epilepsy. The feeling of isolation, family dynamics, and adjusting to life after returning from India might be contributing to her increased stress levels.\n2. **Depression:** The psychological impact of living with epilepsy, combined with feelings of isolation and stress, may lead to depression, which can further affect seizure control.\n\n**Recommendations and suggestions:**\n\n1. **Consult a neurologist or epileptologist:** Schedule an appointment with a specialist who has experience in managing epilepsy, particularly complex cases. They can reassess your mom's medication regimen and consider alternative treatments, such as:\n\t* Adding a new antiepileptic medication to the existing regimen.\n\t* Switching to a different medication or combination.\n\t* Adjusting the dosage or frequency of the current medications.\n2. **Allied health practitioners:** In addition to the psychologist, consider consulting:\n\t* An occupational therapist to assess and address any safety concerns, such as fall prevention and home modifications.\n\t* A social worker to help your mom connect with local support groups, address isolation, and provide emotional support.\n3. **Lifestyle modifications:**\n\t* Encourage your mom to maintain a seizure diary to track seizures, triggers, and potential patterns.\n\t* Help her develop stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\t* Support her in establishing a regular sleep schedule, exercise routine, and healthy diet.\n4. **Safety measures:**\n\t* Ensure your mom's home is seizure-proofed, with measures such as:\n\t\t+ Removing tripping hazards.\n\t\t+ Installing grab bars and non-slip mats in the bathroom.\n\t\t+ Using a helmet or protective gear when engaging in activities that may pose a risk of injury.\n5. **Explore alternative therapies:**\n\t* Consider consulting a healthcare professional about alternative therapies, such as:\n\t\t+ Acupuncture.\n\t\t+ Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\t\t+ Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with a neurologist or epileptologist to reassess your mom's medication regimen and discuss potential adjustments.\n2. Continue with the planned psychologist appointment to address the psychological aspects of her condition.\n3. Explore the recommended allied health practitioners and lifestyle modifications to support your mom's overall well-being and seizure management.\n\nRemember, every individual with epilepsy is unique, and it may take time to find the right combination of treatments and strategies to effectively manage your mom's condition. Be patient, and work collaboratively with her healthcare team to find the best approach."

        "question": "Ever since I was a little kid, every few months I get hit with absolutely insatiable vinegar cravings. I will straight up drink it from the bottle and still want more. I also get cravings like this for things that are quite acidic in nature, such as lemons, hot sauce, or tomatoes. As a kid my parents would have to literally cut me off because I would eat so much my lips would turn white, and I\u2019d still want more. I\u2019ll sit down and eat an entire head of lettuce, bundle of celery, full size cucumber, etc with vinegar on it. (Idk if this is important, but I hate apple cider vinegar. My go to is red wine vinegar, but white vinegar or balsamic will also do the trick.) I do imbibe on occasion and have noticed that the last two days after I did get these vinegar cravings, but other than that, I can\u2019t pinpoint any specific triggers.I\u2019m a healthy weight and eat a fairly varied diet, and the only oddities in my bloodwork are low white blood cell counts.I\u2019ve heard that sometimes intense cravings can signal some sort of biological clue for a nutrient that is missing. Could that be something that is going on? I was just curious! This doesn\u2019t really negatively impact my life, it just causes me to get some weird looks sometimes.Details: 23F, 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs, Caucasian, acid cravings, existing medical issues (Migraines, IST, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation), medications (verapamil and singulair), no drugs, sparingly drink, no smoking.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The mysterious world of cravings! I'm happy to help you explore possible explanations for your intense vinegar cravings.\n\nFirst, it's essential to acknowledge that cravings can be complex and influenced by various factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental components. While it's not possible to pinpoint a single cause without more information, I'll offer some potential insights and hypotheses.\n\n**Biological clues:**\n\n1. **Mineral deficiencies:** Your low white blood cell count and vinegar cravings might be related to mineral deficiencies, such as:\n\t* Magnesium: important for immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased acidity in the body.\n\t* Potassium: helps regulate fluid balance and acidity; a deficiency might contribute to cravings for acidic foods.\n\t* Zinc: essential for immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis; its deficiency can cause unusual cravings.\n2. **Digestive health:** Your love for acidic foods might be related to digestive issues, such as:\n\t* Low stomach acid: some people with low stomach acid production might crave acidic foods to help with protein digestion.\n\t* Gut microbiome imbalance: an imbalance of gut bacteria can lead to unusual cravings, including those for acidic or sour foods.\n3. **Hormonal influences:** Hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during menstruation or menopause, can affect taste preferences and cravings.\n\n**Other possible explanations:**\n\n1. **Neurotransmitter regulation:** Vinegar contains compounds like acetic acid, which can influence neurotransmitter regulation, such as serotonin and dopamine, which play roles in appetite and taste perception.\n2. **Taste preference:** Your brain might simply be wired to enjoy the taste of acidic foods, which is a common phenomenon.\n3. **Emotional or psychological factors:** Stress, boredom, or emotional states can trigger cravings for certain foods, including acidic ones.\n\n**Medication and medical condition interactions:**\n\n1. **Verapamil:** This medication can cause changes in taste perception, which might contribute to your cravings.\n2. **Migraines:** Some research suggests that people with migraines might have altered taste preferences or cravings, potentially related to serotonin regulation.\n3. **Mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation:** These heart conditions might lead to changes in blood flow, oxygenation, or nutrient delivery, which could, in theory, influence cravings.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult your doctor:** Discuss your cravings and medical history with your primary care physician or a registered dietitian to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your cravings.\n2. **Keep a food diary:** Tracking your food intake, cravings, and symptoms can help identify potential patterns or correlations.\n3. **Explore nutrient deficiencies:** Consider consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to discuss potential mineral deficiencies and ways to address them through diet or supplements.\n4. **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help regulate your body's acidity levels and reduce cravings.\n\nRemember, it's essential to maintain a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. While your vinegar cravings might be unusual, they don't seem to be harming your overall health. Enjoy your acidic foods in moderation, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have further questions or concerns!"

        "question": " I\u2019m 19F about 5\u20193\u201d not sure about my weight but quite small from the UK.So, in the past, I\u2019ve had what I believe to be 3 tonic-clonic seizures. I never actually got medical advice for these because 2 happened after smoking weed and one when my (untrained) friend pierced my nose and I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out about any of these with a trip to the doctors (when they did ever find out they just thought I fainted because it was a hot day etc) These were years ago so I haven\u2019t thought about them much. An hour or so ago my boyfriend was having a normal conversation with me and I started panicking for no reason at all and from past experience felt like I was going to have or had just had a seizure. I got really hot, dizzy, panicky, shaky and just didn\u2019t feel right overall. I felt kind of disconnected if that makes any sense. I thought this might be a focal seizure. A while afterwards though I still didn\u2019t feel normal, I\u2019ve been staring at my room for about 20 minutes just looking around and closed my eyes for 10 minutes with my knees to my chest rocking side to side. I just don\u2019t feel quite normal at the moment and I\u2019m not sure if I could have epilepsy or it could just be my mental health (I have depression, anxiety and occasionally worry I have schizophrenia) but I thought I was doing alright mentally at the moment.Sorry for the long post, as I say it\u2019s my first ever post on Reddit and I\u2019m just very confused about what\u2019s going on at the moment.Any ideas or advice would be great!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can offer some general information and suggestions. It's great that you're taking the first step by sharing your concerns.\n\nGiven your past experiences with what you believe to be tonic-clonic seizures and your recent episode, it's essential to consult a medical professional for a proper evaluation. While it's possible that your symptoms could be related to epilepsy, it's also important to consider other potential explanations, such as anxiety, panic attacks, or other underlying medical conditions.\n\nFocal seizures, which you mentioned, are a type of seizure that affects only one part of the brain, and they can cause a range of symptoms, including feeling disconnected, dizzy, or panicked. However, only a medical professional can determine whether you've experienced a seizure or something else entirely.\n\nYour mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, can also contribute to your symptoms, and it's possible that your recent episode was related to a panic attack or a exacerbation of your existing conditions. However, it's crucial to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nI strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with your general practitioner (GP) as soon as possible to discuss your concerns. Be honest with your GP about your past experiences, including the seizures and your mental health conditions. It's also essential to inform your GP about your recent episode and any other symptoms you're experiencing.\n\nIn the meantime, consider keeping a symptom journal to track any episodes, including the date, time, and any potential triggers. This can help your GP better understand your condition and make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nSome questions to ask your GP during your appointment:\n\n1. What could be causing my symptoms?\n2. Should I undergo any tests, such as an EEG or MRI, to rule out underlying conditions?\n3. How can I manage my symptoms, and what treatment options are available?\n4. Can my mental health conditions be contributing to my symptoms, and if so, how can I address this?\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Don't hesitate to reach out to your GP or a medical professional for guidance and support.\n\nAs a Reddit user, you may also want to consider posting in subreddits like r/epilepsy, r/mentalhealth, or r/AskDoctor, where you can connect with others who may have experienced similar symptoms and get advice from medical professionals. However, always prioritize consulting a medical professional for personalized advice and diagnosis."

The lump happened to appear after the injury. It wasn\u2019t super painful so I kept on skating after a few more incidents to the same area I decided to take a break. I\u2019m about a week removed from skating and haven\u2019t seen a noticeable improvement. No pain. Just sensitive to the touch. Thanks in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll provide some general insights. Please keep in mind that a proper diagnosis and advice can only be given by a qualified medical professional.\n\nGiven your symptoms and history, it's possible that the lump on your distal tibia could be related to the skateboard injury. Since you've had repetitive trauma to the area, it's not uncommon to experience swelling, bruising, or even a hematoma (a collection of blood outside the blood vessels).\n\nThe fact that the lump is on the medial side of the distal tibia, off the bone, and sensitive to touch, but not painful, suggests a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Hematoma or bruising**: As mentioned earlier, repetitive trauma to the area could have caused bleeding into the soft tissues, leading to a hematoma or bruising.\n2. **Bone contusion**: A bone contusion is a bruise of the bone, which can occur when the bone is injured, but not broken. This could be causing the lump and sensitivity.\n3. **Soft tissue injury**: You might have injured the surrounding soft tissues, such as ligaments, tendons, or muscles, which could be causing the lump and sensitivity.\n\nIt's good that you've taken a break from skating, as continued activity could exacerbate the injury. However, since you haven't seen any improvement after a week, it's essential to consult a medical professional for a proper evaluation.\n\nAs you have epilepsy and are taking Keppra, it's crucial to inform your doctor about your medical history, as some medications or conditions can affect the healing process or interact with potential treatments.\n\nConsider visiting an orthopedic specialist or a sports medicine physician, who can:\n\n1. Conduct a thorough physical examination to assess the lump, sensitivity, and range of motion.\n2. Order imaging studies (e.g., X-rays, MRI, or CT scans) to rule out any underlying fractures, bone lesions, or other conditions.\n3. Provide guidance on the best course of treatment, which may include rest, ice, compression, elevation, or physical therapy.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to injuries, especially if you're experiencing persistent symptoms or concerns."

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that your relative is going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling lost and concerned about her condition. I'll do my best to help you understand the situation and offer some suggestions.\n\nFirstly, it's great that she's been seeing neurologists and undergoing various tests. The fact that she was initially diagnosed with epilepsy and then possibly MS (Multiple Sclerosis) suggests that the doctors are trying to rule out different conditions.\n\nGiven the symptoms you've described, here are a few potential considerations:\n\n1. **Epilepsy**: Although she's been experiencing seizures, the fact that she's still fainting and having episodes of lost memory (\"autopilot\" moments) suggests that her epilepsy might not be fully controlled. It's possible that her medication regimen needs to be adjusted or that she has a different type of epilepsy that's not responding to the current treatment.\n2. **Catamenial epilepsy**: The fact that she tends to faint more frequently before her period (every 2 weeks) could be related to catamenial epilepsy, a type of epilepsy that's linked to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. This might be worth exploring further with her neurologist.\n3. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Although the corticosteroids were withdrawn, it's possible that MS is still a consideration. MS can cause a wide range of symptoms, including seizures, memory loss, and episodes of loss of consciousness. However, the fact that the corticosteroids were withdrawn suggests that the diagnosis is not definitive.\n4. **Other conditions**: There are other conditions that could be contributing to her symptoms, such as:\n\t* **Syncope** (fainting spells) due to various causes (e.g., cardiac issues, dehydration, or vasovagal syncope).\n\t* **Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)**: These are events that resemble seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\t* **Hormonal imbalances**: As mentioned earlier, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle could be contributing to her symptoms.\n\t* **Sleep disorders**: Sleep disorders like narcolepsy or sleep apnea can cause episodes of lost consciousness or memory lapses.\n\nTo better understand your relative's condition, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Can you provide more details about her seizures? For example:\n\t* What do the seizures look like? Are they generalized (involving the whole body) or focal (involving a specific area of the body)?\n\t* How long do the seizures typically last?\n\t* Are there any specific triggers that seem to cause the seizures?\n2. Has she experienced any other symptoms besides seizures and fainting, such as:\n\t* Headaches\n\t* Fatigue\n\t* Muscle weakness\n\t* Vision problems\n\t* Cognitive difficulties (e.g., memory, concentration, or processing speed issues)\n3. Has she undergone any other tests besides MR scans, such as:\n\t* EEG (electroencephalogram) to monitor brain activity\n\t* Blood tests to check for hormonal imbalances or other possible causes\n\t* Sleep studies to assess for sleep disorders\n4. How has her treatment plan changed over time? Have the medications or dosages been adjusted, and if so, how has she responded to these changes?\n5. Are there any other medical conditions or allergies that she has, or any medications she's taking that could be contributing to her symptoms?\n\nPlease feel free to share any additional information you think might be relevant.

I don't have any signs of seizures when I wake up. It's always been hard to wake up in the mornings, but lately it's been awful. It feels like I didn't sleep at all.I was working today. I closed my eyes to blink, and everything was kinda dizzy, but it went away quick. It's hard to describe, it's kinda like dizziness, but also like everything's... dropping? Melting?It feels like my brain is tripping up just like with a myoclonic jerks, but there's no myclonic jerk. Weird right?I've just been trying to shake it off. I been on keppra for 3 or 4 years. Can it wear off?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's great to hear that your epilepsy has been well-controlled with Keppra. However, the new symptoms you're describing are concerning and warrant discussion with your healthcare provider. While it's possible that your symptoms could be related to various factors, including the Keppra itself, it's also important to consider other potential causes. Let's break down your symptoms and concerns:\n\n1. **Tiredness and difficulty waking up**: This could be due to a variety of factors including medication side effects, sleep quality issues, or other health conditions. Keppra can cause fatigue as a side effect, but it's also possible that your sleep, despite seeming adequate in terms of duration, might not be restorative. This could be due to sleep disorders, medication effects, or other underlying health issues.\n\n2. **Dizziness and \"dropping/melting\" sensation**: These are unusual symptoms and could be indicative of several things. Dizziness can be related to inner ear problems, blood pressure issues, or even side effects from medications. The \"dropping/melting\" sensation is particularly unusual and might be related to seizures or seizure-like activity that doesn't fully manifest as a traditional seizure. It's also possible that this could be a side effect of the medication or an indication of another neurological issue.\n\n3. **Feeling like your brain is \"tripping up\" without myoclonic jerks**: This description suggests that you might be experiencing some form of seizure or seizure-like activity that isn't fully developed. Myoclonic jerks are a type of seizure, and if you're experiencing sensations reminiscent of these without the physical jerking, it could indicate a need to reassess your medication regimen or the presence of another condition.\n\nAs for Keppra wearing off, it is possible for the effectiveness of any antiepileptic drug (AED) to decrease over time. This can happen due to various reasons, including changes in the way your body metabolizes the drug, development of resistance, or progression of the underlying epilepsy. However, the symptoms you're describing don't necessarily indicate that Keppra is no longer effective in controlling your seizures; rather, they suggest new or different symptoms that need to be evaluated.\n\n**What to Do**:\n- **Consult your healthcare provider**: It's crucial to discuss these new symptoms with your neurologist or healthcare provider. They can evaluate whether these symptoms are related to your epilepsy, the medication, or another condition.\n- **Detailed Description**: When you speak with your healthcare provider, try to give as detailed a description as possible of your symptoms, including when they started, how often they occur, and any factors that seem to trigger or alleviate them.\n- **Medication Review**: Your provider may consider adjusting your medication regimen, either by changing the dosage of Keppra or adding another medication to help manage your symptoms.\n- **Additional Testing**: Depending on your symptoms and medical history, your provider might recommend additional tests, such as EEG (electroencephalogram) to check for seizure activity, blood tests to check medication levels and rule out other conditions, or other diagnostic tests.\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of caution with new or worsening symptoms, especially when they could potentially be related to your neurological health."

I have never had a seizure before, and from what I understand, I shouldn\u2019t have one again because it was due to the high blood pressure caused by the eclampsia.The neurologist at the hospital put me on Keppra for a month just to be safe and prevent more seizures while my body recovered from the eclampsia. 1000mg twice a day.Well, I am off all blood pressure medications and have stabilized from the eclampsia, and now it\u2019s getting to be time to come off the Keppra and I am worried about what it will be like coming off.I\u2019ve read things about Keppra causing a lot of side effects when you come off it, which is very scary to me seeing as a lot of the day I am alone with my newborn and I cannot be in an unfit state during that time.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at risk for going off the Keppra triggering a seizure, right? Because it was a one time thing caused by high blood pressure? And my blood pressure is now under control? That\u2019s what scares me the most.

Should I ween off the meds or have I been in them a short enough time and the fact that I\u2019m not epileptic makes it safe to come off them without risking serious side effects?I am talking with the neurologist I saw at the hospital who prescribed me the Keppra, but he\u2019s been very nonchalant, not really getting back to me, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand my really big concerns because I am alone with a newborn for a lot of the day and I need to be 100% certain that coming off Keppra will not interfere with my ability to care for him.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I completely understand your concerns, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to discuss your situation with the neurologist. Given your unique circumstances, I'll provide some general information to help you better understand the process of coming off Keppra and address your concerns.\n\n**Weaning off Keppra:**\nThe American Academy of Neurology recommends tapering off antiepileptic medications like Keppra gradually to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms and seizures. The weaning process can take several weeks to a few months. A common tapering schedule is to reduce the dose by 25-50% every 1-2 weeks.\n\n**Your situation:**\nSince you've been on Keppra for a relatively short period (less than a month) and were prescribed it as a precautionary measure due to postpartum eclampsia, the risk of withdrawal symptoms or seizures might be lower compared to someone who has been on the medication long-term for epilepsy.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n1. **Postpartum eclampsia:** Although your blood pressure is now under control, it's crucial to ensure that your condition is stable and that you're not at risk for another seizure.\n2. **Newborn care:** As you've mentioned, being alone with your newborn for an extended period is a significant concern. You need to ensure that you're not putting yourself or your baby at risk.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Schedule a follow-up appointment:** Request a face-to-face appointment with the neurologist to discuss your concerns and create a plan for tapering off Keppra. If the neurologist is not responding promptly, consider seeking a second opinion or consulting with your primary care physician.\n2. **Gradual tapering:** Given your short treatment duration, a gradual tapering schedule might be more suitable for you. This will help minimize potential withdrawal symptoms and seizures.\n3. **Monitor your blood pressure:** Continue to monitor your blood pressure regularly to ensure it remains under control.\n4. **Newborn care support:** Consider arranging for additional support or childcare assistance during the tapering period, if possible, to ensure your baby's safety.\n5. **Keep a seizure diary:** Although you're not expected to have another seizure, keeping a seizure diary can help you track any potential symptoms or unusual events.\n\n**Questions to discuss with your neurologist:**\n\n1. What is the recommended tapering schedule for my situation?\n2. What are the potential risks and benefits of coming off Keppra?\n3. How will I be monitored during the tapering period?\n4. What signs or symptoms should I be aware of that might indicate a problem?\n5. Are there any additional precautions I should take to ensure my baby's safety during this period?\n\nRemember, it's essential to have an open and honest discussion with your neurologist about your concerns. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or additional guidance if you're not satisfied with the response. Your health and well-being, as well as your baby's safety, are paramount."

        "question": "Prefacing with comorbidities: obese, diabetic, hypertension 75 inches, 300lbs Early March, I had an episode where I felt what was almost like an electric shock in my right hand, followed by a similar sensation on the left side of my head. I fell unconscious, and the next thing I know, the EMTs are at my house. My wife states that I was convulsing, and, at one point, not breathing during the attack. After standard workups, they found a 8mm lesion on my brain. televisit Neurologist told me that it didn't look like cancer and that 'no neurosurgeon is going to operate on this.' Either way, I was scared. Went to a well-reputed hospital, and saw a neuro-oncologist. He felt this was serious, and ordered a functional MRI as well as a Stealth MRI. I was really happy to receive the results that this was not brain cancer, and was in fact vascular in nature (literally, anything but brain cancer, right?). I was referred to a neurosurgeon who deals with things more vascular in nature. He's ordered a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which I'm getting tomorrow. CTA showed a narrowing of my carotid artery, and he suspects it was a dissection. Either way, I'm simultaneously being treated by a neurologist at the same hospital as the aforementioned neurosurgeons in case this was a seizure (my initial diagnosis). I did not tolerate keppra well (rage), and am now on Vimpat. Almost every night, I have these episodes where I have this 'pit of my stomach' that I recognize as how I felt right before I had my initial attack. Questions: Are these seizures, or could this issue completely vascular in nature? Can a dissection/TIA cause seizures? What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner. Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)? Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide a comprehensive and empathetic response to your questions and concerns.\n\n**Summary of your situation:**\n\nYou had a sudden, unexplained episode in March with electric shock-like sensations, loss of consciousness, convulsions, and a brief period of apnea (not breathing). Initial workups revealed an 8mm brain lesion, which was later diagnosed as vascular in nature, not cancerous. You've undergone various tests, including functional MRI, Stealth MRI, CTA, and soon a diagnostic cerebral angiogram. You're being treated by a neurosurgeon for a suspected carotid artery dissection and a neurologist for potential seizure activity.\n\n**Addressing your questions:**\n\n1. **Are these episodes seizures, or could this issue be completely vascular in nature?**\n\nIt's possible that your episodes could be related to both seizure activity and vascular issues. The \"pit of your stomach\" sensation you experience before these episodes may be a prodrome (a warning sign) or an aura, which can occur before a seizure. However, the fact that you have a vascular lesion and suspected carotid artery dissection suggests that these episodes could also be related to transient cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain) or other vascular phenomena.\n2. **Can a dissection/TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) cause seizures?**\n\nYes, a dissection or TIA can cause seizures in some cases. A TIA, also known as a \"mini-stroke,\" can lead to transient cerebral ischemia, which may trigger seizure activity. Additionally, the resulting inflammation and damage to the brain tissue can increase the risk of seizures.\n3. **What about the initial attack? Looking up TIA online, I'm not seeing it presenting in this manner.**\n\nTIAs typically present with sudden, transient symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or tingling in a limb, vision changes, or speech difficulties. However, it's not uncommon for TIAs to present with atypical symptoms, including seizures, convulsions, or loss of consciousness. The fact that you experienced a prolonged episode with convulsions and apnea suggests that the underlying cause may be more complex, and the diagnosis of a TIA or dissection should be considered in the context of your overall clinical presentation.\n4. **Will I be on these seizure meds forever (They make me feel awful, with brain fog, etc.)?**\n\nIt's difficult to predict with certainty whether you'll need to be on seizure medications long-term. If your episodes are indeed seizures, and the underlying cause is related to the vascular lesion or dissection, your neurologist may adjust your medication regimen to minimize side effects and optimize seizure control. If the diagnostic cerebral angiogram reveals a treatable vascular condition, such as a dissection, addressing the underlying cause may help reduce or eliminate the need for seizure medications.\n5. **Did I develop Epilepsy at age 35?**\n\nIt's possible that you may have developed epilepsy, but it's also possible that your seizures are secondary to the underlying vascular condition. Epilepsy is typically diagnosed after a person has had two or more unprovoked seizures. Your neurologist will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Diagnostic cerebral angiogram:** This test will help determine the extent of the carotid artery dissection and guide further treatment.\n2. **Ongoing monitoring:** Your neurologist and neurosurgeon will continue to monitor your condition, adjusting your treatment plan as needed.\n3. **Medication adjustments:** Your neurologist may adjust your seizure medication regimen to minimize side effects and optimize seizure control.\n4. **Lifestyle modifications:** Your healthcare team may recommend lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of further vascular events, such as managing your blood pressure, diabetes, and weight.\n\nIt's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your condition and address any concerns or side effects you're experiencing. Keep a symptom journal to track your episodes, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare providers if you have any questions or concerns."

        "question": "Why does my head feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking when I put my hands on my forehead and press them down into my pillow ? I am 21M, I am 21 and a male, 5\u20199 roughly in height, I weight roughly 60 KG, I take epilepsy medication called Epilim 6 tablets per day in the morning and the evening, I\u2019m a non smoker, I am white/ Caucasian, I don\u2019t use drugs, my issue is twitching problems, this issue started on the 27th of September and has lasted till this day, it has happened in Leeds the United Kingdom. I have only had absence seizures before which nobody ever noticed, the neurologist that I saw in Poland this summer said it\u2019s very likely that I will only have absence seizures my whole life. 5 days ago I noticed that my leg started slightly twitching, I noticed this physically and I don\u2019t feel it unless I see it, 2-3 days ago I felt my left arm slightly twitching. When I put my head into my pillow in a certain position or against my bed I feel like it\u2019s slightly shaking, other wise I get no other feeling from my head. 5 days ago I started getting small weird twitches in my left upper arm and right leg nowhere else in my body, the doctors that I saw today and yesterday said that Yesterday when I was sleeping I felt that a weird shaking feeling in my body at night but honestly unlike the other feelings this might have not even happened, I\u2019m not sure that it did happen. I saw two doctors about this yesterday and both said it\u2019s probably from stress and the doctor yesterday said it\u2019s the fasciculation of muscle from stress. They booked me in with a neurologist but it might take 3 week. What\u2019s wrong with me ?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to help you understand what might be happening, but please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and only a qualified medical professional can provide a definitive diagnosis and advice.\n\nGiven your medical history of epilepsy, specifically absence seizures, and your current symptoms, there are several possibilities to consider. The fact that you're experiencing twitching and a sensation of shaking, particularly when you apply pressure to your head or when you're in certain positions, suggests that there could be a few factors at play:\n\n1. **Fasciculations**: As one of the doctors mentioned, fasciculations are small, local, involuntary muscle contractions (twitches) that are often visible under the skin. These can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, anxiety, fatigue, or even mild dehydration. They can also be a side effect of certain medications, though it's less common.\n\n2. **Muscle contractions or twitches**: The twitching you feel in your leg and arm could be related to muscle fatigue, stress, or even a side effect of your medication (Epilim). Sometimes, medications can cause side effects that include muscle weakness or twitching.\n\n3. **Positional effects**: The feeling that your head is shaking when you put it in a certain position against your pillow could be related to the way your body is positioned, possibly affecting the blood flow or the way your muscles are aligned, leading to these sensations.\n\n4. **Anxiety or stress**: Both doctors you saw suggested stress as a possible cause, which can indeed manifest physically in various ways, including muscle tension and twitches.\n\n5. **Side effects of medication**: While Epilim (valproate) is effective for managing epilepsy, it can have side effects, though muscle twitching is not the most commonly reported side effect. However, it's always a possibility, especially if there have been changes in your dosage or if you're particularly sensitive to the medication.\n\n6. **Other neurological conditions**: Although your neurologist in Poland suggested that you would likely only experience absence seizures, it's possible that your condition could be evolving or that there's another underlying condition contributing to your symptoms. The twitching and shaking sensations could be indicative of other issues, but without a thorough examination and possibly some tests, it's difficult to determine this.\n\nGiven that you've been booked to see a neurologist, it's a good idea to wait for their professional assessment. In the meantime, consider the following:\n\n- **Keep a symptom diary**: Track when the twitching and shaking sensations occur, what you're doing when they happen, and any potential triggers you notice.\n- **Stay hydrated**: Sometimes, dehydration can exacerbate muscle twitching.\n- **Manage stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n- **Follow your medication regimen**: Continue taking your epilepsy medication as prescribed unless advised otherwise by a healthcare professional.\n\nWhen you see the neurologist, be sure to share all your symptoms in detail, including the ones you're not entirely sure about, like the possible shaking feeling at night. They can evaluate your overall condition, possibly run some tests, and provide a more accurate diagnosis and guidance."

        "question": "About a month ago i smoked a little weed with my friends at a pool and when i got out i started feeling extremely light headed so i went to go sit down on a lounge chair next thing i knew i was on the ground everything was completely black and i couldn't see or hear anything all i could feel was my body flopping around uncontrollably and i couldn't stop it. The whole experience only lasted about 15 seconds but it felt like 15 minutes then out of nowhere i was able to stand up and my vision cleared and i was fine if anyone has any experience with or knows why this happened please help me im scared there could be underlying health issues i never knew about (i smoke fairly frequently and it never happened prior to this incident or after any help would be greatly appreciated)Edit: mods removed my first post for not adding this so age and gender 16m weight 132lbs height 6'3 no medical issues aside from psychological and im on no medications",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll provide some general information that might be helpful. It's great that you're taking this experience seriously and seeking answers.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms you described, such as feeling lightheaded, losing consciousness, and experiencing uncontrollable body movements, could be related to several factors. Since you mentioned that you had smoked weed before and this was an isolated incident, it's possible that the combination of the drug, heat, and physical activity might have contributed to the episode.\r\n\r\nSome potential explanations could be:\r\n\r\n1. **Dehydration and heat stroke**: Spending time in the sun, especially in a hot environment like a pool, can lead to dehydration. Weed can also increase heart rate and blood pressure, which might exacerbate dehydration. This could have caused you to feel lightheaded and lose consciousness.\r\n2. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common condition where the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as stress, heat, or dehydration, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. This can cause a person to faint or experience a brief loss of consciousness.\r\n3. **Orthostatic hypotension**: This is a condition where blood pressure drops suddenly when standing up, which can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and even fainting.\r\n4. **Seizure-like activity**: Although less likely, it's possible that the combination of weed and other factors might have triggered a seizure-like activity, which could have caused the uncontrollable body movements.\r\n\r\nGiven your age, height, and weight, it's essential to consider the possibility of underlying health issues. I strongly recommend consulting a doctor, preferably a neurologist or a primary care physician, to discuss this incident in more detail. They can:\r\n\r\n* Evaluate your overall health and medical history\r\n* Perform a physical examination\r\n* Discuss your psychological health and any potential connections to the incident\r\n* Consider ordering tests (e.g., EEG, ECG, blood work) to rule out any underlying conditions\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, consider the following:\r\n\r\n* Stay hydrated, especially when spending time in the sun or engaging in physical activity\r\n* Avoid smoking weed, at least until you've consulted a doctor and discussed the potential risks and interactions with any underlying conditions\r\n* Be mindful of your body's response to physical activity and heat\r\n\r\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Consulting a doctor will help you determine the cause of this incident and ensure that you're not at risk for any underlying conditions.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and my response is not a substitute for proper medical advice. Seek professional help to get a accurate diagnosis and guidance."

        "question": "Today the mathematics docent in my university, who is approximately 60 years old, froze for some 20 sec leaning on his desk, then his face's right half made something like a smile, and he turned his head slightly rightwards, for some 15 sec, and as we were just realizing something's wrong, he burst out in short unnatural laughter, moving his hands away from the desk, then stiffened and fell back. He hit his head at the board; of course, we called ambulance. I was out to wait for it, but after accounts of my colleagues who stayed with the docent, he was unconscious for 5-7 minutes, foam from his mouth, and as I could myself see, blood had run from within his left ear (the medics who came commented than it could be that he got a skull fracture from the hit in the board rim which is metallic; his skin on the front left of his head where he apparently hit the board was reddish, scratched from the rub; although it appeared to me that he must rather hit the board with the rare of his head). He was desoriented, not sure how much he understood, but he answered negatively when they asked him if he had epilepsy. I read this whole afternoon about strokes and epilepsy but none of the various descriptions seems to match what I witnessed (esp. the disturbing laughter). Some idea?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're concerned about your mathematics docent's well-being. The symptoms you described are indeed unusual and don't fit perfectly into the typical presentations of stroke or epilepsy. However, I'll try to provide some insights based on the information you provided.\n\nThe sequence of events you witnessed could be suggestive of a complex medical condition. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Freezing and leaning on the desk**: This could indicate a loss of motor control or a sudden decrease in level of consciousness.\n2. **Asymmetric facial smile and head turn**: This might indicate a focal neurological sign, potentially related to brain activity or a seizure.\n3. **Unnatural laughter**: This is an unusual symptom, but it's possible that it was a result of abnormal brain activity, such as a seizure or a transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n4. **Loss of consciousness, foam from the mouth, and stiffening**: These symptoms suggest a generalized seizure or a severe medical event.\n5. **Blood from the left ear and possible skull fracture**: The fall and subsequent head injury likely contributed to the bleeding and potential fracture.\n\nConsidering these symptoms, some potential possibilities could include:\n\n* **Seizure with a focal onset**: The asymmetric facial smile and head turn might indicate a focal seizure, which could have spread to become a generalized seizure.\n* **Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke**: Although you mentioned that the symptoms don't match typical stroke presentations, a TIA or stroke could still be a possibility, especially if the docent has underlying vascular risk factors.\n* **Frontal lobe seizure or tumor**: The unusual laughter and loss of consciousness could be related to a frontal lobe seizure or a tumor affecting the brain's limbic system.\n* **Other conditions**: Such as a brain hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, or other vascular abnormalities.\n\nIt's essential to note that the docent's age and potential underlying medical conditions could contribute to the complexity of the diagnosis.\n\nThe fact that the medics suspected a skull fracture from the hit on the metallic board rim is concerning, and the docent should undergo thorough medical evaluation, including imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI) to assess for any structural abnormalities or injuries.\n\nI would recommend that the docent undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation, including:\n\n* Immediate neurological assessment and monitoring\n* Imaging studies (CT or MRI) to evaluate for structural abnormalities or injuries\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess for seizure activity\n* Laboratory tests to rule out underlying conditions, such as infections or metabolic disorders\n\nIt's also essential for the docent to have a thorough follow-up with a neurologist to determine the underlying cause of the episode and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I wish your mathematics docent a speedy recovery."

        "question": "So I am a 26 y/o male and I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago.  went to my current neurologist and he prescribed me Lamotrigine tablets for the seizures. He only prescribed them in 6 month increments and will not renew the prescription until I come in for another appointment. Currently I am on my last month of the prescription and had not scheduled an appointment yet. I tried to renew the prescription through my pharmacy, but the Dr declined the renewal request. I was able to make a last minute appointment for tomorrow but that seems a little wrong of him to do that. What if I was unable to schedule an appointment before my prescription ran out? I know it\u2019s on me to reschedule the appointments but this is potentially life saving medication for me. These are not opiates or amphetamines. I just didn\u2019t know if this was the norm or if the Dr is being unnecessarily difficult. Thank you for any clarification on this.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I completely understand your concern and frustration. It's reasonable to expect that your neurologist would prioritize ensuring you have a continuous supply of a medication that's essential for managing your epilepsy.\n\nThe practice of only prescribing medication in limited increments (e.g., 6 months) and requiring regular appointments for renewal is not uncommon, especially for medications that require ongoing monitoring or have potential side effects. However, in the case of medications like Lamotrigine, which are considered essential for managing a chronic condition like epilepsy, it's generally considered best practice to ensure a stable and uninterrupted supply.\n\nThe situation you described, where your neurologist declined a renewal request through the pharmacy and required an in-person appointment, may be an overly restrictive approach. This could potentially put you at risk of a seizure if you were unable to schedule an appointment before your prescription ran out.\n\nWhile it's true that it's your responsibility to schedule follow-up appointments, it's also your neurologist's responsibility to ensure that you have access to the medication you need to manage your condition. A more patient-centered approach might involve:\n\n1. Allowing pharmacy renewals or electronic renewals, especially for medications like Lamotrigine that are not typically associated with abuse or diversion.\n2. Providing a longer prescription duration (e.g., 12 months) to reduce the frequency of appointments and minimize the risk of interruptions in medication supply.\n3. Offering alternative scheduling options, such as virtual appointments or phone consultations, to make it easier for you to maintain a consistent supply of medication.\n\nIt's possible that your neurologist has specific reasons for their approach, such as concerns about medication adherence, side effects, or the need for regular monitoring. However, it's essential to communicate your concerns and needs to your neurologist.\n\nConsider discussing the following with your neurologist during your upcoming appointment:\n\n1. Your concerns about the potential risks of interrupted medication supply.\n2. Your need for a stable and uninterrupted supply of Lamotrigine.\n3. Alternative scheduling options or pharmacy renewal policies that could better meet your needs.\n\nYou may also want to ask about the possibility of:\n\n1. A backup prescription or emergency supply of medication in case you're unable to schedule an appointment before your prescription runs out.\n2. A more flexible prescription duration or renewal policy.\n\nRemember, as a patient, you have the right to advocate for yourself and your healthcare needs. Don't hesitate to express your concerns and work with your neurologist to find a solution that prioritizes your health and well-being."

        "question": "I was recently diagnosed by a neurologist with partial epilepsy. the symptoms I had were burning sensation in the back of my head and neck and my back, memory and concentration problems and tightness inside of my head, I felt it in the beginning in the top of my head back in 2017, and starting from 2018 it transferred to the bottom inside of my head. I got prescribed Zeptol 200mg (Carbamazepine) and one for memory and concentration and another for something else (I'll update this with the other prescriptions, I'm writing this from work because I'm on the verge of quitting). I previously thought that I had a problem with my neck or something that has to do with my spine. I have gone to several neurologists and this is the only one that mentioned partial epilepsy. The previous ones all said it was nothing to worry about. I, today have dementia. I have trouble following courses or job meetings or anything. Sometimes I forget the name of people around me. I should mention as well that I feel something really tight in the bottom back of my head. After some research I found that a part of the brain called hippocampus is the one responsible for short term memory processing. It's been a week and a half using Zeptol (200mg). I started with one a day for a week. Now the second week I increased it to two, just as my neurologist said. I still don't feel the benefit that I wanted, to gain back my short term memory. Is the damage done to my short term memory reversible, or am I gonna be like this for the rest of my life?eventually having Alzheimer in my 30s?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging time. I'll do my best to provide you with a comprehensive and empathetic response.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on finally getting a diagnosis from a neurologist who took your symptoms seriously. Partial epilepsy can manifest in various ways, and it's great that you're receiving treatment.\n\nRegarding your concerns about short-term memory and potential long-term effects, I'll break down some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Reversibility of short-term memory damage**: The impact of partial epilepsy on short-term memory can be reversible to some extent, but it depends on several factors, such as the severity and frequency of seizures, the effectiveness of treatment, and individual brain resilience. Research suggests that successful treatment of epilepsy can lead to significant improvements in cognitive function, including short-term memory.\n2. **Hippocampus and short-term memory**: You're correct that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in short-term memory processing. However, it's essential to note that the hippocampus is a complex structure, and its function can be affected by various factors, including epilepsy, stress, and other neurological conditions.\n3. **Zeptol (Carbamazepine) and treatment**: You've just started taking Zeptol, and it's essential to give it time to take effect. It's not uncommon for it to take several weeks or even months to notice significant improvements. Your neurologist's guidance on dosage and treatment is crucial, so be sure to follow their recommendations and attend follow-up appointments.\n4. **Additional medications**: You mentioned other prescriptions for memory and concentration. These might be intended to address specific cognitive symptoms or comorbid conditions. It's essential to discuss these medications with your neurologist and understand their role in your treatment plan.\n5. **Dementia and Alzheimer's disease**: While it's understandable to worry about the potential for dementia or Alzheimer's disease, it's essential to note that these conditions are relatively rare in people under 30. Your neurologist's diagnosis of partial epilepsy is a separate condition, and effective management of epilepsy can help mitigate cognitive decline.\n6. **Cognitive rehabilitation and lifestyle modifications**: In addition to medication, consider incorporating cognitive rehabilitation strategies, such as:\n\t* Cognitive training and memory exercises\n\t* Stress management techniques (e.g., meditation, yoga)\n\t* Regular exercise and physical activity\n\t* Healthy sleep habits\n\t* Social engagement and cognitive stimulation\n7. **Follow-up appointments and open communication**: Regularly schedule follow-up appointments with your neurologist to discuss your progress, adjust your treatment plan as needed, and address any concerns or questions you may have.\n\nTo better understand your situation and provide more tailored guidance, I have a few questions:\n\n* Can you please update me on the other prescriptions you're taking, as you mentioned?\n* Have you experienced any significant seizures or episodes since starting Zeptol?\n* How have you been coping with your symptoms, and what strategies have you found helpful so far?\n* Are there any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss with your neurologist during your next appointment?\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your neurologist and other healthcare professionals to manage your condition and address your concerns. Don't hesitate to reach out to them with questions or worries."

They did a bunch of tests, and realized I was having from 6-10 \"silent\" seizures a day. I probably had them when I was younger too and they just went away, and came back due to my lack of sleep in the past couple of weeks and anxiety. I honestly didn't even know that was a thing until yesterday, so thank you all. They also did a GI and said that I might have gastroparesis, which would explain pretty much all my symptoms when it comes to weight-loss, and I have an appointment for a gastric emptying study in 2 weeks from now. Thank you all!EDIT: I've called them brain zaps my whole life, but I didn't know that was an actual medical term for something completely different. Its not the withdrawal kinda zaps, it's like a loss of consciousness that I get, but still stay standing up.EDIT 2: No, I don't have an eating disorder.

        "answer": "It sounds like you've been experiencing some pretty strange and unsettling symptoms, and I'm glad you're getting some medical attention to try to figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst of all, I want to acknowledge that it's completely reasonable to feel a bit \"insane\" when you're experiencing weird and unexplained physical sensations. It can be really scary and isolating.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like you've been having some kind of episodes where you lose consciousness or feel a sense of \"zapping\" or disconnection from your body. You've also been experiencing significant weight loss, lack of appetite, and difficulty keeping food down.\n\nThe fact that doctors have ruled out an eating disorder and are now exploring other possibilities, such as gastroparesis, is a good sign that they're taking your symptoms seriously and trying to get to the bottom of things.\n\nThe discovery of the \"silent\" seizures is also a significant finding, and it's possible that these could be contributing to some of your other symptoms. It's interesting that you mention you've been experiencing anxiety and lack of sleep, as these can both be triggers for seizures.\n\nI'm glad you have an appointment scheduled for a gastric emptying study, which should help provide more information about your digestive system and whether gastroparesis is a possibility.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. It's okay to feel overwhelmed or scared, but try to focus on the fact that you're taking steps to get help and figure out what's going on.\n\nHow are you feeling right now, and is there anything specific that's been on your mind or causing you distress?"

        "answer": "I can sense your concern and frustration. It's understandable to have fears about your health, especially when you're experiencing unusual sensations and symptoms. I'll try to help you break down your concerns and offer some insights.\n\n**Deja vu**: This is a relatively common phenomenon, especially in young adults. It's usually not a cause for concern and can be related to stress, fatigue, or even certain medications.\n\n**Fear of brain tumor/epilepsy**: It's natural to worry about these conditions, but it's essential to remember that they are relatively rare. Your neurologist's evaluation a year ago, which included reflex and eyesight tests, did not indicate any neurological deficits.\n\n**Dream flashbacks**: These can be disturbing, but they're not typically a sign of a underlying neurological condition.\n\n**Weird head/body vibrations/buzzing**: This could be related to anxiety, stress, or even certain sleep disorders. It's possible that you're experiencing a type of hypnagogic jerk or a benign sensation that occurs when you're falling asleep.\n\n**Racing heart and depersonalization**: These symptoms can be linked to anxiety, stress, or even sleep deprivation. Depersonalization is a common experience, especially in individuals with anxiety or OCD.\n\n**EEG**: While an EEG can be a useful diagnostic tool, it's not always necessary. Your neurologist may have considered your symptoms and medical history before deciding not to order an EEG at that time.\n\n**Hypochondria**: It's great that you're aware of your tendency to worry excessively about your health. This can be a challenge, but it's essential to find a balance between being proactive about your health and not overdoing it.\n\nConsidering your symptoms and concerns, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track when your symptoms occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers. This can help you identify patterns and provide valuable information for your healthcare provider.\n2. **Discuss your concerns with your neurologist again**: It may be helpful to have a follow-up conversation with your neurologist to discuss your ongoing concerns and symptoms. They can reassess your situation and provide guidance on whether an EEG or other tests are necessary.\n3. **Anxiety management**: Given your history of anxiety and OCD, it's essential to continue working on managing these conditions. This may include therapy, relaxation techniques, or other stress-reducing strategies.\n4. **Sleep habits**: Establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and create a relaxing sleep environment to help improve your sleep quality.\n5. **Education and reassurance**: Learn more about your symptoms and the conditions you're concerned about. Sometimes, education and reassurance from a healthcare professional can help alleviate worries and reduce hypochondriac tendencies.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with your healthcare provider if you're concerned about your symptoms. However, it's also essential to find a balance between being proactive and not overdoing it.\n\nHow do you feel about discussing your concerns with your neurologist again or exploring anxiety management techniques?"

        "question": "23 AFAB in Canada, 500mg keppra 2x daily, 50mg lamotrigine daily, recently given Tylenol 3\u2019s, Zofran, and torodol to take. Hi all! I\u2019m 23, have endo, PCOS, gastroparesis, and epilepsy. I had my first excision laparoscopy at 17, was on birth control until it gave me a stroke, did the whole Lupron then Orillissa thing for two years until it stopped working, had an IUD until it got embedded into my uterus, and now I\u2019m lucky to be the patient of an excision specialist willing to do a hysterectomy and excision surgery within the next 6-9 months. I\u2019ve done pelvic physiotherapy too, and eat gluten free since it significantly reduces my pain (might be celiac, haven\u2019t been tested). I\u2019m currently having pain way worse than usual and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s my left ovary (sharp left lower quadrant pain but it radiates to the back, across my abdomen, with some rebound pain but not significant). I went to the ER and they could see some of the ovary, could see that both ovaries had \u201cmultiple follicles\u201d (I presume this is my PCOS, unsure how many they mean by multiple) but couldn\u2019t tell if it was torsion or not, gave me IV morphine in a 1L bolus, sent me home with the T3\u2019s and zofran with instructions to come back if it didn\u2019t get better for another U/S and a CT. (Urinalysis and US ruled out urinary concerns, idea behind the CT was to rule out diverticulitis I believe). No pregnancy or STI risk. Ijust went back and saw a doctor who ridiculed me, suggested birth control, wouldn\u2019t let me speak, and said \u201cI guess we can give you morphine, this is the problem with you pain patients\u201d. He also suggested prescribing more narcotics which I repeatedly said I want to rule out torsion instead of being given even more narcotics. He said torsion would make me vomit, but I\u2019m on zofran. My family doctor is off until September, my pelvic physiotherapist is booked until September, I\u2019ll try calling my surgeon tomorrow. But what the hell do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m in excruciating pain and I don\u2019t want to be chewing on codeine. I\u2019m just so frustrated. I\u2019m an active 23 year old grad student, I\u2019m so close to getting rid of these useless organs, but I\u2019m sitting here passing out from pain. My main concern is that my seizure risk increases as I\u2019m in more pain, my second concern is developing a drug dependency. Any advice is welcome.",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this incredibly challenging and frustrating experience. It's unacceptable that you were treated with disrespect and dismissal by the doctor you saw. Given your complex medical history and current situation, here are some steps and considerations that might help you navigate this:\n\n1. **Seek a Second Opinion Urgently**: Try to get an appointment with another doctor as soon as possible. Given that your family doctor and pelvic physiotherapist are unavailable, consider visiting another ER or urgent care facility if your pain worsens or if you experience any signs of ovarian torsion or other serious conditions, such as severe vomiting, fever, or if your pain significantly increases.\n\n2. **Contact Your Surgeon**: Reaching out to your surgeon, as you've planned, is a good step. Even if they cannot see you immediately, their office might be able to provide guidance or expedite your surgery if your condition worsens.\n\n3. **Advocate for Yourself**: When you see another healthcare provider, be clear and direct about your condition, your concerns about potential ovarian torsion, and your desire to avoid further narcotic medications. Bring a list of your medications, medical history, and the treatments you've undergone. It might be helpful to have a friend or family member with you for support and to help advocate on your behalf.\n\n4. **Consider a Pain Management Clinic**: Many hospitals have pain management clinics that can offer a range of treatments beyond narcotics, including nerve blocks, physical therapy, and other interventions that might help manage your pain while you wait for your surgery.\n\n5. **Follow Up on Testing**: Insist on further diagnostic testing if you haven't already had it, to rule out other causes of your pain, such as a CT scan as mentioned, but also consider asking for an MRI if possible, as it can sometimes provide more detailed images of soft tissues.\n\n6. **Be Cautious with Medications**: While it's understandable that you're being prescribed pain medications, be vigilant about their use, especially considering your concerns about dependency. Also, be aware of drug interactions, especially since you're on Keppra and Lamotrigine for epilepsy.\n\n7. **Document Everything**: Keep a detailed journal of your pain, including when it occurs, how long it lasts, any triggers you notice, and any relief you get from medications or other interventions. This can be incredibly helpful for healthcare providers trying to understand your condition.\n\n8. **Support Network**: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help with managing your daily life and for emotional support. Dealing with chronic pain and navigating healthcare systems can be incredibly isolating.\n\n9. **Patient Advocacy Services**: Some hospitals and healthcare systems have patient advocacy services that can help navigate the system, arrange appointments, and deal with communication issues between healthcare providers.\n\n10. **Legal and Complaint Processes**: If you feel you've been mistreated or neglected by a healthcare provider, consider reaching out to the hospital's patient relations department or your local medical board to file a complaint. This can help ensure that others do not receive the same substandard care in the future.\n\nRemember, your health and well-being are paramount. Don't hesitate to seek help if you feel your condition is worsening or if you're not receiving the care you believe you need."

I went through a few details about these weird \u201cepisodes\u201d I\u2019d been having that I later found out were partial seizures. You can read my first post here Anyway, on 10/7 I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I went to the ER and had a CT and bloodwork- both were unremarkable. I was also given Keppra IV, as well as a Keppra prescription 500mg 2x/day. I also had an MRI and an EEG- both unremarkable as well. Since then I\u2019ve had a few more of these partial seizures. They come at completely random times and the doctors were stumped as to why this suddenly popped up. I have no family history of epilepsy, and never had seizures prior to these starting around mid/late 2019. Never had any crazy fevers as a kid, and have not introduced any new drugs etc. since they started.

        "answer": "I can sense your frustration and concern about the sudden onset of seizures, especially with no clear explanation or family history. It's completely understandable that you're seeking more insight and experiences from others.\n\nGiven your medical history and the tests you've undergone, it's indeed puzzling that the cause of your seizures remains unknown. I'll try to provide some general information and potential avenues to explore, but please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and it's essential to consult with your healthcare team for personalized advice.\n\n1. **Epilepsy diagnosis**: The fact that you've had a grand mal seizure and multiple partial seizures suggests that you may have epilepsy. However, the unremarkable test results (CT, bloodwork, MRI, and EEG) make it challenging to determine the underlying cause.\n2. **Potential contributing factors**: Although you mentioned no new drug introductions, it's essential to consider the possibility that your current medications or substances might be contributing to your seizures. For example:\n\t* **Vaping and weed**: Both can potentially lower the seizure threshold, although the relationship is still being researched.\n\t* **Adderall**: As a stimulant, it may increase the risk of seizures, especially if taken in high doses or combined with other substances.\n\t* **Other medications**: Certain medications, like antidepressants (e.g., Zoloft) and antihistamines (e.g., Xyzal), can also lower the seizure threshold in rare cases.\n3. **Underlying conditions**: Your preexisting conditions, such as Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder, may be contributing to your seizure activity. Some research suggests a link between mental health conditions and epilepsy, although the exact relationship is still unclear.\n4. **Other potential causes**: It's possible that your seizures are related to an underlying condition that hasn't been identified yet, such as:\n\t* **Sleep disorders**: Poor sleep quality or sleep disorders like sleep apnea can increase the risk of seizures.\n\t* **Hormonal changes**: Fluctuations in hormone levels, particularly estrogen, can affect seizure activity in some individuals.\n\t* **Infections or autoimmune disorders**: Certain infections or autoimmune conditions, like meningitis or lupus, can increase the risk of seizures.\n5. **Next steps**: Considering your unremarkable test results, your healthcare team may want to:\n\t* **Repeat EEGs**: Perform additional EEGs to capture more data and potentially identify any patterns or abnormalities.\n\t* **Video EEG monitoring**: Conduct video EEG monitoring to record your seizures and gather more information about their characteristics.\n\t* **Neuropsychological evaluation**: Assess your cognitive function and look for any potential correlations between your seizures and mental health conditions.\n\t* **Medication adjustments**: Review your current medication regimen and consider adjustments or additions to help manage your seizures.\n\nIt's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to explore these possibilities and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, make sure to:\n\n* **Keep a seizure journal**: Record your seizures, including the date, time, duration, and any potential triggers.\n* **Stick to your medication regimen**: Adhere to your prescribed medication schedule and dosages.\n* **Avoid triggers**: Identify and avoid potential seizure triggers, such as stress, lack of sleep, or certain substances.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to follow your healthcare team's guidance and attend all scheduled appointments to ensure your safety and optimal management of your condition.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide more information or point you in the right direction."

        "question": "Basic Information Age: 71 Gender: Male Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: ~70kg Smoking status: Non-smoker for 2 years (smoked for 40 years previously) Medical issues: Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis Duration: Approximately 6-7 years Hi all, My father (71M, about 70kg), was diagnosed with cirrhosis back in 2014 as a result of alcohol abuse. Over the years since, he's had three bouts of esophageal varices (the most recent in January 2020) and four seizures: May 2019, Sept 2019, Jan 19 2021, Feb 23 2021. Things have felt pretty stable since he recovered from his last bout of esophageal varices in 2020, and it was a relatively relaxing year in terms of worrying about his health. While it can be heartbreaking, he has only been drinking a few beers every night and I've had to accept a few years back I can't stop him drinking. During Christmas, he told me he has gone off Xifaxan - which I believe he's been on since January 2020- as he hates going to the bathroom every hour and informed his doctor. He's aware it's for hepatic encephalopathy, however outlines he doesn't need it due to his cognitive functions still relatively in tact: he does the cryptic crossword every day, a sudoku, and can still play a vast range of songs on piano. Moreover, his long term memory of events and trivia seems unchanged. Though, from my observations over the years, there's a decreased lack of insight into the situation, increased short term memory loss, and less fluid intelligence. Following yesterday's seizure, he was prescribed Keppra. I guess what I'm asking is that: is it possible that going off Xifaxan is causing the seizures to return? Can seizures be a symptom of hepatic encephalopathy? Google says it's a rare side effect, but possible. Dad sometimes postulates it's a result of his motorbike accident in 1971 and was recently taking salt tablets due to low salt levels, however I advised him to speak with his GP about this and the GP advised him to stop. So far no doctor has made this connection - or, more accurately, what Dad has told me what the doctor's are saying. He's being sent to a district hospital later this month for an fMRI scan. This is worrying. Usually whenever there's a return to hospital - esophageal varices or seizures - there's a sigh of relief that he survived once again and one doesn't have to worry for while, but now with two seizures a month apart, I'm concerned they'll be more frequent and end up causing a coma and/or death. Ultimately, I asked him today if he would rather have seizures or go to the bathroom every hour. He said he'd rather have seizures as he hated how he felt going to the bathroom. Even if this is the cause, I guess, just like I can't make him quit drinking, I can't force him to go on any medications. Other medication as at November 2020 Propranolol 40 mg antoprazole 40 mg andesartan 16 mg Spiractin 25 mg Mirtazapine 15 mg Thanks in advance.",

        "answer": "I can sense the worry and concern you have for your father's health. It's great that you're actively involved in his care and trying to understand the complexities of his condition. I'll try to provide some insights and potential connections between his stopping Xifaxan and the seizures.\n\n**Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and Seizures**\n\nHepatic encephalopathy is a complication of advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis, which can cause cognitive dysfunction, including changes in mental status, lethargy, and even coma. Seizures are not a typical symptom of hepatic encephalopathy, but they can occur in some cases, particularly in patients with a history of seizures or those with other underlying neurological conditions.\n\n**Xifaxan (Rifaximin) and Seizures**\n\nXifaxan is an antibiotic used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing the amount of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut. While it's not a primary treatment for seizures, some studies suggest that Xifaxan may have a neuroprotective effect and potentially reduce the frequency of seizures in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n**Stopping Xifaxan and Seizure recurrence**\n\nIt's possible that stopping Xifaxan may be contributing to the recurrence of seizures, although this is not a well-established connection. The reduced frequency of seizures while on Xifaxan could be coincidental, or it might be related to the medication's effects on the gut-brain axis. More research is needed to fully understand this potential link.\n\n**Other Potential Factors**\n\nYour father's history of motorbike accident in 1971, recent use of salt tablets, and low salt levels could also be contributing factors to his seizures. Hyponatremia (low sodium levels) can cause seizures, and it's essential to manage this condition properly.\n\n**Current Medications and Seizure Risk**\n\nSome medications can increase the risk of seizures, including:\n\n1. Mirtazapine (15 mg) - While not typically associated with seizures, high doses can increase the risk.\n2. Spiractin (25 mg) - This medication can cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which can increase the risk of seizures.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nGiven the recent seizure and concerns about the potential connection between stopping Xifaxan and seizure recurrence, it's essential to discuss the following with your father's healthcare team:\n\n1. Reinitiate Xifaxan to see if it affects seizure frequency.\n2. Review current medications and their potential interactions.\n3. Monitor sodium levels and manage hyponatremia if necessary.\n4. Consider alternative treatments for hepatic encephalopathy, such as lactulose or other medications.\n5. Follow up on the fMRI scan and any other diagnostic tests to rule out other potential causes of seizures.\n\n**Support and Communication**\n\nIt's great that you're having open conversations with your father about his health. Encourage him to discuss his concerns and preferences with his healthcare team. While you can't force him to take medications, you can continue to support and encourage him to make informed decisions about his care.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It's essential to consult with your father's healthcare team to discuss the specifics of his condition and develop a personalized plan to manage his health.\n\nHow do you think your father will respond to the suggestion of reinitiating Xifaxan or exploring alternative treatments? Have you considered seeking a second opinion or consulting with a specialist, such as a hepatologist or neurologist?"

(no existing medical conditions, no smoking/drugs etc)  Hi, I'm in a bit of a pinch and desperate for some kind of second opinion /advice on this since I'm travelling back home from uni and can't see a GP until I return in October (personal/family reasons).I've been \"passing out\" unexpectedly for short periods of time maybe a few times a month for at least 3 years now but only recently cared enough to dig deeper. It seems that it happens when I'm focusing on a bright light/screen in a dimly lit environment (e.g. it's happened every time I went to a concert in the past half year, 7 times, also in the car at night when looking at bright lights, and watching a presentation on a projector in a dark-ish room). Each time it happens I feel a bit dizzy/nauseous and slow, then my eyes roll and refuse to focus, and eventually my head drops and I'm unconscious for a few seconds to a few minutes. When I regain consciousness I feel quite disoriented and often \"pass out\" again very quickly for several times in succession until removed from the environment. It seems to also take at least several minutes of being exposed to the stimulus before anything happens, in general. I can't really remember accurately since it feels very hazy.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to provide some general guidance, but please remember that I'm not a substitute for a professional medical consultation. It's essential to consult a doctor, especially considering your symptoms have been ongoing for over three years.\n\nThe description of your experiences, particularly the specific triggers such as bright lights in dimly lit environments, suggests a possibility of photosensitive seizures or a condition related to sensory sensitivity. However, the details you've provided could also align with other conditions that cause transient loss of consciousness, which might not necessarily be epilepsy.\n\nGiven the characteristics you've described:\n\n1. **Specific triggers**: Your episodes seem to be triggered by focusing on bright lights/screens in dimly lit environments.\n2. **Preceding symptoms**: Feeling dizzy/nauseous, slow, and having difficulty focusing before losing consciousness.\n3. **Recurring episodes**: Experiencing multiple episodes in quick succession if the trigger persists.\n4. **Duration and recovery**: Episodes last from a few seconds to a few minutes, with disorientation upon regaining consciousness.\n\nTo approach this situation, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Keep a detailed log**: Record every episode, noting the circumstances (environment, time, activities before the episode, etc.), duration, and any symptoms leading up to or following the episode. This can help identify patterns or additional triggers.\n\n2. **Consult a GP**: As soon as possible, even if it's over the phone or via video consultation if you cannot meet in person until October. Provide your GP with the detailed log you've kept, which can be invaluable for diagnosis.\n\n3. **Neurological Evaluation**: Given the suspicion of focal epilepsy or a related condition, ask your GP to refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. This might include EEGs (electroencephalograms) to look for abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can be indicative of epilepsy.\n\n4. **Other Tests**: Depending on the neurologist's findings, other tests such as an MRI of the brain might be ordered to rule out structural causes for your symptoms.\n\n5. **Photosensitivity Testing**: If epilepsy is suspected, especially photosensitive epilepsy, specific testing can be done to assess how your brain reacts to different visual stimuli.\n\nRemember, while these steps can guide you toward understanding and addressing your condition, a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management plan require professional medical evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, consider avoiding triggers as much as possible and ensuring your safety during episodes (e.g., being in a safe environment where you won't hurt yourself if you lose consciousness)."

I'll provide some general information, but please keep in mind that a thorough evaluation by a medical professional is essential in this situation.\n\nThe behavior you described, particularly the unresponsiveness, lethargy, and shaking, could be indicative of a seizure or another neurological event. It's possible that your son experienced a febrile seizure, which is a common type of seizure in infants and young children, often triggered by a fever or illness. However, since you mentioned that your son has no medical conditions and isn't taking any medication, other possibilities should be explored.\n\nThe fact that your son:\n\n1. Woke up screaming, suggesting a possible sudden onset of distress or pain\n2. Was unresponsive with eyes open, indicating a potential alteration in mental status\n3. Shook or had a tremor, which could be a seizure-like activity\n4. Returned to normal after the episode, which is consistent with a post-ictal phase (the period after a seizure)\n\nwarrants further investigation.\n\nGiven that your son's doctor has recommended an EEG (electroencephalogram), which is a test to evaluate the electrical activity of the brain, it's likely that they want to rule out any underlying seizure activity or other neurological conditions.\n\nIn addition to the EEG, the doctor may also:\n\n1. Perform a thorough physical examination to check for any signs of illness, injury, or neurological abnormalities.\n2. Review your son's medical history, including any previous episodes of similar behavior.\n3. Ask about any changes in behavior, appetite, or overall health.\n4.

        "question": "Hi docs, I'm at a loss as to what my best course of action is next. Would love to hear your advice. It's a long, detailed post, but I still left out some stuff to keep it a reasonable read. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or clarify.When I was a teenager I got these weird feelings in my body, and it caused me to basically jerk my hands/arms. The feelings also gave me this weird sensation to fall to the ground. I've never had a full blown seizure, but my neurologist diagnosed me with epilepsy. I was prescribed oxcarbezapine (trileptal) and I took it for many many years. It worked perfectly. Those feelings were completely gone.About two years ago I stopped taking the medication. My life was completely normal up to that point and I've never had any of those feelings basically since I started taking the medication. Also many of the side effects of the medication had subsided completely. It was as if I wasn't taking anything at all. I thought I'd give it a shot at stopping. Worst case scenario I can just get back on it again.It was a great year or so of no issues at all. I thought I was cured.  Then I had a bout of H pylori and I took two rounds of antibiotics + prilosec. Almost as soon as I started taking the antibiotics + prilosec combo, the feelings returned with a vengeance. My arms violently jerked on a couple of occasions. And here's the kicker - the oxcarbezapine I had been taking no longer worked when I went back on it. Worse, the antibiotics gave me recurring acid reflux, which always trigger those epileptic feelings.I immediately changed my diet to keto to help manage the situation, and it mostly worked. I still had the occasional feeling, but it was minor and didn't cause any issues. I spoke to my neurologist around this time and he said it's probably best to just continue managing it with diet and exercise, as he didn't want to put more toxins in my body. I still couldn't really do many normal life stuff like date, travel or go to friends' gatherings, because I was fearful of the feelings rearing up again at a bad time. But at least I had a healthy diet and I was exercising reguarly. I'm pretty healthy otherwise.Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I basically ate a meal with a lotta sugar/carbs in it, and it kicked me out of the low carb ketosis. Immediately the feelings returned again with a vengeance. This time it was even worse. I felt like I had to hold on to something whenever I walked. I might as well be in a wheel chair. The feelings roared inside me.I knew I had to get back into ketosis ASAP. So I fasted immediately, stayed home for a few days, and ate zero carbs. Now I'm feeling a bit better after getting back into ketosis. But the problem is this time, there are still a ton of those feelings remaining. Sometimes I have to stop walking and just stand there, just to wait for the feeling to go away. Other times I've even had to walk weirdly to manage the feelings. Needless to say it is extremely weird in public.  Right now I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Will this go away? If I just keep up the keto and exercise? Should I try a different drug? I feel like whatever side effects any new drug might have will still be worth it. Right now, I basically can only get away with doing stuff by myself. I wouldn't be able to do stuff with others. I would seize up or be afraid of seizing up. I can't really function like this. I'm self employed but if I have to get a regular job (which I have been considering), this could never work.I'm happy to clarify or add any details as needed.Thank you so much in advance",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging time. I'll do my best to provide a helpful and non-medical perspective. Please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and it's essential to consult your neurologist or a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nFrom your detailed post, it seems like you've experienced a complex relationship between your epilepsy, medication, diet, and lifestyle. Here are some observations and potential considerations:\n\n1. **Re-emergence of symptoms**: After stopping oxcarbazepine, you experienced a relatively seizure-free period, but the symptoms returned after the antibiotic and Prilosec treatment. This suggests that your body may still be susceptible to seizures, and certain factors (e.g., medication, diet, or underlying conditions) can trigger them.\n2. **Dietary influence**: Your experience with the keto diet has shown that it can help manage your symptoms to some extent. The fact that a high-carb meal triggered a severe relapse suggests that your body is sensitive to dietary changes.\n3. **Loss of medication efficacy**: The oxcarbazepine no longer being effective is concerning. This might indicate that your body has developed a tolerance or that the underlying condition has changed.\n4. **Current situation**: Despite returning to the keto diet and fasting, you're still experiencing persistent symptoms. This indicates that the current management strategy might not be sufficient to control your seizures.\n\nConsidering these points, here are some potential next steps to discuss with your neurologist:\n\n* **Re-evaluate medication options**: Given the loss of efficacy of oxcarbazepine, your neurologist might consider alternative medications or combination therapies to help manage your seizures.\n* **Dietary adjustments**: While the keto diet has been helpful, you may need to fine-tune your dietary approach to better manage your symptoms. A registered dietitian or a healthcare professional can help you optimize your diet.\n* **Lifestyle modifications**: In addition to diet, other lifestyle factors like stress management, sleep, and exercise may impact your seizures. Your neurologist can help you identify potential areas for improvement.\n* **Further testing or evaluation**: Depending on your neurologist's assessment, they might recommend additional tests (e.g., EEG, blood work, or imaging studies) to better understand your condition and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n* **Consider a multidisciplinary approach**: You may benefit from a comprehensive evaluation by a team of healthcare professionals, including a neurologist, dietitian, and therapist, to address the various aspects of your condition.\n\nIt's essential to have an open and honest discussion with your neurologist about your concerns, symptoms, and quality of life.

        "question": "Background info: Hi I\u2019m at 36 year old male, I have epilepsy and take medication for it. I received a micro discectomy at the start of the month and a second surgery to due to increased pain 5 day ago. I\u2019m also currently taking gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. Five days ago, in the hospital, I was in a lot of pain and was receiving pain medication through an IV. The nurses were having a lot of difficulty placing the IVs in me, and my IV was changed about four times. I\u2019ve been home for about five days and yesterday two of the areas where the IVs where placed developed a small rash.Right where the needle entered. The first one is located on my posterior palm below the digits 1 and 2 The other is located on my posterior forearm on the ulnar just distal my elbow. The rashes are red, slightly elevated and very itchy.Should I be worried? Is this an allergic reaction to something? Is there any home/over-the-counter remedy I can try before before making a doctor\u2019s appointment. Thank you in advance",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll provide some general insights to help you navigate this situation. Given your recent medical history, it's essential to approach this with caution.\n\nThe rashes at the IV sites could be caused by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Phlebitis**: Irritation or inflammation of the vein, which can occur due to repeated IV insertions, catheter placement, or infusion of certain medications.\n2. **Allergic reaction**: A reaction to the IV medication, tape, or antiseptic solution used to clean the skin before insertion.\n3. **Infection**: Although less likely, it's possible to develop an infection at the IV site, especially if the skin wasn't properly cleaned or if the IV was left in place for an extended period.\n4. **Skin irritation**: Reactions to the adhesive or materials used in the IV dressing or tape.\n\nConsidering your current medications, gabapentin, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine, it's possible that you may be more susceptible to skin reactions or interactions.\n\nBefore seeking medical attention, you can try some over-the-counter remedies to alleviate the symptoms:\n\n1. **Apply topical hydrocortisone cream** (1%) to reduce inflammation and itching.\n2. **Use calamine lotion** to soothe the skin and relieve itching.\n3. **Apply a cold compress** to reduce itching and inflammation.\n4. **Avoid scratching** the affected areas to prevent further irritation and potential infection.\n\nHowever, if you experience any of the following, **seek medical attention promptly**:\n\n* Increased redness, swelling, or warmth around the affected area\n* Pus or discharge from the affected area\n* Fever (above 100.4\u00b0F/38\u00b0C)\n* Increased pain or tenderness at the IV site\n* Difficulty moving the affected arm or hand\n* Worsening of symptoms despite trying home remedies\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of caution, especially considering your recent surgeries and medication regimen. Schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor or the hospital where you received treatment to have the rashes evaluated. They can assess the situation and provide guidance on the best course of action.\n\nIn the meantime, keep an eye on the rashes and monitor your overall condition. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider."

        "question": "My mother (age <60yo, no familial history of dementia) had a mild cognitive impairment since the surgery 12 years ago, but a year ago she was diagnosed with a depressive disorder and presented some amnesic complaints that were attributed to her past medical history (she is currently being followed in psychiatry). A few months ago I started observing a difficulty in transmitting any kind of information to others (comprehension is maintained) and sense of overwhelming when she has different tasks to do in the same day, but she keep being independent at her domestic daily activities.I don't know if this is my med student clinical reasoning or my overthinking, but (and as a future doctor), is it possible to make a differential diagnosis between demential syndromes or other diseases (excluding obvious imaging or analytical findings)? Which is the role of the classical mini-mental examination test + clock test at screening patients for dementia?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "A very thoughtful and informed question! As a future doctor, it's great that you're considering the nuances of your mother's condition. I'll provide an overview of the differential diagnosis and the role of screening tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Test.\n\n**Differential diagnosis:**\n\nGiven your mother's history and symptoms, several possibilities should be considered:\n\n1. **Depression-related cognitive impairment**: As she has a diagnosed depressive disorder, it's possible that her cognitive symptoms are related to depression. Depression can cause cognitive impairment, including difficulties with attention, memory, and executive functions.\n2. **Post-operative cognitive dysfunction**: Although it's been 12 years since the surgery, some people may experience persistent cognitive impairment after surgery, especially if there were any perioperative complications.\n3. **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**: Your mother's symptoms, such as difficulty with transmitting information and sense of overwhelm, could be indicative of MCI, which is a condition characterized by noticeable cognitive decline that is not severe enough to interfere with daily life.\n4. **Early stages of dementia**: Although less likely given her age and lack of familial history, it's essential to consider the possibility of early-stage dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.\n5. **Other conditions**: Other potential causes of cognitive impairment, such as sleep disorders, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiencies), should also be considered.\n\n**Role of screening tests:**\n\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Test are widely used screening tools to assess cognitive function:\n\n1. **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)**: The MMSE is a brief, 11-question test that evaluates various cognitive functions, including:\n\t* Orientation\n\t* Registration (repeating words)\n\t* Attention and calculation\n\t* Memory (recall)\n\t* Language\n\t* Visuospatial skills\nThe MMSE is a useful screening tool to identify cognitive impairment, but it has limitations, such as:\n\t+ Ceiling effect: High-functioning individuals may score maximally, making it difficult to detect subtle cognitive decline.\n\t+ Floor effect: Severely impaired individuals may score minimally, making it challenging to assess the extent of cognitive decline.\n2. **Clock Test**: The Clock Test, also known as the Clock Drawing Test, assesses:\n\t* Visuospatial skills\n\t* Executive functions (planning, organization)\n\t* Attention\nThe Clock Test can help identify cognitive impairment, particularly in the areas of visuospatial skills and executive functions.\n\n**Interpretation and next steps:**\n\nWhen interpreting the results of these screening tests, consider the following:\n\n* A low MMSE score or abnormal Clock Test performance may indicate cognitive impairment, but it's essential to consider the individual's educational background, baseline cognitive function, and any potential biases.\n* A normal MMSE score or Clock Test performance does not necessarily rule out cognitive impairment, as these tests have limitations.\n* If your mother's screening test results suggest cognitive impairment, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by a specialist (e.g., neurologist, geriatrician, or psychiatrist) is necessary to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\n\nAs a future doctor, it's essential to remember that cognitive impairment can have multiple causes, and a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, is necessary to determine the underlying cause of your mother's symptoms.\n\nIn your mother's case, considering her depressive disorder and past medical history, it's possible that her cognitive symptoms are related to her depression or other underlying factors. A comprehensive evaluation by a specialist will help determine the best course of action and guide further management."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to help you understand your recent blood work results and potential symptoms.\n\n**High Blood Cell Count:**\nYour blood work shows elevated levels of:\n\n1. Hemoglobin (Hb): 16.4 g/dL (normal range: 12-15.5 g/dL for women)\n2. Red Blood Cell Count (RBC): 5.22 million cells/\u03bcL (normal range: 4.32-5.72 million cells/\u03bcL for women, but this can vary depending on the lab)\n3. Hematocrit (Hct): 47.8% (normal range: 36-48% for women, but this can also vary)\n\nThese elevated values indicate that you have a condition called erythrocytosis or polycythemia, which means you have an increased number of red blood cells in your blood. This can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Primary polycythemia (e.g., polycythemia vera, a rare blood disorder)\n* Secondary polycythemia (e.g., caused by chronic hypoxia, sleep apnea, or certain medications)\n* Other medical conditions (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism)\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe symptoms you've noticed over the past 2-3 months could be related to your elevated red blood cell count or other factors:\n\n1. **Night sweats**: This can be a symptom of various conditions, including polycythemia, menopause, or other hormonal changes.\n2. **Itchiness after hot baths or showers**: Pruritus (itching) is a common symptom of polycythemia, which can be caused by the increased blood cell count.\n3. **Fatigue**: As you mentioned, this could be related to various factors, including vitamin D deficiency, sleep disturbances, or the elevated red blood cell count.\n\n**Lamictal and Red Blood Cell Count:**\nLamictal (lamotrigine) is not typically associated with changes in red blood cell count. However, it's essential to discuss your medication with your doctor, as some medications can affect blood cell production or increase the risk of blood clotting.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nIt's crucial to follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss your blood work results and symptoms. They may recommend:\n\n1. **Repeat blood work**: To confirm the elevations in your red blood cell count and hemoglobin.\n2. **Thyroid function tests**: To rule out hypothyroidism, which can contribute to elevated red blood cell count.\n3. **Sleep study**: To evaluate for sleep apnea, which can cause secondary polycythemia.\n4. **Physical examination**: To check for signs of splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) or other physical abnormalities.\n5. **Referral to a hematologist**: If your primary care physician suspects a underlying hematological disorder.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just potential steps, and your healthcare provider will determine the best course of action based on your individual situation.\n\nPlease discuss your concerns and symptoms with your doctor, and ask questions like:\n\n* What could be causing my elevated red blood cell count?\n* Are my symptoms related to my blood work results?\n* What additional tests or evaluations do I need to undergo?\n* How will we monitor my condition, and what are the potential treatment options?\n\nI hope this information helps you understand your situation better. Remember to consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice and guidance."

        "answer": "I'll do my best to provide a neutral and informative response.\n\nIt sounds like you've been experiencing a wide range of symptoms, including those related to your diagnosed conditions (epilepsy, narcolepsy with cataplexy, and Raynaud's with erythromelalgia) as well as other symptoms that are not fully explained. I'll try to break down some of the key points and offer some potential insights.\n\n**Diagnosed conditions:**\n\n1. **Epilepsy**: Your epilepsy diagnosis dates back to 2007. You've had episodes where you can hear everything, but can't talk, and your eyes roll back. These episodes are sometimes accompanied by shaking, lip drooping, and muscle heaviness.\n2. **Narcolepsy with cataplexy**: Diagnosed in 2009. You experience sudden, brief episodes of muscle weakness (cataplexy), often triggered by strong emotions.\n3. **Raynaud's with erythromelalgia**: Diagnosed in 2016. This condition affects blood flow to your extremities and can cause pain, numbness, and tingling.\n\n**Other symptoms:**\n\n1. **Pins and needles**: You experience pins and needles sensations in various parts of your body, including your stomach, face, eyes, extremities, and head. These sensations can occur at random times, including during exercise, sex, or while sitting on the toilet.\n2. **Muscle spasms**: You occasionally experience muscle spasms that feel like they're stemming from your spine, especially after lying down.\n3. **Internal shaking**: Your body sometimes feels like it's shaking or vibrating, usually when you're tired.\n4. **Urge incontinence**: You've struggled with constipation and, as a result, experience occasional urge incontinence.\n5. **Post-nasal drip**: Your left nostril sometimes drips or runs, which your primary doctor attributes to post-nasal drip.\n6. **Brain fog**: You experience brain fog, but taking Nuvigil helps improve your symptoms.\n7. **Rapid heartbeat and shakiness**: You sometimes feel rushed, anxious, and experience rapid heartbeat, shakiness, and difficulty reading (words appear to be in another language).\n8. **Cognitive difficulties**: During episodes, you may struggle to recall what happened, and your speech may be affected.\n\n**New medication:**\n\n1. **Vimpat**: Your neurologist has prescribed Vimpat (lacosamide) to help manage your epilepsy and potentially other symptoms.\n\n**Potential insights and questions:**\n\n1. **Complex condition overlap**: Your symptoms suggest a complex interplay between your diagnosed conditions and other, potentially related conditions. For example, your narcolepsy and cataplexy might contribute to your muscle weakness, while your Raynaud's and erythromelalgia could be related to your pins and needles sensations.\n2. **Central nervous system involvement**: Many of your symptoms, such as your epilepsy, muscle spasms, and internal shaking, suggest central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Your neurologist may want to explore further testing or consultations to rule out other CNS conditions.\n3. **Sleep and fatigue**: Your sleep patterns, including your switch from Xyrem to Ambien, may impact your symptoms. You may want to discuss your sleep habits and fatigue levels with your neurologist.\n4. **Lifestyle and exercise**: Your increased physical activity and strength training may be beneficial, but it's essential to monitor your body's response to exercise and adjust your routine as needed.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Follow-up with your neurologist**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to discuss your response to Vimpat, any changes in your symptoms, and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Tracking your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers, can help your neurologist better understand your conditions and make informed decisions about your care.\n3. **Explore additional testing or consultations**: Depending on your symptoms and medical history, your neurologist may recommend further testing, such as an EMG (electromyogram) or consultations with other specialists, like a rheumatologist or a sleep specialist.\n\nPlease consult your neurologist or primary care physician before making any changes to your treatment plan or medication regimen. They can provide personalized guidance and help you navigate the complex interactions between your conditions."

What does this mean, and what do you think the prognosis could be? I've been experiencing memory loss, depersonalization, reduced consciousness, and depression since getting COVID and having a vaccine reaction earlier this year. However, I also used CBD oil for three months the year before to ill effect (it caused depersonalization and amnesia) and was diagnosed with depression in the past, which may or may not contribute. Things really worsened after I had an mRNA vaccine, so I think that the virus could've been near the hippocampus and gotten attacked afterward. My information: 24F, 110 pounds, conditions: epilepsy, history of COVID, history of vaccine reaction, medications: Trileptal, location of problem: brain, duration: 9 months",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll try to break down the Neuroquant results and provide some insights, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with a qualified healthcare expert, such as a neurologist or a neuroradiologist, to get a personalized interpretation and prognosis.\n\nThe Neuroquant results you provided are based on normative percentiles, which compare your brain structure volumes to a healthy population. Here's a brief summary:\n\n1. **Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOS) - 32**: This score is relatively low, indicating that the hippocampus may not be occupying its expected space within the temporal lobe. A low HOS can suggest hippocampal atrophy or volume loss, but in your case, the hippocampal volume is reported as normal (72). This discrepancy may indicate that the hippocampus is not properly positioned or is being compressed by surrounding structures.\n2. **Hippocampi - 72**: As mentioned, this suggests that the hippocampal volume is within the normal range.\n3. **Superior Lateral Ventricles - 94**: This is a relatively high percentile, indicating that the superior lateral ventricles are larger than expected. Enlarged ventricles can be a sign of brain atrophy or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) accumulation.\n4. **Inferior Lateral Ventricles - 74**: This is within the normal range.\n\nConsidering your symptoms, medical history, and Neuroquant results, here are some potential interpretations:\n\n* The low Hippocampal Occupancy Score, combined with normal hippocampal volume, may suggest that the hippocampus is not functioning properly, despite its normal size. This could be related to your memory loss and depersonalization symptoms.\n* The enlarged superior lateral ventricles (94 percentile) may indicate that there is some degree of brain atrophy or CSF accumulation, which could be contributing to your symptoms.\n* The COVID infection and vaccine reaction may have triggered an inflammatory response or autoimmune reaction that affected the brain, particularly the hippocampus. This could be related to the observed changes in your Neuroquant results.\n* Your history of epilepsy, depression, and CBD oil use may also be contributing factors to your current symptoms and Neuroquant results.\n\nPrognosis is difficult to predict without more information and a thorough medical evaluation. However, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n* The fact that you've been experiencing symptoms for 9 months suggests that there may be some degree of persistent brain dysfunction or inflammation.\n* The combination of COVID infection, vaccine reaction, and pre-existing conditions (epilepsy, depression) may have increased your risk for developing neurological symptoms.\n* The Neuroquant results suggest that there may be some degree of hippocampal dysfunction or brain atrophy, which could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nTo better understand your condition and develop an effective treatment plan, I recommend that you consult with a neurologist or a neuroradiologist who can:\n\n1. Review your Neuroquant results in detail and correlate them with your clinical symptoms.\n2. Evaluate your medical history, including your COVID infection, vaccine reaction, epilepsy, depression, and CBD oil use.\n3. Perform additional diagnostic tests, such as MRI or functional MRI (fMRI), to assess brain function and structure.\n4. Discuss potential treatment options, such as cognitive rehabilitation, medication adjustments, or other interventions, to address your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n\nRemember, this is a complex and individualized situation, and a thorough medical evaluation is essential to determine the best course of action."

Please consult your healthcare provider before making any decisions.\n\n**GBS and COVID-19 vaccines:**\n\n1. **Background**: GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder that can occur after certain infections or, in rare cases, after vaccination. The risk of GBS after vaccination is extremely low.\n2. **Data on COVID-19 vaccines**: Several studies and surveillance systems have monitored the risk of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination. While the data is still emerging, here are some key findings:\n\t* A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (October 2021) analyzed data from the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and found that the risk of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was approximately 1.4-2.5 cases per million doses administered.\n\t* A study published in the journal Lancet Neurology (February 2022) analyzed data from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and found that the risk of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was approximately 1.1-2.2 cases per million doses administered.\n\t* A review of data from the WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (November 2021) noted that the risk of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was \"very low\" and similar to the risk observed with other vaccines.\n3. **Comparison between vaccine brands**: The available data does not suggest a significant difference in the risk of GBS between different COVID-19 vaccine brands. However, it's essential to note that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been more extensively studied, and the data on other vaccines, such as Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) and AstraZeneca's, is still emerging.\n\n**Vaccine brand options:**\n\n1. **mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna)**: These vaccines have been extensively studied, and their safety profiles are well-established. They are considered to have a lower risk of GBS compared to other vaccine types.\n2. **Adenovirus vector vaccines (J&J and AstraZeneca)**: These vaccines have also been studied, but the data on their safety profile is still emerging. The risk of GBS with these vaccines is considered to be low, but it's essential to continue monitoring their safety.\n3. **Protein-based vaccines (e.g., Novavax)**: These vaccines are a newer type of COVID-19 vaccine, and their safety profile is still being established.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Consult your healthcare provider**: Discuss your individual risk factors, including your epilepsy and concerns about GBS, with your healthcare provider. They can help you make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination.\n2. **Consider the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine**: Based on the available data, these mRNA vaccines may have a lower risk of GBS compared to other vaccine types.\n3. **Weigh the benefits and risks**: While the risk of GBS is a concern, it's essential to consider the overall benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, including protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death.\n4. **Monitor for symptoms**: If you do decide to get vaccinated, be aware of the symptoms of GBS, such as muscle weakness, numbness, or tingling, and seek medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your individual situation. They can help you weigh the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination and make an informed decision."

They can help evaluate the possibility of an autoimmune disorder, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, which can cause muscle inflammation and weakness.\n2. **Repeat and expand lab tests**: While your neurologist may only want to repeat the MRI once a year, you may want to discuss the following additional lab tests with your healthcare provider:\n\t* Repeat CK levels and other muscle enzyme tests to monitor for recurrence.\n\t* Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to evaluate liver and kidney function, as well as electrolyte imbalances.\n\t* Inflammatory marker tests, such as ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and CRP (C-Reactive Protein), to assess for underlying inflammation.\n\t* Autoantibody tests, such as ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) and RF (Rheumatoid Factor), to evaluate for autoimmune disorders.\n3. **Explore heat intolerance**: Your extreme heat intolerance may be related to an underlying condition, such as:\n\t* Dysautonomia (autonomic nervous system dysfunction): This can cause abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating responses to heat.\n\t* Mitochondrial disorders: These can affect energy production and lead to heat intolerance.\n\t* Hormonal imbalances: Your low testosterone levels may be contributing to heat intolerance.\n4. **Consider a functional medicine approach**: A functional medicine practitioner may help identify underlying factors contributing to your symptoms, such as:\n\t* Nutrient deficiencies or imbalances (e.g., magnesium, CoQ10).\n\t* Gut health and microbiome imbalances.\n\t* Environmental toxin exposure (e.g., heavy metals).\n5. **Keep a symptom journal**: Tracking your symptoms, including when they occur, their severity, and any potential triggers, can help identify patterns and correlations.\n6. **Seek a second opinion**: If you feel that your current healthcare team is not adequately addressing your concerns, consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist, such as a neurologist or rheumatologist, at a different institution.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. Be sure to discuss any new symptoms, concerns, or test results with your doctor to ensure you're receiving the most comprehensive care possible."

        "question": "Hong Kong,18M On 27 August I had my first seizure, it happened at a restaurant which go for lunch nearly every day. The waiter there told me she saw me fell suddenly and seizing on the ground. After I \u2018woke up\u2019 I found my self yelling and struggle to leave the restaurant. Then slowly regain consciousness and paramedics asked me to unlock my phone in order to contact my parents. They also me that they called the police for help.I have no idea about what I did during that time... It makes me feel so ashamed.... After one day of hospitalization I was discharged with no medication given. I was also given a discharge slip mentioning the diagnosis was epilepsy Just a few days my second seizure occurred, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I saw paramedics standing in front of my bed. Then nothing else. Then the next thing I could remember was , I am inside a ambulance. I can feel my brain like a computer lagging. It took me around 20-30s to recall why I was in an ambulance. After one day of hospitalisation, I discharged with Lamictal prescribed. After gradually increasing the dose, now I have to take medication two times per day, 100mg in total. I can start to feel the side effects. It makes me memory decline.. It makes me feel so frustrated. I did not want my friends to know. So I talked about my feelings on other forums anonymously. The reply I got was, are sure you are suffering from epilepsy? (That person)I have the same experience before too! Turns out he was diagnosed vasovagal episode. So now I am doubting if I am suffering from epilepsy or not? I really hate taking that Lamictal and wish to get rid off it..",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I can sense the frustration, uncertainty, and shame you're feeling about your recent experiences. It's completely understandable to have doubts about your diagnosis, especially when someone else's similar experience turned out to be something different.\n\nFirstly, please know that it's great that you're taking your medication as prescribed, even if you're not feeling entirely convinced about the diagnosis. It's essential to continue taking Lamictal as directed by your doctor, at least for now, to help manage your symptoms.\n\nRegarding your concerns about the diagnosis, it's not uncommon for people to question their diagnosis, especially when they're not feeling entirely sure about what's happening to their body. Vasovagal episodes can indeed present with similar symptoms to seizures, so it's natural to wonder if that might be a possibility.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that your doctor has diagnosed you with epilepsy based on their professional assessment and the information available to them. While it's possible that there might be other explanations for your symptoms, it's essential to trust your doctor's expertise and judgment.\n\nThat being said, if you're still feeling uncertain or uncomfortable about your diagnosis, you may want to consider seeking a second opinion from another neurologist or epilepsy specialist. They can review your case, ask additional questions, and potentially order further tests to confirm or rule out other conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, I would encourage you to keep a seizure diary or a journal to track your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers you notice. This can help you better understand your condition and provide valuable information to your doctor.\n\nRegarding your concerns about the side effects of Lamictal, it's common for people to experience some side effects when starting a new medication. Memory decline is a potential side effect of Lamictal, but it's usually mild and temporary. If you're finding it's significantly impacting your daily life, you may want to discuss this with your doctor to see if there are any adjustments that can be made to your medication regimen.\n\nLastly, please don't feel ashamed about your condition or feel like you need to hide it from your friends. Epilepsy is a common condition, and there's nothing to be embarrassed about. If you do decide to share your diagnosis with your friends, they may be more supportive and understanding than you think.\n\nKeep in mind that you're not alone in this journey. There are many resources available to support you, including epilepsy organizations, online forums, and support groups. Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it.\n\nHow do you feel about seeking a second opinion or discussing your concerns with your doctor? Is there anything specific that's holding you back from talking to your friends about your diagnosis?"

        "question": "My boyfriend (82kg, about 176cm tall) has had panic attacks that look like seizures since he was 16. He is now 31. During those attacks, which are primarily triggered by his fear of needles and medicinal procedures, he loses consciousness. He describes it as \"the light going further and further away until I'm in a black void and there is a hammering noise in my head\". He also told me that sometimes he kicks around and trembles and shakes while he is out of consciousness. He was tested for epilepsy twice, has had several blood tests. His attacks only happen when he is in an anxious situation.He did take drugs like weed and speed as a teenager, he quit smoking in January this year. He has depression and anxiety officially diagnosed as well as panic disorder.A few weeks ago I witnessed such an attack for the first time ever. And I thought I was prepared. But suddenly his face turned purple. So I called an ambulance. He was brought to the hospital and they gave him medicine to calm him down ( I think it was opioids) so they could test his blood and stuff and it all came back normal, there is also still no sign for epilepsy. He is sleeping well, he is eating well, he is drinking well. Therapy and medicine have already been recommended to him many times. He's had CBT, but they never really did any confrontation therapy with him aside from drawing blood from him with a needle, which went well.",

        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, so I can't provide a diagnosis or specific treatment recommendations. However, I can offer some general information and insights that might be helpful.\n\nThe symptoms your boyfriend experiences, such as losing consciousness, feeling like he's in a \"black void,\" and hearing a \"hammering noise\" in his head, along with physical reactions like kicking, trembling, and shaking, are concerning and warrant medical attention. It's good that he has been tested for epilepsy and other conditions, and that he has been diagnosed with anxiety, panic disorder, and depression.\n\nGiven his history of substance use, particularly in his teenage years, it's possible that his brain chemistry and anxiety responses may have been affected. Quitting smoking in January could also be a factor, as nicotine withdrawal can contribute to anxiety.\n\nThe episode you witnessed, where his face turned purple, is alarming and suggests that his body may be experiencing a significant stress response. The hospital's administration of medication to calm him down was likely necessary to prevent further complications.\n\nConsidering his diagnosis of panic disorder and anxiety, it's not surprising that his attacks are triggered by specific situations, such as fear of needles and medical procedures. The fact that he has had CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) but not confrontation therapy (also known as exposure therapy) may be relevant. Confrontation therapy can be an effective way to address specific phobias, such as a fear of needles.\n\nIt might be helpful for your boyfriend to:\n\n1. **Discuss his treatment plan with his therapist**: Ensure that his therapist is aware of the severity of his panic attacks and the triggers. They may need to adjust his treatment plan to include more exposure therapy or other techniques to address his specific phobias.\n2. **Consider a psychiatry evaluation**: A psychiatrist can reassess his medication regimen and potentially adjust it to better manage his anxiety and panic disorder.\n3. **Explore relaxation techniques**: Encourage your boyfriend to learn and practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, to help manage his anxiety in triggering situations.\n4. **Support network**: Having a strong support network, including friends, family, and support groups, can help him cope with his anxiety and panic disorder.\n5. **Emergency plan**: Develop an emergency plan with his healthcare provider, including what to do during a panic attack, such as calling emergency services or administering medication.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with a medical professional for personalized advice and guidance. Encourage your boyfriend to schedule a follow-up appointment with his healthcare provider to discuss his recent episode and develop a plan to manage his anxiety and panic disorder.\n\nHow do you think your boyfriend would feel about exploring these options, and what support can you offer him in this process?"

My primary doctor told me this was unusual and shouldn\u2019t be because of my medications so she told me to get an MRI on my brain.I have gotten an MRI on my brain when I was 14 and they found nothing unusual.I also have some neurological disorders, such as ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and I also had a tic disorder in the past and have occasionally had mild non-epileptic seizures. I\u2019ve never experienced this before.I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any idea what this could be and if it sounds seriousSex: Female, age: 21, height: 5\u20193, weight: 109 lbs",

        "answer": "I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to investigate these unusual symptoms! I'll provide some insights and possible explanations, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and only a thorough evaluation by a specialist can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nThe symptoms you're experiencing, often referred to as \"brain zaps\" or \"electric shock sensations,\" are a complex phenomenon that can be caused by various factors. Given your medical history and current symptoms, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Medication-related issues**: Although your primary doctor thinks it's unlikely, it's still possible that the Straterra (atomoxetine) is contributing to these symptoms, especially if you've recently gotten back into a regular routine after a period of inconsistent use. Atomoxetine can cause changes in brain chemistry, and its effects may be more noticeable when you resume taking it regularly.\n2. **Neurological disorders**: Your history of ADHD, OCD, Misophonia, and tic disorder suggests that you may have an underlying predisposition to neurological symptoms. These conditions can sometimes contribute to abnormal brain activity, which might manifest as brain zaps.\n3. **Non-epileptic seizures**: You've had mild non-epileptic seizures in the past, and it's possible that these brain zaps are related to a similar underlying mechanism.\n4. **Migraines or other headache disorders**: Some people experience electrical shock-like sensations as a migraine aura or as part of a migraine episode.\n5. **Anxiety or stress**: High levels of stress and anxiety can contribute to unusual physical sensations, including brain zaps.\n6. **Sleep-related issues**: The fact that these symptoms occur when you're falling asleep suggests that they might be related to sleep-stage transitions or sleep disorders like sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or periodic limb movement disorder.\n7. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Lyme disease, or vitamin deficiencies (e.g., magnesium or vitamin B12), can cause similar symptoms.\n\nGiven your history of a normal brain MRI at age 14, it's possible that the current symptoms are not directly related to a structural brain abnormality. However, it's still important to rule out any new or worsening conditions, which is why your primary doctor recommended an updated MRI.\n\nTo further investigate these symptoms, you may want to:\n\n* Keep a symptom journal to track when the brain zaps occur, any potential triggers, and any other symptoms you experience.\n* Discuss your symptoms with a neurologist, who can assess your overall neurological health and provide a more informed opinion on the possible causes.\n* Consider consulting a sleep specialist to evaluate potential sleep-related issues.\n* Review your medication regimen with your doctor to ensure that you're taking the Straterra as prescribed and to discuss any potential interactions with other medications.\n\nRemember that it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to unusual symptoms. By seeking medical attention and undergoing further evaluation, you'll be able to determine the underlying cause of these brain zaps and develop a plan to manage them.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and this is not a substitute for personalized medical advice. It's essential to consult with your doctor or a specialist to discuss your specific situation and determine the best course of action."

        "answer": "I'll try to address your concerns and provide some insights.\n\nFirstly, it's great that your MRI report is normal. This suggests that there are no visible structural abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your symptoms. However, it's essential to understand that a normal MRI doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of neurological conditions.\n\nMyoclonic Epilepsy and Motor Tics are both complex conditions that can have various underlying causes. While an MRI can help identify some structural issues, it might not detect more subtle or functional abnormalities.\n\nConsidering your symptoms and medical history, here are a few possibilities to explore:\n\n1. **Myoclonic Epilepsy**: Although your MRI is normal, it's still possible that you might have Myoclonic Epilepsy. This condition can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical assessment, EEG (electroencephalogram) results, and response to medication. Your doctor might consider ordering an EEG to further evaluate your brain activity.\n2. **Motor Tics**: Although the medication isn't working, it's possible that your symptoms are related to Motor Tics. Sometimes, it takes trial and error to find the right medication or dosage. Your doctor might consider adjusting your medication or exploring other treatment options, such as behavioral therapy or lifestyle changes.\n3. **Other conditions**: There are other conditions that could be causing your body jerks, such as:\n\t* **Anxiety-related symptoms**: Your Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks could be contributing to your body jerks. Sometimes, anxiety can manifest physically, including muscle tension or twitches.\n\t* **ADHD-related symptoms**: Some people with ADHD experience motor symptoms, such as fidgeting or restlessness, which could be mistaken for Myoclonic Epilepsy or Motor Tics.\n\t* **Other medical conditions**: Certain conditions, like hypothyroidism, pre-diabetes, or medication side effects, might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nTo better understand your symptoms and address your concerns, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Discuss your concerns with your doctor**: Share your worries and questions with your doctor, and ask them to explain their thought process and next steps.\n2. **Explore EEG testing**: If your doctor hasn't already, they might consider ordering an EEG to evaluate your brain activity and help diagnose or rule out Myoclonic Epilepsy.\n3. **Keep a symptom journal**: Tracking your body jerks, anxiety, and other symptoms can help you identify patterns or potential triggers.\n4. **Consider a neurologist referral**: If your primary care physician is unsure about your diagnosis or treatment, a neurologist might provide additional expertise and guidance.\n5. **Address your anxiety and ADHD**: Continue working on managing your Anxiety Disorder, panic attacks, and ADHD symptoms, as these conditions can impact your overall well-being and potentially contribute to your body jerks.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. While a normal MRI is reassuring, it's crucial to explore other possibilities and find the right treatment approach for your specific situation.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and my response is intended to provide general information and support.

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information that might be helpful. Pepto-Bismol Max contains bismuth subsalicylate, which is generally safe when used as directed. However, taking a large dose in one swallow, potentially up to the maximum daily dosage of 120mL, could be a concern.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of salicylate toxicity (which can occur with excessive bismuth subsalicylate intake) include ringing in the ears (tinnitus), confusion, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, seizures, coma, or even death. Given your epilepsy and use of carbamazapine, it's possible that some of these symptoms might be harder to distinguish from your usual condition.\r\n\r\nConsidering you're a 28-year-old male, 5'6\" (168 cm), and weigh about 160 lbs (73 kg), and you don't seem to have experienced any new or worsening symptoms since the incident, the risk of severe toxicity might be lower. Nonetheless, because of your underlying medical condition and medication, it would be prudent to consult with your healthcare provider or a poison control center for personalized advice.\r\n\r\nThey can assess your specific situation, consider your epilepsy and medication regimen, and provide guidance on whether any further action, such as monitoring or potential treatment, is necessary.

        "question": "My girlfriend and I are at the end of our rope. Age: 24, height: 171 cm, weight: 50 kg She was vaccinated with Biontech for the first time in August. She passed out in the waiting room after 15 minutes, so she fainted. 3 weeks later it happened again. Ambulance was called, but in the hospital no cause could be found.Not thinking much of it at the time, she had a second vaccination in September, again Biontech. Since then - and I am not exaggerating here - she keels over several times a day, uncontrolled and absolutely randomized, and is unconscious between 10 and 30 minutes.During her unconsciousness she hyperventilates, unconsciously of course. In addition, she convulses at times, but very tentatively. For example, within 15 minutes she convulses 3 times for about 3 seconds at a time. The hyperventilating goes on for several minutes. If I keep up the same breathing speed during this, I have the feeling of suffocating.She was already 2 times over more than a week in the hospital, where the heart and the brain were examined (MRI, CT,...). Both times nothing was found. I suppose that an examination during an attack would be useful, but somehow the doctors don't seem to think so.  We have been to neurologists and family doctors besides the hospital. Even a \"systematic\" family doctor who prescribed some homeopathic thing.No remedy let alone diagnosis has been found yet, neither epilepsy nor narcolepsy. Nothing.Now for other aspects: - She has a headache almost continuously, but before the attacks it gets stronger - Her vision on both eyes gets worse before the attacks - She feels the left side of her body less, including her arms and legs before the attacks. - She gets dizzy before attacksShe can minimally fight it, but not for long. It can happen while lying down or standing up. But especially when she is physically exerting herself. If she lies down one evening, it is less likely to happen. If she fights it during the day, the attacks are longer and more severe in the evening.Sometimes it is right after eating or drinking - she also can no longer drink and eat large amounts at the same time. As a result, she consumes very few calories and continues to lose weight - she is already extremely thin and really should not lose any more weight.She can hardly concentrate on her studies. She can't go out by herself anymore because she could fall over at any time. The whole everyday life is insanely restricted. In principle, the disease currently dominates everything.She reacts extremely badly to medication. She can't take headache pills because they make her fall over. Even things prescribed by doctors make her faint right away. I bought carbohydrate powder - she passes out from that too.She has no mental illnesses. She is not depressed, has no anxiety, and has no mental issues with her weight or anything like that. I really can't imagine that this is psychosomatic based - especially because the connection with vaccination is so clear.  We are both absolutely not anti-vaccination and don't believe that there was anything weird in it. She even wanted to get boostered, but we are too afraid that it would get worse.We had hoped that the attacks would lessen as the vaccine effect wore off. But it seems more likely to get even worse over time.This is psychologically very stressful and also makes me afraid to go out with her because I never know in which situation I have to intervene right away. Partly she has already hit the ground while standing unchecked.We really don't know what to do. Is there anyone with experience reports on this or any kind of clue what else we could do? Any doctor, any diagnosis, any kind of remedy?She and I are both 100% aware that it can't go on like this in the long run. And she would also commit suicide at some point if it doesn't get better. And I can absolutely understand that. A normal life is impossible like that.tldr: Friend keeps keeling over uncontrolled and randomized since vaccination. After 6 months still no doctor knows why and we suffer extremely. Especially for her a normal life is no longer possible",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about your girlfriend's struggles. It's essential to approach this situation with compassion and understanding. I'll try to provide some guidance, but please note that I'm not a medical professional.\n\nGiven the complexity of your girlfriend's condition, it's crucial to find a doctor or a medical team that is willing to listen and work with you to identify the cause. Since she has already seen neurologists, family doctors, and had hospital visits, it might be beneficial to consider the following options:\n\n1. **Consult a cardiologist**: Although her heart was examined, it might be helpful to consult a cardiologist who specializes in autonomic nervous system disorders, such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). This condition can cause fainting, dizziness, and other symptoms similar to what your girlfriend is experiencing.\n2. **Seek a neurologist with expertise in autonomic disorders**: Some neurologists specialize in autonomic nervous system disorders, which could be related to her symptoms. You can search for neurologists with this expertise in your area.\n3. **Investigate the possibility of a vaccine-related adverse event**: Although you mentioned that you're not anti-vaccination, it's essential to consider the potential link between the vaccine and her symptoms. You can report her symptoms to the vaccine manufacturer or the national vaccine adverse event reporting system (e.g., VAERS in the US). This might help identify similar cases and potentially lead to further research or guidance.\n4. **Explore the idea of a tilt-table test**: A tilt-table test can help diagnose autonomic nervous system disorders, such as POTS or orthostatic intolerance. This test might provide valuable insights into your girlfriend's condition.\n5. **Consider a holistic approach**: Since your girlfriend reacts poorly to medication, a holistic approach might be beneficial. This could include working with a healthcare provider who specializes in integrative medicine, such as a naturopathic doctor or a functional medicine practitioner. They might help identify underlying factors contributing to her symptoms and develop a personalized treatment plan.\n6. **Look into online support groups and forums**: Connecting with others who may be experiencing similar symptoms can be helpful.

        "question": "25f 110ish lbs Everyday smoker Cannabis use Non drinker 200mg lamotrigine 2x daily 400mg zonsimide 2x daily Refractory epilepsy of unknown origin(possibly localized but won't know until I go in for my EMU)Hello so as you can see I have refractory epilepsy and my specialist and I are talking about me begining the steps towards a surgical approach as I'm still having breakthrough seizures. I have modified my doet and lifestyle in the hopes this would stop my seizures, but I'm still having breakthrough seizures about every other month or so. I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of other options I could try besides jumping to laser surgery or the VNS?Several people have mentioned chiropractic treatment and or acupuncture to me and it honestly sounds like a crock, but maybe they know something I don't???Please I'm open to suggestions",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're open to exploring other options before considering surgical approaches! Given your refractory epilepsy and medications, it's essential to discuss any new treatments or therapies with your specialist. That said, here are some alternative approaches that you may want to consider:\n\n1. **Ketogenic Diet**: You've already modified your diet, but you might want to look into a more structured ketogenic diet, which has been shown to be effective in reducing seizures in some people with epilepsy.\n2. **Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil**: As you mentioned you're a cannabis user, you might want to explore CBD oil specifically, which has been studied for its potential anti-seizure properties. However, consult your specialist before adding or changing any cannabis-related products.\n3. **Mind-Body Therapies**: Techniques like meditation, yoga, and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) may help reduce stress, which can contribute to seizures. Some studies suggest these therapies can be beneficial for people with epilepsy.\n4. **Chiropractic Care**: While it may seem unconventional, some people with epilepsy have reported benefits from chiropractic care, particularly in reducing stress and promoting relaxation.

        "question": "I've been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in two session, I stopped the first time due to cognitive side effects. However I started it again and I'm perplexed. I've always had intense headaches post ECT and during the first session I had intense deja vu experiences 2-10 times per day, this after about 1,5 months lowered to 3 times per week but up to 10 times a day. With this I developed difficulties placing people I've recently met, when I had gotten to know a face something in me just told me that I had known them since long. This time around, everyone I meet I recognise. Yesterday I was hours away from my hometown, and somehow I only met people I knew...but no one said hello...Anyone know information about this occurrence and whether it's a neurological concern or just a temporary side effect? My ECT-nurse had never heard of it before.Info: Male, 24 y/o, Caucasian, mucho depressed, no medications only ECT.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you reached out for help in understanding your experience. The phenomenon you're describing, where you feel like you recognize everyone you meet, is known as \"hyperthymestic syndrome\" or \"super recognition.\" It's a rare condition where a person has an exceptional ability to recognize faces, often accompanied by a feeling of familiarity or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nWhile hyperthymestic syndrome can be a fascinating phenomenon, in the context of ECT and your symptoms, it's essential to consider the potential underlying neurological mechanisms and possible concerns.\n\n**Possible explanations:**\n\n1. **Temporal lobe effects:** ECT can affect the temporal lobe, which is involved in memory and face recognition. Temporary disruptions in this area might lead to increased familiarity or recognition of faces.\n2. **Neuroplasticity and compensation:** As your brain adapts to the ECT treatment, it may be compensating for the cognitive side effects by relying more heavily on other brain regions, such as those involved in face recognition.\n3. **Deja vu and familiarity:** The high frequency of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences during your first ECT session could be related to the development of hyperthymestic syndrome. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can be a symptom of temporal lobe dysfunction, and the repeated experiences might have contributed to the changes in your face recognition abilities.\n4. **Psychological factors:** It's also possible that the psychological effects of ECT, such as changes in mood, anxiety, or stress levels, could be influencing your perception of familiarity or recognition.\n\n**Concerns and recommendations:**\n\nWhile hyperthymestic syndrome can be a benign condition, it's essential to monitor your symptoms and discuss them with your healthcare provider, including your ECT nurse and psychiatrist. They should be aware of your experiences to assess potential correlations with the ECT treatment.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. **Schedule a follow-up appointment:** Discuss your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.\n2. **Cognitive assessments:** Request cognitive evaluations to monitor any changes in your memory, attention, or executive functions, which could be related to the ECT treatment.\n3. **Mood monitoring:** Keep track of your mood, as changes in mood can influence your perception and cognition.\n4. **Face recognition and memory:** Perform simple exercises, like trying to recall new faces or remembering names, to assess your face recognition abilities and potential memory impairments.\n5. **Temporary or persistent condition:** It's essential to determine whether this is a temporary side effect or a more persistent condition. If it's a persistent condition, your healthcare provider may need to adjust your treatment plan or consider other therapies to help manage your symptoms.\n\n**Additional resources:**\n\n1. **Consult with a neurologist:** If your healthcare provider is unsure about the cause of your symptoms, consider consulting a neurologist for a more detailed evaluation.\n2. **Online resources:** Explore online forums, support groups, or websites focused on ECT, hyperthymestic syndrome, and cognitive psychology to learn more about your condition and connect with others who may have similar experiences.\n\nPlease keep in mind that every individual's experience with ECT and cognitive side effects is unique. It's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\nHow do you feel about discussing your symptoms with your healthcare provider, and have you noticed any other changes or side effects since starting ECT again?"

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll provide some general insights based on the symptoms you've described. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The symptoms you've experienced, such as numbness on one side of your face, tongue, and arm, followed by a loss of consciousness, could be indicative of several conditions, including but not limited to:\n\n1. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Mini-stroke:** These symptoms could suggest a TIA, often a warning sign of a future stroke. It's caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain.\n\n2. **Seizure:** Your friend's observation that it looked like you were having a seizure, combined with your loss of consciousness and other neurological symptoms, could indicate a seizure disorder. Seizures can be caused by various factors, including drug use.\n\n3. **Vasovagal Syncope:** This is a common cause of fainting spells and can be triggered by various factors, including stress, pain, or fear. It's characterized by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to reduced blood flow to the brain and a temporary loss of consciousness.\n\n4. **Drug-related Effects:** Your use of cocaine, vaping, and smoking weed could potentially contribute to or cause these symptoms. Cocaine, in particular, is known to have cardiovascular effects that could lead to similar symptoms, including heart arrhythmias and stroke.\n\n5. **Other Possible Causes:** There are many other potential causes for your symptoms, ranging from migraines to neurological disorders. It's essential to undergo a thorough medical evaluation to determine the cause.\n\nGiven that your blood sugar, EKG, and other initial tests were normal, it's possible that the cause of your symptoms might not be immediately apparent and could require further investigation.

        "question": "My daughter is 7F, in Canada, recently diagnosed ADHD-C but not on meds yet. All vaccines up to date. She is in therapy for ADHD & anxiety management at a local kid's multidisciplinary clinic (occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, counsellors, that sort of thing.)Sleep history: she had night terrors maybe 3-4 times total during her toddler years, nothing else of note.So, after years and years of no sleep issues, my daughter has had 4 very similar \"episodes\" within the past 4 weeks. Here's what they look like:-episodes start <2 hours after sleep onset and seem to have distinct \"phases\"-phase 1: she screams for me-phase 2: she gets into a crawling position on the bed and starts violently rocking forward/back and slapping or clawing at the mattress. She'll vocalize 1-2 words or sounds as if she's trying to communicate something to me, then make a tongue clicking sound, then try again, over and over. This lasts about 1-2 minutes. She seems to be aware of my presence but can't express herself. -phase 3: she starts running to her doorway as if she's looking for something, then returning to the bed to rock and click again, though she seems more \"in control\" of herself than in phase 2. This lasts longer, maybe 3-5 minutes. Again, she's aware of my presence and will even talk to me sometimes.-phase 4: she stops rocking and makes a very urgent, specific, and clearly spoken request. One time, for example, it was that she desperately needed a blue marker, which she used to write \"BACKE\" on a poster on her wall. Another time she needed to put her blanket in the corner in the shape of a pyramid.-phase 5: once the task is completed, she is very visibly relieved, and speaking normally. She lays down again and is very twitchy/shaky. It takes her about 5 minutes to stop twitching, and then she suddenly drops asleep.-she always remembers these episodes in perfect detail the next morning. She explains it as getting a \"weird\" feeling in the centre of her forehead, and then she sees something in the room that isn't right, like the door frame being too small or a clone of herself standing in the room.These episodes started suddenly a few days after we returned from a trip across the country to visit family. During that visit, she had a UTI and was on 10 days of cefixime, in case that's relevant. She was always accompanied by at least one parent at all times during the trip and we didn't notice any oddness in her behaviour.Daytime behaviour is mostly normal, though she is sometimes very tired when she wakes up, and that doesn't seem connected to these episodes.We've been treating this like some sort of sleepwalking manifestation of anxiety, but I'm starting to question myself. Does this description raise any flags that suggest we should be looking into other possibilities or getting her in to see a doctor?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide a neutral and informative response. The episodes you've described are indeed unusual and warrant further evaluation. While it's possible that these episodes could be related to anxiety or sleep disorders, there are some features that suggest exploring other potential causes.\n\n**Red flags:**\n\n1. **Sudden onset**: The sudden appearance of these episodes after years without sleep issues is concerning.\n2. **Complexity of episodes**: The distinct phases, violent rocking, and specific requests suggest a more complex phenomenon than typical sleepwalking or night terrors.\n3. **Tongue clicking and attempted communication**: This behavior is unusual and may indicate a seizure-like activity or other neurological phenomenon.\n4. **Memory of episodes**: Your daughter's ability to recall the episodes in detail the next morning is atypical for sleepwalking or night terrors, which are usually not remembered.\n5. **recent antibiotic treatment**: Although the UTI and antibiotic treatment may seem unrelated, it's essential to consider potential side effects or interactions.\n\n**Possible considerations:**\n\n1. **Nocturnal seizures**: The episodes' characteristics, such as the tongue clicking, violent rocking, and specific requests, could be indicative of nocturnal seizures. EEG testing might be necessary to rule out seizure activity.\n2. **Sleep stage and arousal disorders**: The episodes' timing (<2 hours after sleep onset) and features (e.g., rocking, vocalizations) might suggest a sleep stage or arousal disorder, such as a hyperarousal state or a sleep terror variant.\n3. **Neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric conditions**: The combination of ADHD-C, anxiety, and these episodes might indicate a more complex neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric condition, such as a mood disorder or a condition affecting emotional regulation.\n4. **Other medical conditions**: Although less likely, it's essential to consider other medical conditions that could be contributing to these episodes, such as migraines, sleep apnea, or restless leg syndrome.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult your daughter's pediatrician**: Schedule an appointment to discuss these episodes in detail and explore potential underlying causes.\n2. **Sleep specialist or neurologist referral**: Depending on the pediatrician's assessment, a referral to a sleep specialist or neurologist might be necessary to further investigate these episodes.\n3. **Keep a sleep diary**: Continue to document your daughter's sleep patterns, including the episodes, to help identify any potential triggers or patterns.\n4. **Monitor for additional symptoms**: Pay attention to any changes in your daughter's behavior, mood, or physical symptoms that might be related to these episodes.\n\nBy consulting with your daughter's healthcare team and providing detailed information, you can work together to determine the underlying cause of these episodes and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can try to provide some general information that might be helpful.\r\n\r\nIt's important to talk to a doctor or a pharmacist before making any changes to your medication regimen. While SSRIs like citalopram can be effective for anxiety, they may not work as well for depression, and in some cases, they can even worsen depressive symptoms, especially at higher doses. This is known as \"SSRI-induced depression\" or \"treatment-emergent depression.\"\r\n\r\nStopping your medication abruptly or without consulting a doctor is not recommended, as it can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which can be uncomfortable and even dangerous. These symptoms can include dizziness, headaches, nausea, insomnia, and flu-like symptoms.\r\n\r\nGiven your concerns about side effects and interactions, it's essential to discuss your options with a doctor. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks of different medications and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nConsidering your history with sertraline, fluoxetine, and mirtazapine, your doctor may suggest alternative antidepressants that are less likely to cause twitching or fatigue. Some options might include:\r\n\r\n1. **Bupropion (Wellbutrin)**: This medication is known for its energizing effects and is often used to treat depression, especially in people with fatigue. However, it's crucial to monitor for potential interactions with topiramate, as both medications can lower the seizure threshold.\r\n2. **Venlafaxine (Effexor)**: This is an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) that may be effective for depression and anxiety. While it can cause some fatigue, it's generally considered to be more energizing than SSRIs.\r\n3. **Duloxetine (Cymbalta)**: Another SNRI that may be an option, although it can cause fatigue in some people.\r\n\r\nRegarding amitriptyline, it's true that it's sometimes used for migraines, and combining it with topiramate might increase the risk of side effects. However, this combination is not uncommon, and your doctor can help you assess the potential benefits and risks.\r\n\r\nTo get the help you need, consider the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Contact your GP surgery**: Explain your situation, and ask if they can offer an emergency appointment or a telephone consultation.\r\n2. **Reach out to a crisis helpline**: Organizations like the Samaritans (116 123) or the NHS 111 service can provide immediate support and guidance.\r\n3. **Visit an urgent care center or A&E**: If you're experiencing severe symptoms or suicidal thoughts, don't hesitate to seek help at an urgent care center or accident and emergency department.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's essential to work with a healthcare professional to find the right treatment plan for your depression and anxiety. They can help you navigate the complex world of medications and ensure your safety while exploring alternative options."

We learned of a perinatal stroke he had between 28-32 weeks. He was born at 33 weeks, 3 days (twin A). He has left hemiplegia, is legally blind, ambulatory, talks, etc.On 4/30/19, he had a blow out focal seizure that generalized. He was stabilized by EMS with Versed and is now on a daily generic Keppra dose that is controlling seizure activity and is doing great. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so proud of him. He\u2019s such an incredible human being. The thing is, I can\u2019t seem to get over this looming threat of another generalized seizure. I have rescue meds, I\u2019m with he and his his twin sister all the time, but I\u2019ve lost all sense of calm since this event. I can\u2019t sleep through the night without checking on him repeatedly (he\u2019s actually sleeping in our room since it happened). I have motion and sound activated cameras all over my home, as he isn\u2019t a great fit for most seizure detecting devices. I am so worried I\u2019m ruining his life by being so caught up in this FEAR of another big seizure. I am scared all the time. I want him to be happy. I don\u2019t want him to stop speaking to me when he turns 18 because I am such an annoying, overbearing mom. I want him to have privacy. With COVID, I\u2019ve gotten even more protective. We really don\u2019t go anywhere anymore. We\u2019ve ceased all in person therapies and remotely attend school, as I\u2019m so scared of a fever triggering a seizure. We were hiking a lot this summer, but all the trails in my area are very busy, and we just couldn\u2019t continue risking it. Any ped neuros/epileptologists out here, please give me some feedback. What is the likelihood of him having a breakthrough seizure out of nowhere? How can I get past this and let him just be a kid? If the seizure occurred because of his brain injury from the stroke, will it always remain controlled with the Keppra, or can that change, too? FWIW, his twin sister is also incredible and hilarious, kind and wondrous.",

        "answer": "I'll provide you with some general information and insights, but please note that I'm not a substitute for a pediatric neurologist or epileptologist. It's essential to consult with your son's healthcare team for personalized advice.\n\n**Likelihood of breakthrough seizures:**\nThe likelihood of your son experiencing another breakthrough seizure is difficult to predict, as it depends on various factors, such as the underlying cause of his epilepsy, the effectiveness of his medication, and individual factors like his brain's susceptibility to seizures. However, it's reassuring that he's been seizure-free since starting Keppra, which suggests that the medication is effective in controlling his seizures.\n\n**Factors influencing seizure control:**\nThe fact that your son's seizure was triggered by a perinatal stroke and subsequent brain injury may affect the likelihood of future seizures. However, with proper medication and management, many children with epilepsy can lead active and relatively normal lives.\n\n**Keppra efficacy and potential changes:**\nKeppra (levetiracetam) is a commonly used medication for controlling seizures, and it's generally well-tolerated. However, as with any medication, there's a possibility that its effectiveness may change over time. This could be due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Medication tolerance:** Your son's brain may adapt to the medication, reducing its effectiveness.\n2. **Hormonal changes:** As your son grows and develops, hormonal changes may affect his seizure threshold.\n3. **Brain maturation:** The brain continues to mature and develop, which may influence seizure activity.\n\nRegular monitoring and follow-up with your son's healthcare team will help identify any potential changes in his seizure control.\n\n**Managing fear and anxiety:**\nIt's understandable that you're experiencing fear and anxiety about your son's condition. To help you cope, consider the following:\n\n1. **Open communication with your son's healthcare team:** Share your concerns and ask for guidance on managing your anxiety.\n2. **Support groups:** Join online or in-person support groups for parents of children with epilepsy to connect with others who face similar challenges.\n3. **Counseling:** Individual or family therapy can help you develop coping strategies and address any underlying anxiety or depression.\n4. **Seizure action plan:** Develop a plan with your son's healthcare team, outlining what to do in case of a seizure, which can help you feel more prepared and in control.\n5. **Gradual exposure:** Gradually increase your son's independence and participation in activities, while still maintaining a safe and supportive environment.\n\n**Encouraging independence and normalcy:**\nTo promote your son's independence and normalcy, consider the following:\n\n1. **Gradually increase independence:** Encourage your son to take on more responsibility for his daily activities, such as dressing, feeding, or using the bathroom.\n2. **Encourage socialization:** Support your son's participation in social activities, such as playdates, sports, or extracurricular activities, while taking necessary safety precautions.\n3. **Foster a sense of control:** Involve your son in decision-making processes, such as choosing activities or setting goals, to help him feel more in control of his life.\n4. **Focus on strengths:** Emphasize your son's strengths, abilities, and interests to help build his confidence and self-esteem.\n\n**COVID-19 considerations:**\nWhile it's essential to take precautions during the pandemic, it's also important to balance these measures with your son's need for socialization, education, and physical activity. Discuss your concerns with your son's healthcare team to determine the best approach for your family.\n\nRemember, as a parent, it's natural to feel anxious and protective of your child. However, by working with your son's healthcare team, seeking support, and gradually increasing his independence, you can help him lead a happy, fulfilling life while managing your own anxiety and fears."

        "question": "I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it, which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.I\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing. That is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear, move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.Throughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.I\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.I know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated. EDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

        "answer": "I'm glad you're seeking medical attention again, and I'll do my best to provide some insights and suggestions. Please note that I'm not a doctor, but rather a knowledgeable assistant trying to help.\n\nYour symptoms are indeed complex and have been affecting your life significantly. I'll try to break down some possible causes and connections:\n\n1. **Temporary \"blanking out\" and loss of focus**: This could be related to transient changes in blood flow or cerebral perfusion. The fact that you experience relief after manipulating your TMJ joint suggests a possible connection between your jaw, blood flow, and brain function.\n2. **TMJ joint manipulation and relief**: The temporary relief you experience after manipulating your TMJ joint could be related to the release of tension in the surrounding muscles, improved blood flow, or even a temporary change in the alignment of the joint itself. The warm, liquidy sensation and feeling of blood flow in the joint are interesting observations.\n3. **Possible subdued artery or vascular issue**: It's possible that an artery or blood vessel near your TMJ joint is being compressed or affected, leading to altered blood flow to your brain. This could be related to a condition like Eagle syndrome (stylohyoid ligament calcification) or a vascular anomaly.\n4. **Normal imaging results**: The fact that your imaging results (MRI, MRA, and cervical spine MRI) are normal doesn't necessarily rule out a vascular or muscular issue. Some conditions may not be visible on standard imaging tests.\n5. **Other possible causes**: Considering your symptoms and the fact that you've tried various treatments without success, it's essential to explore other potential causes, such as:\n\t* Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD)\n\t* Cervicogenic headache or cervical spine issues\n\t* Migraines or other headache disorders\n\t* Autonomic nervous system dysfunction\n\t* Neurovascular disorders (e.g., vasculitis, vascular malformations)\n\t* Other medical conditions (e.g., anemia, hypothyroidism, sleep disorders)\n\nWhen you meet with your doctor, be sure to discuss the following:\n\n1. **Detailed symptom description**: Share your symptoms, including the temporary \"blanking out,\" loss of focus, and any other related sensations.\n2. **TMJ joint manipulation and relief**: Explain the specific technique you use to manipulate your TMJ joint and the resulting relief.\n3. **Medical history**: Review your medical history, including any previous treatments, medications, and test results.\n4. **Family history**: Share any relevant family medical history, including conditions that may be related to your symptoms.\n5. **Lifestyle factors**: Discuss your diet, sleep habits, exercise routine, and any other factors that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nSome potential questions to ask your doctor:\n\n1. Could my symptoms be related to a vascular issue, such as a subdued artery or vascular anomaly?\n2. Are there any additional imaging tests or diagnostic procedures that could help identify the underlying cause of my symptoms?\n3. Would a referral to a specialist, such as a neurologist, vascular specialist, or orofacial pain specialist, be beneficial?\n4. Are there any alternative treatments or therapies that could help alleviate my symptoms, such as physical therapy, cognitive training, or relaxation techniques?\n5. How can I work with you to develop a comprehensive treatment plan to address my symptoms and improve my overall quality of life?\n\nRemember to be open and honest with your doctor, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if needed. It's essential to work together to find the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan."

        "question": "Female, 40, has a history of seizures but not since 2011, after surgery,  Can you feel a seizure in your head? Google says it goes from your head to other parts of your body, but could someone feel it happen inside their head? Why don't all seizures show up on eeg? Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one? If there is an article that explains all this, I would love to read it. Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll address your questions and provide some detailed explanations.\n\n**Can you feel a seizure in your head?**\n\nYes, it's possible for someone to feel a seizure starting in their head or be aware of unusual sensations before a seizure occurs. This is often referred to as an \"aura.\" An aura is a subjective experience that can manifest as a strange feeling, taste, smell, or sensation in the head, which can serve as a warning sign that a seizure is about to happen. Auras can be caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can irritate the surrounding brain tissue and trigger a range of sensations.\n\nSome people may experience an aura as a:\n\n* Strange or unpleasant smell\n* Metallic taste\n* Tingling or numbness in the head or face\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n* Confusion or disorientation\n* Visual disturbances, such as flashing lights or zigzag patterns\n\n**Why don't all seizures show up on EEG?**\n\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain. While an EEG can detect abnormal brain activity, it's not always possible to capture a seizure on the EEG. There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. **Seizure location**: If the seizure occurs in a deep or small area of the brain, the electrical activity might not be strong enough to be detected by the EEG electrodes on the scalp.\n2. **Seizure type**: Some types of seizures, such as simple partial seizures or some forms of absence seizures, may not produce significant changes in brain activity that can be detected by an EEG.\n3. **Interictal activity**: Between seizures, the brain may not show any abnormal activity, making it difficult to diagnose epilepsy or predict seizures.\n4. **Electrode placement**: The EEG electrodes may not be placed in the optimal location to detect the seizure activity.\n5. **Seizure duration**: If the seizure is very brief, it may not be captured on the EEG.\n\n**Is it possible to not notice or feel having a seizure but suddenly have the feeling like you had one?**\n\nYes, it's possible to have a seizure without being aware of it or feeling any symptoms during the seizure itself. This is often referred to as a \"subclinical seizure\" or \"asymptomatic seizure.\" Subclinical seizures can occur without any noticeable symptoms, such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, or changes in behavior.\n\nIn some cases, people may experience a feeling of exhaustion, confusion, or disorientation after a seizure, even if they didn't notice the seizure itself. This can be due to the post-ictal phase, which is the period after a seizure when the brain is recovering from the abnormal electrical activity.\n\n**Articles and resources**\n\nFor more information, you can check out the following articles and resources:\n\n1. **Epilepsy Foundation**: \"What is an aura?\" and \"Why don't all seizures show up on an EEG?\"\n2. **American Epilepsy Society**: \"Seizures and EEG\"\n3. **National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke**: \"Epilepsy: Hope Through Research\"\n4. **The Lancet Neurology**: \"Subclinical seizures in epilepsy\" (article, may require subscription)\n\nRegarding your personal history, it's great to hear that you haven't had any seizures since 2011, after surgery! If you have any concerns or questions about your specific situation, I recommend discussing them with your healthcare provider or a neurologist. They can provide personalized guidance and help you better understand your condition.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any further questions or would like more specific resources, feel free to ask."

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general insights and considerations based on the information you've shared. Please keep in mind that it's essential to consult with your healthcare professionals, especially your neurologist and rheumatologist, for personalized advice.\n\n**GBS and Vaccine Reactions**\n\nYou've had a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder that can be triggered by infections or, in some cases, vaccinations. Your concern about a potential neurological reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine is understandable, given your past experience with the flu shot. However, it's essential to note that:\n\n1. The COVID-19 vaccines have undergone extensive testing, and the risk of vaccine-related GBS is extremely low.\n2. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19, particularly for someone with autoimmune conditions, likely outweigh the risks.\n3. Your neurologist, who is familiar with your medical history, recommends getting vaccinated, which suggests they believe the benefits outweigh the risks for you.\n\n**Autoimmune Conditions and COVID-19**\n\nAs someone with diagnosed and undiagnosed autoimmune conditions, you may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine can help protect you against severe illness, hospitalization, and long-term complications.\n\n**Episcleritis and Joint Pain**\n\nYour recent symptoms, such as episcleritis and joint pain, could be related to your undiagnosed autoimmune condition. It's essential to discuss these symptoms with your rheumatologist and explore possible connections to your overall health and vaccination plans.\n\n**Vaccination Considerations**\n\nWhen discussing vaccination with your rheumatologist, consider the following:\n\n1. **Risk-benefit analysis**: Weigh the potential risks of vaccination against the benefits of protection against severe COVID-19.\n2. **Vaccine type**: There are multiple COVID-19 vaccines available, and some may be considered safer for individuals with autoimmune conditions. Your healthcare team can help determine which vaccine is most suitable for you.\n3. **Precautions and monitoring**: If you decide to get vaccinated, your healthcare team can take precautions, such as monitoring you for any adverse reactions, to minimize risks.\n4. **Alternative vaccination strategies**: In some cases, a slower vaccination schedule or a different vaccine formulation might be considered to reduce potential side effects.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Rheumatologist**\n\nWhen speaking with your rheumatologist, consider asking:\n\n1. What are the potential risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination for someone with my medical history?\n2. How might my autoimmune conditions affect my response to the vaccine?\n3. Are there any specific precautions or monitoring that can be taken to minimize potential side effects?\n4. Which COVID-19 vaccine would be most suitable for me, and why?\n5. How will we manage my undiagnosed autoimmune condition in the context of vaccination?\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nAfter discussing your concerns with your rheumatologist, you may want to:\n\n1. **Consult with your neurologist** again to ensure you're on the same page regarding vaccination recommendations.\n2. **Review your medication list** to ensure that any potential interactions between your medications and the vaccine are considered.\n3. **Develop a plan** for monitoring and managing potential side effects, if you decide to get vaccinated.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize open and honest communication with your healthcare team to make informed decisions about your health. Good luck with your discussions, and I hope you find the insights and support you need to make the best decision for your situation."

        "question": "Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?Bf is currently experiencing \u201cpanic attacks\u201d that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.Background: He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxios and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use. Early 2021 - Symptoms begin: He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.  June 2021 - Symptoms worsen: He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room: In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (gabapentin pregabalin~~)~~ that eventually increased to 150mg. August 2021 - Regular emergency room: Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak). MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist. Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? : He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\". My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm). Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!) available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up. Where I'm stuck: We're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that your boyfriend is going through this, and that you're feeling frustrated and scared. As a research scientist in mental health, your instincts are valuable, and it's essential to advocate for your boyfriend's needs.\n\nGiven the complexity of his symptoms, it's understandable that you're concerned about the diagnosis of panic attacks and the lack of consideration for potential neurological underlying conditions. The combination of symptoms, such as loss of balance, slurred speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades, fainting, and vomiting, suggests that there may be more to his condition than anxiety alone.\n\nHere are some potential concerns and suggestions:\n\n1. **Neurological symptoms**: The presence of neurological symptoms, such as loss of balance, slurred speech, and rapid eye saccades, warrants a thorough neurological evaluation. It's possible that there's an underlying condition, such as a seizure disorder, migraines, or even a condition like multiple sclerosis, that needs to be ruled out.\n2. **Electroencephalogram (EEG) limitations**: Although the EEG was negative for seizures, it's essential to note that a single EEG may not capture all seizure activity. Repeated EEGs or other tests, like a long-term EEG or video-EEG monitoring, might be necessary to rule out seizure disorders.\n3. **Other potential causes**: Other conditions, such as vestibular disorders (e.g., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), orthostatic intolerance, or autonomic nervous system dysfunction, could be contributing to his symptoms.\n4. **Medication management**: The reduction of Lyrica from 150mg to 100mg seems counterintuitive, given the severity of his symptoms. It's unclear why the psychiatrist decided to decrease the dose, and it may be worth discussing this decision with the doctor.\n5. **Lack of coordination and communication**: The fact that the psychiatrist is not considering a neurologist referral, and the ER is not taking his symptoms seriously, is concerning. It's essential to have a coordinated care approach, with a team of healthcare professionals working together to address his complex needs.\n\nGiven the Canadian healthcare system and the challenges you're facing, here are some potential next steps:\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion**: Try to find another psychiatrist or a neurologist who can provide a fresh perspective on your boyfriend's condition. You can ask for referrals from friends, family, or online support groups.\n2. **Contact the Quebec Health Ministry**: Reach out to the Quebec Health Ministry or the R\u00e9gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (RAMQ) to report your concerns about the lack of coordination and communication between healthcare providers.\n3. **Look into private healthcare options**: If possible, consider seeking private healthcare services, such as a private neurologist or a comprehensive medical clinic, that may offer more timely and specialized care.\n4. **Online resources**: Utilize online resources, such as the Canadian Neurological Sciences Federation or the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, to gather information and connect with others who may be experiencing similar symptoms.\n5. **Advocate for your boyfriend**: Continue to advocate for your boyfriend's needs, and don't hesitate to reach out to his healthcare providers to express your concerns and ask questions.\n\nRemember, as a research scientist in mental health, your expertise and advocacy can help ensure that your boyfriend receives the comprehensive care he needs.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. If your boyfriend is experiencing severe symptoms, such as suicidal thoughts or severe physical symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention."

        "question": "My son- 2.5 year old M, 3 feet tall, 35 lbs, takes 1.5ml Keppra 2x/day- diagnosed with generalized epilepsy in December and taking keppra since then- had mri under sedation in Feb and found a significant Chiari malformation (normal cerebellar tonsils are 3-5 mm, his are 15)- they say the chiari and epilepsy are not related though it seems like quite a coincidence to me. Thoughts??",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information and insights. It's essential to consult with a neurologist or a specialist for personalized advice and guidance.\n\n**Generalized epilepsy and Keppra treatment:**\nIt's great that your son has been diagnosed and started on Keppra, a common medication for epilepsy. The dosage seems to be relatively standard for a child of his age and weight. You may want to ask his neurologist about the possibility of adjusting the dosage or exploring other medications if his seizures persist or change in frequency/intensity.\n\n**Chiari malformation:**\nA Chiari malformation is a structural abnormality in the brain, where the cerebellar tonsils protrude into the spinal canal. The severity of the condition varies, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. The fact that your son's cerebellar tonsils are 15 mm below the normal range (3-5 mm) indicates a significant malformation.\n\n**Relationship between Chiari malformation and epilepsy:**\nWhile the medical team may have stated that the Chiari malformation and epilepsy are unrelated, it's not uncommon for patients with Chiari malformation to experience seizures. Some studies suggest that the malformation can cause abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which may contribute to seizure development. However, the exact relationship between the two conditions is not yet fully understood and is still being researched.\n\n**Coincidence or connection?**\nYou're right to question the coincidence of both conditions being present in your son. While it's possible that they are unrelated, it's essential to consider the potential connection. Some possible explanations for the co-occurrence of Chiari malformation and epilepsy include:\n\n1. **Shared underlying genetic or developmental factors:** Both conditions may be related to genetic or environmental factors that affect brain development.\n2. **Brain structure and function abnormalities:** The Chiari malformation could be contributing to abnormal brain activity, which may increase the risk of seizures.\n3. **Symptomatic epilepsy:** The Chiari malformation could be causing seizures as a symptom of the underlying structural abnormality.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion:** Consult with a neurosurgeon or a specialist in pediatric neurology to discuss the potential relationship between the Chiari malformation and epilepsy.\n2. **Monitor and adjust treatment:** Continue to work with your son's neurologist to monitor his seizures and adjust his medication as needed.\n3. **Consider further testing:** You may want to ask about additional testing, such as EEGs or sleep studies, to better understand your son's seizure activity and potential connections to the Chiari malformation.\n4. **Follow up with the neurosurgeon:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments with the neurosurgeon to monitor the Chiari malformation and discuss potential surgical options if necessary.\n\nRemember, every child is unique, and it's essential to work closely with medical professionals to determine the best course of treatment for your son's specific conditions."

        "question": "This is going to be a long post, I also copy pasted it from my previous post on a different forum which I used because I thought this forum was taken down. Im not sure if that's ok.I (m24) have had episodes of sudden double vision which lasts approximately 40 minutes each time for 5 years. I am responsive and coherent during episodes. They are usually a few grouped together within 2 weeks of each other and no more than 10 'episodes' a year.This is something I have seen many doctors, including neurologists, for ever since it began and have never gotten solid answers.Things ruled out by medical professionals and lab tests are: epilepsy  migraines   vertigo    brain masses  scar tissue in brain  eye diseases  blood sugar problems  blood pressure   medication levels Through my own observations by recording and testing things during episodes I have also found that it has no correlation with dehydration  eye appearance (pupil size, placement and no involuntary eye movement)  blood sugar  temperatures  foods or caffeine time of day   medications  body position (standing, sitting, laying down, walking)    eye fatigue smoking (happened both before I started smoking and after) finally realized I will start feeling slightly disoriented about 5-10 minutes before it starts. When the double vision starts, moving around promotes more dizziness but only because my eyes can't focus. If I am sitting down or keeping my head level there will still be feeling of mild disorientation and double vision but no dizziness. These episodes last almost exactly 40 minutes every time (I set a stopwatch when they start.) with the longest edging closer to an hour.  I started having peripheral neuropathy involving both arms and both legs early this year but after blood tests we found out I had severe vitamin D deficiency. After high doses of Vitamin D this completely went away and I was hoping the double vision would also go away (because most of the episodes happen between september and april, lower light months). But unfortunately it's still happening.Again I am left anxious and concerned because the episodes just came back. A notable episode happened recently when the double vision was significantly worse than ever before and went away when I used only one eye (it used to happen no matter which eye I looked through or if I used both.). It made the double vision go from a noticeable but slight 'distance' between the two versions I see, to double vision that showed stuff separate up to 3 inches apart. I don't drive so it's no danger to myself or others but when I'm walking it makes it hard to make out things like stoplights or to be able to look side to side to check for cars without feeling like I will fall. Just knowing it might start at any moment is so terrible.I have looked this up and talked to doctors about it so much over the past 5 years and I just want to know if there are any other reasons these might be happening or advice about what to do.I forgot to mention I did have a few minor concussions as a kid. 3 notable ones were when i broke my nose falling directly on my face with some confusion, the back of my head going through drywall and a hit against the back of my head where i may have blacked out for a second. No puking or memory loss after any and no need to see a doctor. and A benzo overdose a year before first episode with no short memory for 3 days (i was medically cleared afterwards and it caused no other issues) Thats why they were looking for possible scar tissue in my brain.The peripheral neuropathy mentioned came back. My vitamin D levels came back normal and my doctor checked my parathyroid hormone levels because of it and those also came back normal. She's suggesting neuro again but I probably won't schedule unless something gets worse or something new happens bc specialty appointments are expensive.",

        "answer": "I'm glad you found this forum and decided to share your experience. I'll do my best to provide a helpful response.\n\nFirstly, please don't worry about copying and pasting from your previous post. It's completely fine, and it's great that you've kept a detailed record of your experiences.\n\nNow, let's dive into your situation. It's clear that you've been experiencing these episodes of double vision for 5 years, and despite seeing many doctors and undergoing various tests, you haven't received a clear diagnosis or explanation.\n\nThe fact that you've ruled out several potential causes, such as epilepsy, migraines, vertigo, brain masses, and eye diseases, is helpful in narrowing down the possibilities. Your self-observations and testing have also provided valuable insights, such as the lack of correlation with dehydration, eye appearance, blood sugar, temperatures, foods, caffeine, time of day, medications, body position, and smoking.\n\nThe recent episode with significantly worse double vision that improved when using one eye is particularly interesting. This could suggest that there's an issue with binocular vision or the way your brain is processing visual information.\n\nGiven your history of minor concussions and a benzo overdose, it's possible that there may be some underlying neurological factors contributing to these episodes. The fact that you've had peripheral neuropathy, which was initially attributed to a vitamin D deficiency, but has now returned despite normal vitamin D levels, adds another layer of complexity to your case.\n\nBefore considering another neurology appointment, you may want to explore a few more aspects:\n\n1. **Keep a detailed journal**: Continue to record your episodes, including any potential triggers, symptoms, and factors that seem to exacerbate or alleviate the double vision.\n2. **Investigate other potential causes**: You may want to discuss the following with your doctor:\n\t* Multiple sclerosis (MS): Although you've had some tests, MS can be difficult to diagnose, and your symptoms could be related to this condition.\n\t* Other neurological conditions: Such as Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, or cranial nerve disorders.\n\t* Vestibular system issues: As you've experienced dizziness and disorientation, it's possible that there's an issue with your vestibular system.\n3. **Consider a second opinion**: If you're not satisfied with the care you've received so far, you may want to seek a second opinion from a neurologist or a specialist in a related field (e.g., neuro-ophthalmology).\n4. **Explore alternative explanations**: Some potential causes that may not have been fully explored include:\n\t* Sleep disorders: Such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, which can cause daytime symptoms.\n\t* Anxiety or stress: Although you mentioned anxiety, it's possible that underlying stress or anxiety could be contributing to your symptoms.\n5. **Prepare for your next appointment**: If you do decide to schedule another neurology appointment, make sure to bring all your records, including your journal, test results, and any relevant medical history.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be patient and persistent when dealing with a complex medical condition. It may take time and multiple evaluations to uncover the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nHow do you feel about exploring these options, and is there anything specific that's been concerning you or any questions you have about your situation?"

        "answer": "I'll break down the findings and provide an interpretation. However, please keep in mind that only a doctor, specifically a radiologist or a hepatologist, can provide a definitive diagnosis and recommendations tailored to your individual situation.\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n\n* Multiple (at least 7) liver lesions in both lobes, with the largest measuring 1.8 cm in segment 6 of the right lobe\n* Lesions are:\n\t+ Arterially enhancing (meaning they receive blood supply from arteries)\n\t+ Hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI images (suggesting they have a high water content)\n\t+ Without internal fat\n* No definite washout (meaning the contrast agent doesn't rapidly disappear from the lesions)\n* Lesions appear to enhance less than background vessels on delayed phases (suggesting they may not be hemangiomas)\n\n**Possible interpretations:**\n\n1. **Hepatic adenoma**: The radiologist suggests that the imaging features are consistent with adenoma, which is a type of benign liver tumor. Adenomas are usually solitary, but multiple adenomas can occur. They are more common in women, especially those with a history of oral contraceptive use (like Yaz).\n2. **Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)**: This is another type of benign liver tumor that can appear similar to adenoma on imaging. FNH is also more common in women and can be multiple.\n3. **Other possibilities**: Although not mentioned in the report, other potential causes of liver lesions include inflammatory pseudotumors, regenerative nodules, or even metastatic disease (although the latter is less likely given your medical history).\n\n**Should you worry?**\n\nWhile the findings are concerning, it's essential to note that both adenoma and FNH are typically benign conditions. However, there are some potential risks associated with these lesions:\n\n* Adenomas can rarely rupture and cause bleeding, especially if they are large or if you have a history of trauma.\n* FNH is usually asymptomatic, but large lesions can cause pain or discomfort.\n\nGiven your complex medical history, including epilepsy, migraines, and chronic pancreatitis, it's essential to discuss these findings with your doctor. They will likely recommend:\n\n1. **Follow-up imaging**: Regular MRI or CT scans to monitor the size and behavior of the lesions.\n2. **Consideration of biopsy**: If the lesions are concerning or growing, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n3. **Review of medications**: Your doctor may reassess your medications, including Yaz, to determine if they could be contributing to the development of these lesions.\n\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician or a specialist (e.g., gastroenterologist or hepatologist) to discuss these findings and determine the best course of action."

        "question": "Hello. This is about my wife who is 19F. Non smoker. Non vaper. No medical issues. No history of epilepsy in her family. I would like to highlight main parts of this inquiry. Not going into too much detail unless required by someone.My wife (19) first time pregnant had an emergency C section at 36 weeks due to breech. Baby passed away. She was fine. Had some headaches and after 6 days at home she felt blurry vision and after about 20 mins got her first seizure ever. Got 2nd one in the ambulance and after reaching hospital had 3 more.In the hospital they performed another spinal tap for her CSF (Lumbar puncture) and MRI. All tests etc were good. MRI suggested some activity in the front part of her brain. But doctors couldn't pinpoint anything. They concluded that it must have happened due to her previous spinal anesthesia for c section which is rare but not impossible.She was discharged 12 days later with Phenytoin medicine for epilepsy. 300mg per day (3 tablets all together) for 3 months. It has been a month and half (or less) and she had no seizure but some strange observations I had about her: Very sensitive to light especially when very sleepy or waking up.She had blurry vision again but partially and in one eye. One day she had in both eyes.e become a deep sleeper and it becomes really hard to wake her up. She would sleep for about 7 to 9 hours and wake up only if we woke her up. When I discussed these observations with the doctor he told me to decrease dosage to 200mg per day. Almost 2 weeks now since lowering her dosage. She has developed this strange itching all over her body that prevents her from sleeping since 3 to 5 days. She also felt her hand vibrate or shake for 2 to 3 secs while sleeping. oday she said that she felt her whole right side of the body vibrate a little and after that her right arm. She seems normal for the most part. No slurred speech, just that she forgot some of the things before seizures and also her journey from home to hospital. So is she at risk of getting seizures again? I am too damn afraid. Even when she itches the whole bed vibrates the same way it did when she had her seizure and this thing keeps me on my toes at all times. I also read that the itching can be due to some neurological issues and I think it might be Multiple sclerosis??",

        "answer": "I can sense your concern and fear for your wife's health. I'll try to provide a neutral and informative response.\n\n**Summary of the situation:**\n\n* Your 19-year-old wife had an emergency C-section at 36 weeks, and unfortunately, the baby passed away.\n* She experienced her first seizure 6 days after discharge, followed by multiple seizures, and was diagnosed with epilepsy.\n* She was prescribed Phenytoin (300mg/day) for 3 months.\n* After 1.5 months, you noticed some strange observations: sensitivity to light, blurry vision, deep sleep, and difficulty waking her up.\n* The doctor reduced her dosage to 200mg/day, and since then, she has developed itching all over her body, preventing her from sleeping, and experienced vibrating sensations in her hand and right side of her body.\n\n**Risks of seizures:**\n\n* Given that she has already experienced seizures, there is a possibility of recurrence, especially since she has been diagnosed with epilepsy.\n* However, the fact that she has been seizure-free for over a month and a half is a positive sign.\n* The reduction in dosage might have contributed to the new symptoms she's experiencing, but it's also possible that her body is adjusting to the new dosage.\n\n**New symptoms:**\n\n* The itching could be a side effect of the medication or an unrelated issue.\n* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a possibility, but it's essential to note that MS is a chronic condition that typically presents with a range of symptoms, including vision problems, muscle weakness, and balance issues.

        "question": "Every so often I get these really weird sensations that feel somewhat neurological that I haven't a clue what they are since they seem so different from anything else I know of. I've been getting them occasionally for over a year now. 25F. I just had one now and it leaves me in such a weird state of mind afterwards.I feel somewhat floaty and dizzy currently, so please forgive me if this isn't constructed well.It begins as a tingling sensation? Like a shiver. That flushes through me. And I feel some kind of emotion that I can't describe, like dread or deja vu or some kind of combination of the two. I become hyperaware of my sorroundings, like reality has become more real? It's very abstract and weird, I know. I usually forget the specifics of these sensations; but I've written them down previously while experiencing them so I can repeat these now. Afterwards, accompanied by a light headache that goes away fairly quickly.(Very, very rarely I get migraines with a visual aura, but this experience is completely different.)I'm really dizzy/floaty this time around and I'm not sure why. It has been a while since it happened; I thought it had stopped happening. It passes after some time and doesn't seem to negatively affect me, though it's very difficult to maintain a conversation or writing while it's happening. I don't think I've ever been this dizzy thoughNo other diagnoses, no medication, or anything else. I don't know how long the shivering phase lasts, but I think its under a minute.

        "answer": "I'm here to help you explore these unusual sensations. Given your description, I'll try to provide some possible explanations and insights. Please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's always best to consult a doctor or a neurologist for a thorough evaluation.\n\nYour symptoms seem to resemble a mix of neurological and psychological experiences. Here are a few potential possibilities:\n\n1. **Depersonalization or derealization episodes**: These conditions involve feeling disconnected from oneself or the environment, which might fit with your description of feeling \"hyperaware\" and like reality has become more real. Depersonalization can also cause feelings of dread, anxiety, or unease.\n2. **Sensory-processing issues**: The tingling sensation, shivering, and dizziness might be related to sensory processing difficulties. This could be due to an imbalance in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin or dopamine, which regulate sensory information.\n3. **Anxiety or stress response**: The emotional state you described, which includes dread and a sense of unease, could be a manifestation of anxiety or a stress response. This might be triggered by internal or external factors, such as stress, fatigue, or specific situations.\n4. **Migraine-like phenomena**: Although you mentioned that this experience is different from your migraines with visual aura, some people can experience migraine-like symptoms without the typical headache or visual disturbances. These phenomena can include sensory sensitivities, dizziness, and feelings of unease.\n5. **Transient neurological phenomena**: There are various temporary and benign neurological events that can cause unusual sensations, such as **benign paroxysmal positional vertigo** (BPPV), **vagus nerve stimulation**, or **sensory cortex stimulation**.\n\nGiven your history of migraines with visual aura, it's possible that these episodes might be related to a similar underlying neurological mechanism. However, the differences between these episodes and your migraines suggest that they might be distinct phenomena.\n\nTo better understand these sensations, consider the following:\n\n* **Keep a symptom journal**: Document the frequency, duration, and any potential triggers for these episodes. This can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for a medical professional.\n* **Seek medical evaluation**: Schedule an appointment with a primary care physician or a neurologist to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to these episodes.\n* **Consider lifestyle factors**: Look into stress management techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or cognitive-behavioral therapy, to help cope with potential anxiety or stress triggers.\n* **Monitor your sleep and fatigue**: Ensure you're getting sufficient rest and practicing good sleep hygiene, as fatigue can exacerbate neurological symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with a medical professional to rule out any underlying conditions and develop a plan to manage these episodes. They can help you determine the best course of action and provide guidance on how to cope with these unusual sensations.\n\nHow do you feel about seeking medical attention to explore these sensations further?

        "question": "I\u2019m 22F. So in 2017 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a full-tonic (like a stereotypical?) seizure having had myoclonic seizures constantly for like 2 years before then. No one took me seriously until the major one. During the diagnosis and since, I was constantly asked to describe what I NOW know are myoclonic seizures, but no one ever said they were. I was on Lamotrigine (around 100mg morning and night) until 2020, then was on Keppra (500mg morning and night). In 2021 I was told that since i hadn\u2019t had a seizure in over 3 years I could stop medication (which wasn\u2019t actually true- I hadn\u2019t had a full on seizure in over 3 years but I still had myoclonic ones when having sleeping problems but no neurologist seemed to understand that they were seizures?). The ECG came back clear but I was too nervous to stop meds but in 2022 I was recommended to stop meds again and the ECG was clear again too, so I did. From May 2022 I was absolutely fine with zero issues at all. Then one night in September, I was only able to sleep 2 hours and had dozens of myoclonic seizures until I had a full on seizure. Completely out of the blue. I was then put on 250mg Keppra morning and night but the new neurologist prescribed Lamotrigine\u2026but only 25mg every morning. I was fine on 500mg Keppra/day but then ran out in October and hadn\u2019t been told how to make the switch, so I just replaced the meds. In the days right after, I\u2019d have a small myoclonic seizure while trying to fall asleep but I thought I was just trying to adjust. A few days later though, I woke up (after minimum 6 hours of sleep) and had dozens of myoclonic seizures only seconds apart and I spent hours trying to fight off a major seizure. After a few hours break we went to A&E because I was begging for meds I wasn\u2019t prescribed. They just said to take 25mg Lamotrigine at night so I immediately did. When I went to bed the constant myoclonic seizures resumed from midnight until 5-6am. All day/night I thought I\u2019d have to end my life rather than go more days like this. The next few days got gradually better and the pharmacists were horrified I was prescribed so badly. But ever since then, I have been on 100mg Lamotrigine + 1g Keppra morning then 1g Keppra at night and regularly have myoclonic seizures while trying to fall asleep so have to take Clobazam. Sorry for the novel, but why has everything gone so downhill?? If it makes a difference, I have a history of quite intense mental health issues though never formally diagnosed (not my fault lol). 100% have depression and anxiety (don't know if it borders on panic), think I had BPD, have had major eating problems (binge/restricting), used to think I had ADD, suspect I could be vaguely on the autism spectrum.

You were initially treated with Lamotrigine (100mg twice a day) until 2020, then switched to Keppra (500mg twice a day).\n\n**Withdrawal of medication**\n\nIn 2021, you were told to stop medication after being seizure-free for three years. However, you continued to experience myoclonic seizures, especially when you had sleep problems.

The emergency room visit led to an adjustment in your medication, and you are now taking 100mg Lamotrigine and 1g Keppra twice a day, with Clobazam as needed.\n\n**EEG results**\n\nYour EEG results from 2022 (before stopping medication) and the most recent one show:\n\n* Normal alpha activity (9 Hz)\n* Absent or irregular delta activity\n* Absent theta activity\n* Normal stop reaction and fast rhythms\n* No paroxysmal activity (which refers to abnormal electrical discharges in the brain)\n* Normal reaction to photostimulation and hyperventilation (although the latter was not tested in the most recent EEG)\n\nThe conclusion of the most recent EEG mentions \"foyer de ralentissement localis\u00e9 fronto-temporal bilat\u00e9ral intermittent,\" which translates to \" localized intermittent slowing in the bilateral fronto-temporal region.\" This suggests that there may be some abnormalities in the electrical activity in the fronto-temporal regions of your brain, but no clear epileptiform anomalies (abnormalities that are typical of epilepsy) were detected.\n\n**Potential reasons for the downturn**\n\nSeveral factors might have contributed to the recent worsening of your seizures:\n\n1. **Inadequate medication adjustment**: The sudden switch from Keppra to a low dose of Lamotrigine might have led to a withdrawal effect, causing an increase in seizure activity.\n2. **Insufficient dosage**: The current dosage of Lamotrigine (100mg) might be too low to effectively control your seizures, especially considering your previous dosage (200mg).\n3. **Sleep disturbances**: Sleep problems can trigger seizures, and it's possible that the sleep disturbances you experienced contributed to the breakthrough seizure and subsequent myoclonic seizures.\n4. **Mental health factors**: Your history of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues might be influencing your seizure activity or vice versa. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate seizure disorders.\n5. **EEG findings**: The localized slowing in the fronto-temporal region might indicate some underlying brain activity that could be contributing to your seizures.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your medication**: Consult with your neurologist to reassess your medication regimen, considering your previous response to higher doses of Lamotrigine and the potential need for a more gradual tapering or adjustment.\n2. **Address sleep disturbances**: Work on establishing a consistent sleep schedule, and explore strategies to improve sleep quality, such as relaxation techniques or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).\n3. **Manage mental health**: Continue to address your mental health issues through therapy, self-care, and stress management techniques.\n4. **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regularly monitor your seizure activity, and schedule follow-up appointments with your neurologist to adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nPlease consult your neurologist and healthcare team to discuss these recommendations and develop a personalized plan to better manage your epilepsy and overall health."

        "question": "I, 16(AFAB)(Diagnosed with ASD, GAD, MMD, and ADHD, no physical conditions known, I don't take any medication or supplements whatsoever), have been consistently baffled by what keeps occuring. I have no idea where to look anymore, and this is honestly a last ditch effort to at least point me in the right direction.Starting when I was around 11 years old, periodically, I'd go through a \"episode\" of sorts where exactly half my body would become completely numb and it became difficult to communicate. When I was 12, this happened during school, and it was so bad I ended up being sent to the hospital. I believe I received an MRI among a few other tests, but ultimately, the episode was over by the time I had arrived. The doctors said I was fine and I was sent home, but since then I have had about 8 more of these episodes.When this occurs, it starts by my entire arm slowly going numb, which spreads through one side of my body, almost as if there's a line going all the way down. The weirdest part is that it's exactly half, and that includes all of that half (no joke, half my tounge and nose too) will go completely numb. Sometimes I will get an extraordinary horrible headache during this that lasts about 5 hours, which makes me incredibly sensitive to any form of light or sound. As mentioned previously, I lose the ability to communicate, but not the ability to think. I am able to recognize what my body is going through the entire time, but all that I am able to do is I suppose cry and wail. I lose the ability to speak English. Sometimes I am able to delay these episodes by doing breathing exercises, but ultimately it's only a delay, and I end up losing vision entirely for at least 15 minutes during this.I have no idea why this happens, as the circumstances are different every time. It seems to be entirely random and completely cripples me for at least 2 hours. I want to know what it is so I can research it and hopefully focus on preventing it, or at least lessening the effects.Any ideas?",

        "answer": "I'm glad you've reached out for help. Your experiences sound incredibly distressing and debilitating. I'll try to provide some guidance, but please note that I'm not a medical professional, and only a qualified doctor can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nThat being said, your descriptions suggest a complex condition that may involve neurological and possibly psychological components. I'll highlight some potential areas to explore, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n1. **Neurological conditions:** Your symptoms, particularly the numbness and loss of motor function on one side of the body, could be related to conditions like:\n\t* Hemiplegic migraine: A rare type of migraine that can cause numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the body.\n\t* Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or \"mini-stroke\": Although unlikely at your age, TIA can cause sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body.\n\t* Multiple sclerosis (MS): An autoimmune disease that can cause numbness, weakness, and vision problems, although MS typically has a more gradual onset.\n2. **Psychological factors:** Your history of anxiety disorders (GAD) and ADHD might be contributing to or exacerbating your symptoms. Stress, anxiety, and panic attacks can manifest physically, including numbness, headaches, and difficulty communicating.\n3. **Sensory processing and integration:** Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may experience sensory processing difficulties, which could lead to unusual sensory experiences, including numbness or altered perception.\n4. **Other possibilities:**\n\t* Complex partial seizures: Although less likely, these seizures can cause altered consciousness, numbness, and difficulty communicating.\n\t* Conversion disorder (Functional neurological symptom disorder): A condition where psychological distress is converted into physical symptoms, which can be distressing and debilitating.\n\nGiven the complexity of your symptoms and medical history, it's crucial to consult with a neurologist or a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurologist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. They can help:\n\n1. Rule out underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n2. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including:\n\t* Neurological examination\n\t* EEG (electroencephalogram) or other neuroimaging tests (e.g., MRI) to rule out structural abnormalities\n\t* Psychological assessments to evaluate anxiety, stress, and coping mechanisms\n3. Develop a personalized treatment plan to address your symptoms and underlying conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, consider keeping a symptom journal to track:\n\n1. The timing and duration of your episodes\n2. Any potential triggers or preceding events\n3. The severity of your symptoms\n4. Any strategies that help alleviate or delay your episodes (e.g., breathing exercises)\n\nThis information will be invaluable in helping your healthcare team understand your experiences and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They can help you navigate the diagnostic process and develop a personalized plan to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life."

I used to have these shoulder jerks that would last one second, then my whole body started moving in all directions like few months later. For some time it was fine and recently my head started jerking so i finally went to a neuro. The EEG was fine. Looking at my posture and the way i was standing the doc said I've motor tics and AD/HD. So I've been given Tetrabenazine for these movements, Clonidine for ADHD and also Clonazepam 0.25 for emergency when I'm having too many jerks. A quick look at google told me that Clonazepam is used to treat Myoclonic Epilepsy. Should i be worried about these jerks situation because apparently doc Haven't ruled out epilepsy",

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information and insights. It's essential to consult your neurologist for personalized advice and concerns.\r\n\r\nThat being said, let's break down the situation:\r\n\r\n1. **Initial symptoms and diagnosis**: You experienced shoulder jerks, which progressed to whole-body movements, and later, head jerks. Your neurologist diagnosed you with motor tics and ADHD, based on your posture and behavior.\r\n2. **EEG results**: The EEG (electroencephalogram) was normal, which suggests that there is no obvious abnormal electrical activity in your brain that would indicate epilepsy.\r\n3. **Medications prescribed**:\r\n\t* Tetrabenazine: typically used to treat chorea (involuntary, abrupt movements) associated with Huntington's disease, but can also be used off-label for other movement disorders like motor tics.\r\n\t* Clonidine: often used to treat ADHD, high blood pressure, and certain pain conditions.\r\n\t* Clonazepam: a benzodiazepine used to treat various conditions, including anxiety, seizures, and movement disorders like myoclonic epilepsy.\r\n4. **Google search and concerns**: You're worried because Clonazepam is sometimes used to treat myoclonic epilepsy, and you're unsure if your doctor has ruled out epilepsy.\r\n\r\nConsider the following points:\r\n\r\n* **Myoclonic epilepsy** is a specific type of epilepsy characterized by brief, shock-like jerks or seizures. While Clonazepam is used to treat myoclonic epilepsy, it's also used for other conditions, like anxiety and movement disorders.\r\n* **Motor tics** are involuntary, repetitive movements that can be similar to myoclonic jerks. Your neurologist has diagnosed you with motor tics, which might be related to your ADHD or another underlying condition.\r\n* **EEG results**: Although the EEG was normal, it's essential to note that a normal EEG doesn't completely rule out epilepsy. However, it reduces the likelihood of epilepsy being the primary cause of your symptoms.\r\n* **Clonazepam prescription**: Your doctor prescribed Clonazepam for emergency situations, which might indicate that they're trying to manage your symptoms, rather than definitively treating epilepsy.\r\n\r\nTo address your concerns, consider the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Schedule a follow-up appointment** with your neurologist to discuss your concerns and ask questions.\r\n2. **Clarify the diagnosis**: Ask your doctor to explain the reasoning behind the motor tics and ADHD diagnosis, and how they relate to your symptoms.\r\n3. **Epilepsy evaluation**: Discuss the EEG results and ask if your doctor has ruled out epilepsy or if further testing is needed.\r\n4. **Medication management**: Understand the purpose of each medication, potential side effects, and how they'll be monitored.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to understand your condition and develop an effective treatment plan. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you're unsure about your diagnosis or treatment."

        "question": "20 y/o USA white female, 5'5\" 145 lbs, currently taking Zoloft, Lamictal (as a mood stabilizer, I'm not epileptic), and have an IUD if that counts as a current med?My psychiatrist and therapist both think I might have atypical ADHD and we're trying out different meds to see if they help. My psychiatrist put me on low-dose Concerta for about 2 weeks and told me to work my way up to 3 pills as a single dose, spending a few days on 1 pill and then a few days on 2 pills and that if it felt like it was working well at a dosage below 3 pills, to just stick with that. I was having some air hunger then but not as much as I currently am. The Concerta was giving me mood swings at the dose where it started to feel like it was working (3 pills) so she decided to have me try Vyvanse instead.It's only my second day on Vyvanse and I'm no stranger to waiting out initial side effects or even to dealing with long-term side effects that suck but suck less than not being medicated for the condition but the air hunger is really getting to me.I'm a classical singer so I do know how to take legitimately full breaths and have been going through the motions of taking full breaths but still never feel like I've got a full breath. I'm not panting or something like that, I'm breathing normally, it just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the air I need. Yawning helps me feel like I got a full breath but only until the next breath and I can't just try to yawn for every breath because while the Vyvanse isn't making me constantly nauseous, it makes it way easier for me to be nauseated and if I yawn too hard too much, I get nauseous.Is there anything I can do? Like I said, I'm hoping that the air hunger will go away once my system gets more used to the Vyvanse but in the meantime I'd really love not to feel this way.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're working closely with your psychiatrist and therapist to find the right medication for your potential atypical ADHD. I'll do my best to offer some suggestions to help you cope with the air hunger side effect.\n\n**Understanding air hunger**\nAir hunger, also known as dyspnea, is a common side effect of stimulant medications like Vyvanse and Concerta. It's not a sign of a respiratory problem, but rather a subjective feeling of not being able to breathe fully. This sensation can be uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking.\n\n**Short-term coping strategies**\n\n1. **Deep breathing exercises**: As a classical singer, you're already familiar with proper breathing techniques. Continue to practice deep, diaphragmatic breathing exercises to help manage air hunger. You can try inhaling for a count of 4, holding for a count of 4, and exhaling for a count of 4.\n2. **Yawning**: As you've discovered, yawning can provide temporary relief. Try to yawn gently, without straining or triggering nausea.\n3. **Relaxation techniques**: Stress and anxiety can exacerbate air hunger. Engage in relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or mindfulness meditation to help calm your mind and body.\n4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help thin out mucus and keep your airways moist.\n\n**Potential long-term solutions**\n\n1. **Dose adjustment**: If the air hunger persists, your psychiatrist may consider adjusting the dose of Vyvanse or switching to a different medication.\n2. **Add-on medication**: In some cases, a medication like a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol) may be prescribed to help alleviate stimulant-induced anxiety and air hunger.\n3. **Alternative therapies**: Your psychiatrist or therapist may recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other therapies to help you cope with anxiety and manage stress.\n\n**When to seek medical attention**\nIf you experience any of the following, seek medical attention:\n\n* Severe air hunger that interferes with daily activities\n* Chest pain or discomfort\n* Rapid heartbeat or palpitations\n* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n* Severe nausea or vomiting\n\n**Next steps**\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with your psychiatrist to discuss your experiences with Vyvanse, including the air hunger side effect. Be sure to share the following:\n\n* The severity and duration of air hunger\n* Any changes in your symptoms or side effects\n* Your concerns and any questions you have\n\nBy working closely with your healthcare team, you can find ways to manage air hunger and optimize your treatment plan."

I think I also have non-epileptic seizures from anxiety due to the different characteristics of PNES vs ES. However, when I was 12 right after puberty, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to understand speech and I had depersonalization, trembling, ptosis (one eyebrow or eyelid drooping usually in the morning after sleep) and sometimes blurry vision, usually accompanied by AIWS and panic attack, however, at random days I would get blurry vision easily, all these problems were usually accompanied by a food intolerance and would significantly improve a few minutes after passing stool, yet require a day or two to fully subside. Now at 19 I still get these symptoms but much more mild, after eating a food I\u2019m intolerant to, I get slightly blurry vision and panic, then when I slept I woke up in the middle of the night with panic/depersonalization/trembling and restricted circulation and my hearing sounded a little foggy and I had slight trouble understanding words and whenever someone looks at or talks to me I panic and have to hide in my room to block out the sensory, my mouth is also numb and eating food feels weird and gives me a panic attack and then I have to go to the bathroom, after passing stool of the irritating food, the symptoms elevate significantly, I get back the feeling sensation in my mouth and body but just feel very subtly numb for the rest of the day.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll try to provide some insights and potential connections between your symptoms. Please note that it's essential to consult a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIt seems like you've been experiencing a range of symptoms, including:\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal issues**: Food intolerance, abdominal discomfort, and bowel movements seem to be triggering or alleviating your symptoms.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: Blurry vision, trembling, ptosis (eyelid drooping), depersonalization, and numbness in the mouth and body.\n3. **Anxiety and panic**: Panic attacks, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors (hiding in your room) are prominent.\n4. **Cognitive symptoms**: Difficulty understanding speech, foggy hearing, and trouble with sensory processing.\n\nConsidering your symptoms started around puberty, it's possible that hormonal changes may have contributed to the onset. The fact that your blood and heart tests were fine at age 12 suggests that a cardiovascular or hematological disorder is less likely.\n\nThe combination of gastrointestinal issues, anxiety, and neurological symptoms might suggest a few potential underlying conditions or contributing factors:\n\n1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: Food intolerance, abdominal discomfort, and bowel movements triggering symptoms are common in IBS. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate IBS symptoms.\n2. **Anxiety disorders**: Your anxiety and panic attacks could be related to an underlying anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder.\n3. **Non-epileptic seizures (PNES)**: As you mentioned, your symptoms might be consistent with PNES, which can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or other emotional factors.\n4. **Migraines or other headache disorders**: Blurry vision, numbness, and sensitivity to sensory stimuli can be symptoms of migraines or other headache disorders.\n5. **Autonomic nervous system dysfunction**: Your symptoms, such as tremors, numbness, and circulation issues, might be related to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various bodily functions, including heart rate, digestion, and blood pressure.\n\nTo better understand your condition, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult a gastroenterologist**: Rule out any underlying gastrointestinal conditions, such as IBS, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n2. **See a neurologist**: Discuss your neurological symptoms, including the possibility of PNES, migraines, or other conditions.\n3. **Talk to a mental health professional**: Address your anxiety and panic attacks, and explore coping strategies and therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).\n4. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your symptoms, including when they occur, what triggers them, and how they relate to your bowel movements, food intake, and stress levels.\n5. **Explore stress management techniques**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, to help manage your anxiety and potentially alleviate symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work with a healthcare team to determine the underlying causes of your symptoms and develop a comprehensive treatment plan."

        "question": "So I was diagnosed with Epilepsy last August and put on Keppra 1000mg twice a day. I did not like how it made me feel, so they moved it to once a day. Still, at times I feel foggy....seeming almost drunk. I was wondering if this is normal or maybe I was taking it at the wrong time of day. Should I take with food? Should I take before bed? I am not on any other meds except Motrin 800 for fake hip. Please let me know what you would recommend. Thank you in advance. I am a 41 year old male, 190 pounds and not a smoker.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given your experience with Keppra (levetiracetam) and the side effects you're describing, such as feeling \"foggy\" or \"almost drunk,\" it's understandable that you're looking for ways to manage these effects. I'll provide some general guidance, but it's important to consult your healthcare provider or neurologist for personalized advice, as they can assess your specific situation and make adjustments accordingly.\n\n### Taking Keppra with Food\nTaking Keppra with food can help minimize gastrointestinal side effects like nausea or an upset stomach, which some people experience. However, it may not directly impact the central nervous system side effects you're describing, like feeling foggy. The medication's absorption can be affected by food, potentially leading to slower absorption when taken with a meal, which might influence how the drug affects you, but this can vary from person to person.\n\n### Timing of Dose\nThe timing of your Keppra dose can potentially impact how you feel. If you're experiencing significant side effects during the day that interfere with your daily activities, discussing an alternative timing with your healthcare provider might be beneficial. Taking it before bed could be an option to explore, but this needs to be done under medical guidance. Some people find that taking their medication at bedtime helps minimize daytime side effects, but it's crucial to ensure this doesn't negatively impact your sleep or increase the risk of other side effects.\n\n### Interactions with Other Medications\nYou mentioned taking Motrin 800mg for your hip. While there's no direct, significant interaction between ibuprofen (Motrin) and levetiracetam (Keppra) that would typically cause the symptoms you're describing, it's always good to review all your medications with your healthcare provider to ensure there are no potential interactions, especially if you're taking any other over-the-counter medications or supplements.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. **Consult Your Healthcare Provider**: Discuss your side effects in detail with your neurologist. They can provide personalized advice based on your medical history, the severity of your epilepsy, and how you've responded to the medication so far.\n2. **Keep a Medication Diary**: Tracking when you take your medication and any side effects you experience can help identify patterns. This information can be invaluable when discussing adjustments with your healthcare provider.\n3. **Dose Adjustment or Alternative Medication**: Depending on the severity of your side effects and the effectiveness of the medication in controlling your seizures, your healthcare provider might consider adjusting your dose or switching you to a different medication.\n4. **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Sometimes, lifestyle changes can help mitigate side effects. Ensuring you're getting enough sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular physical activity (as recommended by your healthcare provider) can help manage side effects.\n\nRemember, the management of epilepsy and its treatment is highly individualized. What works for one person may not work for another. Open communication with your healthcare provider is key to finding the right balance between controlling your seizures and minimizing side effects."

        "question": "Hi there. I was hoping someone could give me some input on an MRI view. I have access to the MRI so if anyone wants another image, I can view it. This is my most recent MRI, Jan 2021. I also have a disk with the MRI/MRA/MRV I had in 2019 History: 32F. I have a CVST in 2019 on the right side of my brain. This included my superior sagittal sinus, part of my transverse sinus, my sigmoid sinus, and then went down into my jugular. I\u2019m heterozygous Factor V Leiden. Other than that I didn\u2019t get any real information on the cause. I had a DVT in 2012. My eye doctor says my peripheral vision in my right eye isn\u2019t great. I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy, being complex partial seizures that originate in my right temporal lobe. I get de ja vu, kinda black out, zone out. Sometimes I can tell when this happens, other times I have been driving and suddenly not known where I was. Apparently I clench my teeth often, and I also sometimes stutter randomly, like I\u2019ll say \u201cand\u201d a bunch of times in a row for no reason. Around the time the CVST happened, I developed some symptoms that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re related (but I blame stress). These include temperature regulation issues, mostly when I sleep. Sleep paralysis/some hallucinations/terrors. And insomnia, which I think is just from fear of sleep paralysis. My psychiatrist did say I was having something called exploding head syndrome, which again, I think is just me mentally being terrified to sleep and I jolt myself out of sleeping. The temperature thing includes randomly burning up or freezing, sometimes sweating. Blanket amount and house temp don\u2019t seem to vary this. My boyfriend will either cover me in blankets or ice packs. I have passed out from the heat part if I try to get up. The cold part, I just shake and chatter. These are all ongoing. I currently take Eliquis, propranolol, Keppra, and have taken Vyvanse, Xanax, prazosin, and Ambien, all as prescribed. I stopped taking the Vyvanse about six months ago. The Xanax is occasionally, and the Ambien is rarely. I take vitamin D and a B complex. I drank occasionally but since the epilepsy diagnosis, have cut back. I don\u2019t do any other drugs. Warfarin made me bleed insanely and Zonisamide made me extremely sick. My neurologist wants to send me to Cornell or similar and I guess I\u2019m just trying to avoid everything with Covid going on if I can. Sorry if this post is a little wonky, I\u2019m going on about two days of no sleep. I will try to clarify any questions. Edit: oh I\u2019m 5\u20194, white, and 180lbs. I put on weight since the CVST. I was originally around 140-150lbs. I used to get severe migraines, since I was a child. I would lose vision, not be able to speak, and it felt like someone beat my head in. Since seeing my new neurologist in 2019 and being diagnosed with the CVST and medicated with Eliquis, I have rarely had migraines.",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through all this. It sounds incredibly challenging and overwhelming. I'll do my best to provide some insights and ask questions to help you better understand your situation.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's impressive you're taking proactive steps to understand your condition, especially given your sleep-deprived state. \n\nTo start, it's essential to recognize that your medical history is complex, and it's great that you're considering seeking specialized care at Cornell or a similar institution. However, I understand your concerns about traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLet's break down some of the key points from your history:\n\n1. **CVST (Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis) in 2019**: This is a rare condition, and it's good that you're on Eliquis to prevent further clotting. The fact that you have Factor V Leiden mutation increases your risk for blood clots.\n2. **Epilepsy diagnosis**: The complex partial seizures originating from your right temporal lobe could be related to the CVST or other underlying factors. The seizures might be contributing to some of your symptoms, such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, zoning out, and stuttering.\n3. **Sleep disturbances**: Your temperature regulation issues, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and insomnia could be related to the stress and anxiety caused by your CVST and epilepsy. Exploding head syndrome, as diagnosed by your psychiatrist, might be a manifestation of your stress and anxiety.\n4. **Medications**: You're on a range of medications, including anticoagulants (Eliquis), anti-seizure medications (Keppra), and others. It's essential to discuss any potential side effects or interactions with your neurologist.\n5. **Weight gain**: The significant weight gain since the CVST might be contributing to some of your symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and temperature regulation issues.\n\nTo better understand your situation, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for your seizures or sleep disturbances?\n2. How often do you experience the temperature regulation issues, and have you noticed any correlations with your seizures or other symptoms?\n3. Have you discussed your sleep disturbances and temperature regulation issues with your neurologist, and what were their thoughts on potential causes or treatments?\n4. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, or cognitive difficulties, that might be related to your CVST or epilepsy?\n\nFeel free to provide any additional information or clarify any points I've mentioned. I'll do my best to help you understand your situation and explore potential next steps."

        "question": "This last year at the ripe age of 32 I developed a myriad of health complications. Primarily nuerological comlications such as myoclonus, seizures, and a serious case of insomnia. Thankfully I am improving now. I was in excellent former health and this came on like wildfire. For 6 months I was in and out of hospitals. I had 6 MRIs done, 4 lumbar punctures, and 7 CT scans in the span of 6 months. The majority of the diagnostics were of low clinical yield and I was empirically treated for autoimmune conditions & epilepsy. I often feel that the excessive imaging(CT) only added insult to injury. I know this is already said and done and there's nothing I can do about it now, but im hoping maybe someone with a bit of knowledge and insight on the subject could ease my nerves about cancer risk etc. Below are the scans preformed and parameters that were made available to me. Where do I stand I'm comparison to radiation workers, patients treated with radiation therapy or gamma procedures, pilots, surviovors of eratic radiation exposure etc. I want to put these worries to rest and move forward with my life. Yes it's a simple as nothing I can do now but move forward and enjoy life. I'm just hoping to hear some people who may have gone through it and shared these worries that your all ok, or for someone with a background and focus in radiation(be it medicine, physics, engineering, etc)to tell me my worries are irrational.

        "answer": "I'll provide you with some insights and comparisons to help alleviate your concerns.\n\nFirst, let's discuss the radiation doses from your CT scans. The dose-length product (DLP) is a measure of the total amount of radiation exposure during a CT scan. To put your DLP values into perspective:\n\n* A typical chest CT scan has a DLP of around 300-400 mGy/cm.\n* A head CT scan typically has a DLP of around 1000-1500 mGy/cm.\n\nYour CT scans have the following DLP values:\n* Head scans: 1005.29, 799, 763, and 881.17 mGy/cm (all within or slightly above the typical range)\n* Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis scans: 652 and 1291.11 mGy/cm (first one is relatively low, second one is higher due to the use of contrast)\n\nTo estimate your total radiation exposure, we can calculate the effective dose (E) from each scan. The effective dose is a measure of the overall risk from radiation exposure, taking into account the sensitivity of different organs and tissues.\n\nUsing the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) guidelines, we can estimate the effective dose from each scan:\n\n* Head scans: approximately 2-3 mSv (millisieverts) per scan\n* Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis scans: approximately 10-15 mSv per scan (without contrast) and 20-25 mSv per scan (with contrast)\n\nYour total effective dose from the CT scans can be estimated as follows:\n* Head scans: 4-6 scans \\* 2.5 mSv/scan \u2248 10-15 mSv\n* Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis scans: 2 scans \\* 15 mSv/scan (avg) \u2248 30 mSv\n\nAdding these up, your total estimated effective dose from the CT scans is around 40-45 mSv.\n\nNow, let's compare this to other groups:\n\n* **Radiation workers**: The recommended annual limit for radiation workers is 50 mSv. You've received approximately 40-45 mSv in 6 months, which is relatively high but still below the annual limit.\n* **Patients treated with radiation therapy**: Cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy can receive doses ranging from 20-80 Gy (2000-8000 mSv) or more, depending on the type and location of the cancer.\n* **Pilots**: Commercial airline pilots might receive an annual dose of around 2-5 mSv due to cosmic radiation at high altitudes.\n* **Survivors of erratic radiation exposure**: People exposed to radiation from nuclear accidents or other incidents might receive highly variable doses, but these are often much higher than what you've received.\n\nRegarding your PET scan, the **Total Exam DLP** is not directly provided, but we can estimate the dose. A typical full-body PET scan has an effective dose of around 10-20 mSv. However, this value can vary depending on the specific protocol and tracer used.\n\nTo put your worries into perspective:\n\n* The estimated lifetime risk of developing cancer from a 40-45 mSv dose is relatively low, around 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 500, depending on various factors like age, sex, and individual sensitivity.\n* The American College of Radiology (ACR) and other organizations emphasize that the benefits of medically necessary imaging, like your CT scans, outweigh the potential risks.\n\nIt's essential to note that your medical team likely took necessary precautions to minimize radiation exposure, such as using the lowest possible doses required for diagnostic purposes.\n\nWhile it's natural to have concerns, it's also important to remember that:\n\n1. You received these scans under medical supervision, and the benefits of the diagnostic information likely outweighed the potential risks.\n2. The doses you received, although relatively high, are still within the ranges encountered by some occupational groups and patients undergoing radiation therapy.\n3. Your risk of developing cancer from this exposure is relatively low.\n\nI hope this information helps alleviate your worries. Try to focus on your recovery and the fact that you're improving. Enjoy your life, and don't hesitate to discuss any lingering concerns with your medical team or a qualified expert in radiation safety."

        "question": "Suddenly, everywhere I look, people are touting the benefits of stimulating the vagus nerve. What is the vagus nerve, and what does it actually do? Does stimulating it actually have all these positive effects people claim? (Stimulating digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping anxiety, etc.) 35/F/white/115 pounds/sertraline/Canada. Is stimulating the vagus nerve bullshit?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "The vagus nerve! It's indeed a fascinating topic, and I'm happy to break it down for you.\n\n**What is the vagus nerve?**\n\nThe vagus nerve, also known as the tenth cranial nerve, is a complex and multifaceted nerve that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. It's a mixed nerve, meaning it contains both sensory and motor fibers. The vagus nerve originates in the brainstem and extends down to the abdomen, passing through the neck and thorax.\n\n**What does the vagus nerve do?**\n\nThe vagus nerve is involved in a wide range of functions, including:\n\n1. **Parasympathetic nervous system regulation**: The vagus nerve is a key player in the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and conserves energy.\n2. **Digestion**: The vagus nerve regulates gut motility, secretion, and blood flow, which helps with digestion and absorption of nutrients.\n3. **Heart rate and blood pressure**: The vagus nerve helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure by promoting the release of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, which slows down heart rate and lowers blood pressure.\n4. **Respiration**: The vagus nerve is involved in the regulation of breathing, particularly in response to stress or exercise.\n5. **Vocalization and swallowing**: The vagus nerve controls the muscles involved in vocalization and swallowing.\n6. **Sensory input**: The vagus nerve transmits sensory information from the throat, lungs, and abdominal organs to the brain.\n\n**Does stimulating the vagus nerve have positive effects?**\n\nStimulating the vagus nerve has been shown to have various benefits, including:\n\n1. **Improved digestion**: Vagal stimulation can enhance gut motility and secretion, which may help with conditions like constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n2. **Lower blood pressure**: Activation of the vagus nerve can help reduce blood pressure by promoting the release of neurotransmitters that slow down heart rate and dilate blood vessels.\n3. **Anxiety and stress reduction**: Vagal stimulation can activate the PNS, which can help reduce anxiety and stress by promoting relaxation and calming the mind.\n4. **Improved mood**: The vagus nerve is involved in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which can help regulate mood.\n5. **Neuroprotection**: Vagal stimulation may have neuroprotective effects, potentially helping to prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\n**How to stimulate the vagus nerve?**\n\nThere are several ways to stimulate the vagus nerve, including:\n\n1. **Deep breathing exercises**: Slow, deep breathing can help activate the vagus nerve and promote relaxation.\n2. **Meditation and yoga**: These practices can help stimulate the vagus nerve and promote parasympathetic activity.\n3. **Cold showers**: Taking regular cold showers can help stimulate the vagus nerve and increase the release of certain neurotransmitters.\n4. **Exercise**: Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, can help stimulate the vagus nerve and improve cardiovascular health.\n5. **Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy**: This is a medical treatment that involves implanting a device that delivers electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. VNS therapy is typically used to treat epilepsy, depression, and other conditions.\n\n**Is stimulating the vagus nerve \"bullshit\"?**\n\nNot entirely! While some claims about vagus nerve stimulation might be exaggerated or lacking in scientific evidence, the nerve itself is a real and important part of our anatomy. The benefits of vagus nerve stimulation are supported by some scientific research, but it's essential to approach these claims with a critical and nuanced perspective.\n\nAs with any health-related topic, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new therapies or treatments, especially if you have any underlying medical conditions or take medications like sertraline.\n\nIn your case, as a 35-year-old woman taking sertraline, it's essential to discuss any new therapies or treatments with your healthcare provider to ensure they won't interact with your medication or exacerbate any underlying conditions.\n\nI hope this helps you navigate the world of vagus nerve stimulation!"

        "question": "i was diagnosed when i was young with a seizure thing that goes away when youre 13, which impairs my ability to concentrate and gave me seizures while im sleeping about once every blood moon and my mom told me it was epilepsy, but see the thing is that shes not very good with english, and i have never had any trouble with seeing flashing lights. is it possible to have epilepsy but no trouble with seeing flashing colors?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're taking the initiative to understand your condition better.\n\nFirstly, it's possible that your mom may have misinterpreted or mistranslated the diagnosis, given the language barrier. However, it's also possible that you were indeed diagnosed with a form of epilepsy.\n\nEpilepsy is a broad term that encompasses a range of seizure disorders, and not all types of epilepsy are triggered by visual stimuli like flashing lights. Some people with epilepsy may experience seizures due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Genetic predisposition**: Some forms of epilepsy are inherited and can cause seizures without any specific triggers.\n2. **Brain structure abnormalities**: Certain brain malformations or injuries can lead to epilepsy.\n3. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, like those that occur during sleep or puberty, can trigger seizures in some individuals.\n4. **Sleep patterns**: As you mentioned, some people experience seizures during sleep, which can be related to specific sleep stages or disorders.\n\nThe fact that you experience seizures about once every \"blood moon\" (which occurs approximately every 2.5 years) suggests that your seizures might be related to hormonal or circadian rhythms.\n\nRegarding your ability to concentrate, epilepsy can indeed affect attention and cognitive function, especially if seizures occur during sleep or if you're experiencing subtle seizures (e.g., absence seizures) during the day.\n\nTo clarify your diagnosis and understand your condition better, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult your medical records**: Try to obtain a copy of your original diagnosis and medical records from your childhood. This can help you understand the specifics of your condition.\n2. **Schedule a follow-up appointment**: Visit a neurologist or a pediatric neurologist (if you're still young) to discuss your symptoms, medical history, and any concerns you may have. They can assess your condition and provide a more accurate diagnosis.\n3. **Ask about EEG tests**: An electroencephalogram (EEG) can help diagnose and monitor epilepsy. If you haven't had an EEG recently, your doctor may recommend one to assess your brain activity.\n4. **Discuss your symptoms in detail**: Share your experiences, including your concentration difficulties and sleep-related seizures, with your doctor. This will help them better understand your condition and provide guidance on managing your symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. They can help you understand your condition, develop a treatment plan, and improve your overall quality of life.\n\nKeep in mind that epilepsy is a spectrum, and not everyone experiences the same symptoms or triggers. It's possible to have epilepsy without being sensitive to flashing lights or colors.\n\nI hope this information helps you feel more empowered to take control of your health. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"

Shortly after I had my new iud put in I started having issues with my left eye, vision became blurry\u201dish\u201d on and off. For the next 3 weeks I Had slow thought processing during the time & some confusion. - Hard time finding words. I also had some \u201cleft neglect\u201d symptoms but that\u2019s normal for me when I get migraines because my left side goes numb so I related all of this to stress & the migraines until I started having muscle twitching in my left hand & wrist. - I started to improve end of March but My vision is still off sometimes & I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be. I Had an eeg in April which showed slowing, which I feel like is normal.. but I just had a follow up MRI & this is the report.. is someone able to explain it to me? No one has ever told me I had radiation necrosis. I guess I was always under the assumption my brain would heal itself after my radiation\u2026 but 4 years later it just seems to be getting worse.

I don\u2019t see a dr until June and google is not my friend.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to help you understand your MRI report and provide some general information about radiation necrosis. Please note that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult with your doctor for personalized advice and interpretation of your results.\n\n**Radiation Necrosis:**\n\nRadiation necrosis is a potential side effect of radiation therapy, including Gamma Knife treatments. It occurs when the radiation damages the brain tissue, leading to inflammation, scarring, and cell death. The condition can cause symptoms similar to those you're experiencing, such as cognitive decline, vision changes, and motor weakness.\n\n**Healing and Progression:**\n\nRadiation necrosis can be a chronic condition, and its progression can be unpredictable. While some cases may stabilize or improve over time, others may worsen. The fact that you're experiencing ongoing symptoms 4 years after radiation therapy suggests that the condition may be progressing. However, it's essential to note that the rate of progression can vary significantly between individuals.\n\n**Danger and Risks:**\n\nRadiation necrosis can be a serious condition, and if left untreated, it may lead to further brain damage, cognitive decline, and increased risk of seizures or other neurological complications. In rare cases, it can also increase the risk of brain edema (swelling), which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.\n\n**Swelling vs. Radiation Necrosis:**\n\nWhile swelling (edema) can be a symptom of radiation necrosis, it's not the same thing. Edema is a temporary condition that can be treated with medication, whereas radiation necrosis is a more chronic condition that requires ongoing management.\n\n**Comparison to Ischemic Stroke:**\n\nRadiation necrosis and ischemic stroke share some similarities, as both conditions can cause brain tissue damage. However, the underlying mechanisms are different. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to a part of the brain, while radiation necrosis is caused by radiation damage to the brain tissue. While both conditions can lead to similar symptoms, the treatment approaches and outcomes may differ.\n\n**FLAIR Hyperintensity:**\n\nFLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is an MRI technique that highlights areas of brain injury or inflammation. FLAIR hyperintensity refers to the increased signal intensity in these areas, which can indicate a variety of conditions, including radiation necrosis, stroke, or other types of brain damage.\n\n**Your MRI Report:**\n\nWithout access to your actual MRI report, I can provide general guidance on what the radiologist might be looking for:\n\n* The report likely describes the location and extent of the radiation necrosis, as well as any changes since the previous scan.\n* The radiologist may have noted areas of FLAIR hyperintensity, which could indicate active inflammation or damage.\n* The report may also mention any changes in the size or appearance of the AVM or aneurysms.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nGiven your symptoms and the uncertainty surrounding your condition, it's essential to discuss your MRI results with your doctor in June. In the meantime, consider keeping a symptom journal to track any changes or worsening of your symptoms. This will help your doctor better understand your condition and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\nSome questions to ask your doctor:\n\n* What are the specifics of my radiation necrosis, and how has it progressed since the last scan?\n* What are the treatment options for radiation necrosis, and what are the potential risks and benefits?\n* How can we manage my symptoms, and what lifestyle changes can I make to improve my condition?\n* What are the chances of further brain damage or complications, and how can we monitor my condition?\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. Try to stay calm, and don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor if you have any further questions or concerns before your appointment in June."

Takes anti-depressant (can't remember the name) and Tegertol for seizures. I have been with my husband for 11 years, married for 10 years, so I haven't been a part of his entire journey, but I am here for the rest of it! He has been having increasing seizures in the last 7 years, and the neurologist just ups his meds. December of last year he had a big one. I had to call an ambulance because his active seizure was over 15 minutes. He stayed in a postectal state for over 5 hours. They did a CT scan, and it shows an area of calcification, and his neurologist said that is normal and unchanged.What I have noticed is that before his more major seizures, he will have a bad headache that advil or tylenol will not touch. Then a few hours later, he will have a seizure that will last between 3-5 minutes, with a postectal state ranging from 10 minutes to an hour.Is this something that can even be fixed or managed better? Is it just part of living with someone with epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're seeking answers and advocating for your husband's health! Given the complexity of his condition, I'll provide a neutral and informative response.\n\n**Summary of his condition:**\n\n* Epilepsy since birth\n* Corpus callosotomy (hemispheres separated) 15 years ago\n* Takes Tegretol for seizures and an anti-depressant (unknown name)\n* Increasing seizures over the past 7 years, with a notable increase in severity (e.g., the 15-minute seizure in December)\n* CT scan shows an area of calcification, deemed \"normal and unchanged\" by the neurologist\n* Pre-seizure headaches unresponsive to Advil or Tylenol, followed by seizures with postictal states\n\n**Potential concerns and considerations:**\n\n1. **Headaches as auras:** The headaches your husband experiences before seizures might be auras, which are warning signs that a seizure is approaching. Auras can manifest in various ways, including headaches, and may be related to the seizure focus or the brain's attempt to compensate for the upcoming seizure.\n2. **Seizure frequency and severity:** The increasing frequency and severity of seizures over the past 7 years, despite medication adjustments, may indicate that the epilepsy is not well-controlled. This could be due to various factors, such as medication resistance, underlying brain changes, or other health issues.\n3. **Calcification on CT scan:** While the neurologist deemed the calcification \"normal and unchanged,\" it's essential to consider the potential relationship between the calcification and the seizures. Calcifications can be a sign of underlying brain damage or scarring, which may contribute to seizure activity.\n4. **Medication management:** The current medication regimen, including Tegretol and an anti-depressant, may not be optimal for controlling seizures. It's possible that the medication doses, combinations, or types may need to be adjusted or changed to better manage the seizures.\n5. **Lifestyle and environmental factors:** As a supportive partner, you may want to explore potential lifestyle and environmental factors that could be contributing to the seizures, such as sleep patterns, stress levels, diet, and physical activity.\n\n**Potential next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult a comprehensive epilepsy center:** Consider seeking a second opinion or consultation at a comprehensive epilepsy center, where a team of experts, including neurologists, epileptologists, and other healthcare professionals, can evaluate your husband's condition and provide a more nuanced understanding of his epilepsy.\n2. **Review and adjust medication regimen:** Work with the neurologist to review the current medication regimen and consider adjustments or changes to better control seizures.\n3. **Explore alternative therapies:** Depending on the specific type of epilepsy and seizure activity, alternative therapies like vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), or dietary changes (e.g., ketogenic diet) may be considered.\n4. **Seizure monitoring and tracking:** Encourage your husband to keep a seizure diary to track the frequency, duration, and characteristics of his seizures. This information can help identify patterns and potential triggers, which can inform treatment decisions.\n5. **Support and education:** As a supportive partner, it's essential to educate yourself about epilepsy, its management, and the various treatment options available. This will enable you to better advocate for your husband's care and provide emotional support during this journey.\n\nWhile it's understandable that you want to know if this is \"just part of living with someone with epilepsy,\" it's essential to recognize that every individual's experience with epilepsy is unique. With the right combination of medical care, lifestyle adjustments, and support, it's possible to improve seizure control and overall quality of life."

        "question": "Age:20F Had been epileptic for 6 years but last seizure I had was 2 years ago.I have been getting this weird episodes for years now. I suddenly get a weird feeling of an attack/episode is going to happen, and then, I get this strong deja vu feeling about the situation I'm in has already happened, it sort of repeating? I suddenly get overwhelmed with fear and it comes along with panic attack. Heart palpitations, breathing problems(hyperventilation perhaps?), and then I don't really remember what happens. I'm confused after the episode about what really happened or triggered it. It last for an hour or so. It happens in sleep as well sometimes. Usually I end up sleeping after the episode since I get tired everytime it happens. Though, It affects me badly that I'm in fear all day, cause there seems to be lingering of that episode, like it's about to happen again.Yesterday I got about 5 or more episodes like that. 2 while sleeping I'm wondering if it's just because of anxiety issues(simply panic attacks) or is it related to Epilepsy? I have been taking medication once regularly- I take Levetiracetam-750",

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I'll try to provide some general insights and possible explanations for your experiences. However, please consult a neurologist or a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's great that you've been seizure-free for 2 years, and it's essential to explore the possible connections between your epilepsy history and these recent episodes.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms you described, such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, fear, panic, heart palpitations, and hyperventilation, can be associated with both anxiety disorders (e.g., panic attacks) and epilepsy-related conditions. The fact that you experience these episodes during sleep and wakefulness, and that they can be triggered by a sense of impending doom or anxiety, suggests a complex interplay between your brain's emotional and physiological responses.\r\n\r\nSome possible explanations for your episodes include:\r\n\r\n1. **Anxiety-related disorders**: Your symptoms could be related to an underlying anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, which can manifest with or without a clear trigger. The fact that you've been experiencing these episodes for years, and they've increased in frequency, might suggest an anxiety-related condition.\n2. **Epilepsy-related conditions**: Although you've been seizure-free for 2 years, it's possible that your brain is still experiencing abnormal electrical activity, which could be contributing to your symptoms. Conditions like complex partial seizures, simple partial seizures, or even aura (a warning sign before a seizure) could be involved.\n3. **Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)**: These are events that resemble epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal brain electrical activity. PNES can be triggered by psychological factors, such as stress, anxiety, or trauma.\n4. **Other possibilities**: Other conditions, like sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, insomnia), migraines, or even medication side effects, could also contribute to your symptoms.\n\nRegarding your medication, Levetiracetam (Keppra) is an antiepileptic drug that can help control seizures. However, it's essential to discuss your medication regimen with your doctor, as it may need to be adjusted or combined with other treatments to better manage your symptoms.\n\nTo better understand your condition, consider the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your episodes, including the time of day, triggers (if any), and symptoms. This can help identify patterns and potential correlations.\n2. **Consult your neurologist**: Share your symptoms and concerns with your doctor, and ask about the possibility of adjusting your medication or exploring other treatment options.\n3. **Counseling or therapy**: Consider seeking professional help to address any underlying anxiety or stress that may be contributing to your episodes.\n4. **Sleep study or EEG**: Your doctor may recommend a sleep study or an electroencephalogram (EEG) to monitor your brain activity during sleep and wakefulness, which can help identify any underlying seizure activity or other abnormalities.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to work with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of your episodes and develop an effective treatment plan to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might be going on. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nConsidering your symptoms, here are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Anemia-related symptoms**: Given your history of anemia, it's possible that your brain is not receiving enough oxygen, leading to feelings of lightheadedness and dizziness, especially when exhaling. Iron deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, fatigue, and dizziness.\n2. **Hyperventilation or breathing pattern**: Although you mentioned normal breathing rates, it's possible that your breathing pattern is affecting your blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. When you exhale, CO2 levels decrease, which can lead to feelings of lightheadedness and dizziness. This might be exacerbated by your anemia.\n3. **Iron supplements and interactions**: Iron pills, beef liver pills, and blood-building pills can interact with each other or have side effects that might contribute to your symptoms. For example, iron supplements can cause stomach upset, nausea, and dizziness.\n4. **Neurological symptoms**: The \"jerking\" and \"twitching\" you experience, especially upon waking, could be related to a variety of factors, including:\n\t* **Hypnic jerks**: These are sudden, brief contractions of the muscles that can occur when falling asleep or waking up.\n\t* **Anxiety or stress**: High levels of stress or anxiety can cause muscle tension, leading to jerking or twitching.\n\t* **Electrolyte imbalance**: An imbalance of essential minerals like potassium, calcium, or magnesium can cause muscle twitching or cramping.\n5. **Other potential causes**: Other conditions, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), dehydration, or sleep disorders, might contribute to your symptoms.\n\nTo better understand your symptoms, I recommend:\n\n1. **Consulting your doctor**: Share your symptoms and medical history with your doctor, and ask for a thorough evaluation.\n2. **Keeping a symptom journal**: Track your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers or relieving factors.\n3. **Monitoring your iron levels**: Ensure your iron levels are within a healthy range, and adjust your supplements as needed under medical guidance.\n4. **Exploring stress management techniques**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga, to help manage anxiety and stress.\n5. **Getting enough sleep and maintaining a balanced diet**: Prioritize a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and sufficient sleep, to help alleviate symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your symptoms and develop a personalized plan to address them."

        "question": "So I\u2019ve had three grand mal seizures so far, they happened once a year since 2017 and i went to see a doctor after the third time it happened. I was out with friends when suddenly i got a feeling like i was gonna throw up and the next thing i know i was lying on the ground with a deja vu feeling that i blacked out on a party. I did a MRI which came out normal and two EEGs, one sleep deprived, in which there was some abnormal activities on my left side of the brain. I came back to my neurologist with all the medical reports but he referred me to another neurologist because he wasn\u2019t specialised for epilepsy cases. The investigations have been now dragging on for a year so i started to do a bit of research on my own. I came across the temporal lobe epilepsy and suddenly everything made sense. When i was younger i had those strange feelings from time to time that every sound seemed aggressive and urgent, i got really annoyed by them and usually went to bed where the ceiling was strangely far away and my hands bigger. Anyways I always thought that this was normal stuff. Then I remembered about the times when i had unusual breakdowns when i was a kid, e.g. i refused to go to a place i was visiting every week, without a reasonable explanation. Also I\u2019ve been having deja vu\u2019s quite often e.g. i am scrolling through my phone when suddenly i know exactly what I\u2019m about to see next or have a deja vu about a dream. I also had my tonsils removed (right before my first seizure), because of mononucleosis and other infections. Does this makes any sense? Thanks for any advice",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're taking an active role in understanding your condition! Based on your description, it's possible that you may be experiencing symptoms related to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but it's essential to note that only a qualified neurologist can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nThe symptoms you've described, such as:\n\n1. **Strange feelings with sounds**: This could be related to auditory auras, which are a type of seizure that can occur in TLE.\n2. **Visual distortions (e.g., ceiling seeming far away, hands appearing bigger)**: These can be related to visual auras or seizures that affect the temporal lobe.\n3. **Unusual breakdowns as a kid**: This could be indicative of childhood seizures or episodes that were not recognized as such at the time.\n4. **Frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences**: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a common symptom in people with TLE, often reported as a feeling of familiarity or predictability.\n5. **Seizure triggers (e.g., feeling like you're going to throw up before a seizure)**: This could be an aura or a warning sign of an impending seizure.\n\nThe fact that you had your tonsils removed due to mononucleosis and other infections is interesting. Some research suggests that inflammation and infections, especially those affecting the brain or nervous system, can potentially trigger or contribute to the development of epilepsy.\n\nThe abnormal EEG activity on the left side of your brain, particularly when sleep-deprived, could be indicative of seizure activity or irritability in that region.\n\nGiven that your doctor has referred you to a specialized neurologist, it's essential to follow up with them and discuss your research and symptoms in more detail. Be sure to ask questions like:\n\n* What are the possible causes of my seizures?\n* Could I have temporal lobe epilepsy or another form of epilepsy?\n* What further tests or evaluations might be necessary to determine the underlying cause of my seizures?\n* Are there any specific treatments or therapies that might be recommended for my condition?\n\nIn the meantime, consider keeping a seizure diary to track any potential triggers, auras, or seizure activity. This can help your neurologist better understand your condition and make more informed decisions about your care.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you feel uncertain about your diagnosis or treatment plan."

        "question": "Hi! So basically, my question is already in my headline. I've got elevated eosinophil levels, my neurologist explained it as though my body is fighting a parasite, but without me having a parasite. I have an appointment with a hematologist in June, but I was wondering if anyone here could have an idea what this means. Age: 26 Sex: Female Height: 1m62/5'3\" Weight: 52kg/115lbs Race: Caucasian I don't have any complaints really, aside from being worried, but I'm already on a lot of medication for my epilepsy so I do have side effects from taking those, such as a tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, occasional dizziness (low blood pressure), having trouble falling asleep/having nightmares, loss of appetite... I'm currently on 250mg of Topamax, 2mg of Rivotril and 225mg of Venlafaxine. Thank you. Update: According to my doctor, normal eosinophil levels are up to 8%, mine are 22%. I have no allergies and I haven't been abroad.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll try to provide some general information and possible explanations for your elevated eosinophil levels. Please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and it's essential to consult with your hematologist in June for a thorough evaluation and personalized advice.\n\nElevated eosinophil levels, also known as eosinophilia, can occur in response to various conditions, including:\n\n1. **Parasitic infections**: As your neurologist mentioned, eosinophils can increase in response to parasitic infections. However, since you haven't been abroad and don't have any symptoms, this is less likely.\n2. **Allergic reactions**: Eosinophils can also increase in response to allergic reactions, such as asthma, eczema, or hay fever. However, you mentioned you don't have any allergies.\n3. **Autoimmune disorders**: Certain autoimmune conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or inflammatory bowel disease, can cause eosinophilia.\n4. **Hematological disorders**: Leukemias, lymphomas, or other blood disorders can lead to elevated eosinophil levels.\n5. **Medication-induced eosinophilia**: Some medications, including those you're taking (e.g., Topamax, Rivotril, and Venlafaxine), can cause eosinophilia as a side effect.\n6. **Idiopathic hypereosinophilia**: This is a condition where eosinophil levels are elevated without an identifiable cause.\n\nGiven your normal medical history, absence of allergies, and lack of international travel, it's possible that your elevated eosinophil levels might be related to:\n\n* **Medication side effects**: As mentioned earlier, some medications can cause eosinophilia. Your hematologist may investigate whether your current medications are contributing to your elevated eosinophil levels.\n* **Idiopathic hypereosinophilia**: This is a possibility, and your hematologist may need to rule out other underlying conditions to confirm this diagnosis.\n\nIt's essential to note that a 22% eosinophil level is significantly higher than the normal range (up to 8%), which may indicate a need for further investigation.\n\nIn preparation for your appointment with the hematologist, you may want to:\n\n* Write down a detailed list of your medications, including dosages and any changes you've made recently.\n* Keep a record of any symptoms, even if they seem unrelated to your eosinophil levels.\n* Ask your hematologist about potential causes and how they will be investigated.\n* Discuss any concerns or questions you have about your medications and potential interactions.\n\nRemember, this is not a diagnosis, and only a thorough evaluation by your hematologist can provide a more accurate understanding of your condition."

        "question": "I get a \"flash\" inside my head occasionally whenever I think of old things. Could this be some milder form of epilepsy?  The first time I remember this happening is when I was 16. I was looking at a Spider man mural from the 80s on the side of a building and when my mind tried to recreate the time period there my ears started ringing really loudly and suddenly, almost like a bang. The ringing faded and didn't last much longer than a second, but while it was happening I was a little out of it. It's hard to describe.It happened again last night at the grocery store while I was thinking about a sticker dispenser I'd just passed by and remembering seeing them during my early childhood. It hit me like a baseball bat as I was walking out of the door and I almost lost my balance. I'm not sure that I've ever had one that strong before, or maybe it just felt different because I was standing that time.This happens about once every week or month or so, and it has been for a long time. My doctor isn't interested in exploring it because it's never been a real impairment to my life, but I've always been curious about it.I guess something about the way my brain attempts to recreate the past sometimes (not always) triggers a \"cannot compute\" error. It's sort of specific, like when I'll try to place myself there and immerse myself in how I might have felt and experienced that time period, but it has pretty much only ever happened after seeing an older object or an old photo. My thoughts sort of just naturally flow into that sometimes so there's not really anything I can do about it, and I've never been able to recreate it intentionally.Male 27",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, so please take my response as speculation and not a diagnosis. It's great that you've been curious about this phenomenon, and I'll try to provide some possible insights.\n\nThe symptoms you described, such as the sudden, brief ringing in your ears, feeling \"out of it,\" and almost losing your balance, are intriguing. While it's possible that this could be related to epilepsy, it's also possible that it's a different condition or a benign phenomenon.\n\nHere are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **Temporal lobe phenomena**: The temporal lobe is involved in processing memories, emotions, and sensory information. Some people experience unusual sensations, such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, jamais vu, or brief, intense emotional responses, when their brain is processing familiar or nostalgic stimuli. Your experiences might be related to the temporal lobe's attempt to reconcile past and present.\n2. **Auditory phenomena**: The sudden, brief ringing in your ears could be related to a benign condition called **tinnitus** or **middle ear myoclonus**. However, the fact that it's triggered by nostalgia and only occurs occasionally makes this less likely.\n3. **Neurological \"glitches\"**: As you mentioned, it's possible that your brain is experiencing a \"cannot compute\" error when trying to process the past and present simultaneously. This might be related to the brain's attempt to reconcile conflicting information, leading to a brief, intense sensory response.\n4. **Sensory overload or pattern completion**: When you're exposed to nostalgic stimuli, your brain might be overwhelmed by the sudden influx of memories and emotions. This could lead to a brief, intense response, such as the ringing in your ears, as your brain tries to process and consolidate the information.\n5. **Benign paroxysmal phenomena**: There are several benign conditions, such as **benign paroxysmal positional vertigo** or **benign paroxysmal torticollis**, that can cause brief, intense episodes of dizziness, vertigo, or other sensations. While these conditions are usually related to specific triggers, it's possible that your experiences are a variant of one of these conditions.\n\nGiven your doctor's lack of interest in exploring this further, you might consider speaking with a neurologist or a psychologist who specializes in cognitive neuroscience or neuropsychology. They may be able to provide more insight into your experiences and help you better understand what's happening.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to keep a **symptom journal** to track when these episodes occur, what triggers them, and any other relevant factors. This could help you identify patterns and provide valuable information for any future medical consultations.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to discuss any concerns or symptoms with a qualified medical professional. If you experience any severe or worsening symptoms, such as intense headaches, difficulty speaking, or loss of consciousness, seek medical attention immediately."

        "question": "When I was about 2 years old I had epilepsy for some time due to a hard hit to my head. It's been 20+ years since I had an epileptic attack (I'm 26yrs old now). I don't even have memory about any of those episodes 'cause I was too young when that happened to me. Now I'm trying to get a job where I need to get shot with a stun gun as one of the tests. It worries me that somehow it will do some damage and bring back that condition to my life. Should I be worried?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "While it's natural to have concerns, I'll try to provide you with some reassurance and insights.\n\nFirstly, it's great to hear that you've been seizure-free for over 20 years. This is a significant period, and the likelihood of your epilepsy recurring is relatively low.\n\nRegarding the stun gun test, it's essential to understand that the effects of a stun gun on the brain are typically short-lived and not usually associated with long-term damage or the recurrence of epilepsy.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Stun guns and seizures:** There is limited research on the specific effects of stun guns on people with a history of epilepsy. However, studies suggest that the electrical discharge from a stun gun is unlikely to cause a seizure in someone who has been seizure-free for an extended period.\n2. **Neurological effects:** The electrical current from a stun gun can cause temporary neurological effects, such as muscle contractions, numbness, or tingling. These effects are usually short-lived and resolve on their own.\n3. **Epilepsy recurrence:** The likelihood of your epilepsy recurring due to a stun gun test is low. Epilepsy recurrence is often triggered by factors such as head trauma, infections, or certain medications, rather than a brief electrical shock.\n4. **Pre-existing conditions:** If you have any pre-existing medical conditions, including a history of epilepsy, it's crucial to inform the testing personnel and your doctor. They can assess the risks and take necessary precautions.\n\nTo put your mind at ease, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor:** Discuss your concerns with your primary care physician or a neurologist. They can evaluate your individual situation, review your medical history, and provide guidance on the potential risks.\n2. **Inform the testing personnel:** Let the testing organization know about your history of epilepsy. They may have protocols in place to ensure your safety during the test.\n3. **Assess the testing environment:** Make sure the testing environment is safe and equipped to handle any potential medical emergencies.\n\nWhile it's essential to take precautions, it's also important to remember that the stun gun test is a controlled environment, and the risks are likely to be minimal.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's always best to consult with a doctor or a neurologist for personalized advice. They can provide you with more specific guidance and help you make an informed decision.\n\nI hope this information helps alleviate some of your concerns.

I am here with two requests from the doctors here.I have looked a bit into the connections between inflammation and epilepsy I\u2019m looking for more information on this and would appreciate any thoughts / leads 2) I am also wondering if the cysts could be connected to inflammation",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're dealing with multiple chronic conditions. It's great that you're taking an proactive approach to understanding the potential connections between them. I'll do my best to provide you with some insights and leads on the relationships between inflammation, epilepsy, and cysts.\n\n**Inflammation and Epilepsy:**\n\nResearch suggests that there is a significant link between chronic inflammation and epilepsy. Inflammation can contribute to the development and progression of epilepsy in several ways:\n\n1. **Blood-brain barrier disruption**: Chronic inflammation can lead to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, allowing pro-inflammatory molecules to enter the brain and trigger seizures.\n2. **Neuroinflammation**: Inflammation in the brain can lead to the activation of immune cells, such as microglia, which can release pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to seizure activity.\n3. **Oxidative stress**: Chronic inflammation can lead to oxidative stress, which can damage brain tissue and increase the risk of seizures.\n4. **Gut-brain axis**: The gut and brain are connected through the vagus nerve, and alterations in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis) can contribute to inflammation and epilepsy.\n\nSome studies have specifically explored the connection between Crohn's disease and epilepsy. For example, a 2018 study published in the journal Epilepsy & Behavior found that patients with Crohn's disease were more likely to develop epilepsy compared to the general population.\n\n**Cysts and Inflammation:**\n\nCysts can be related to inflammation, although the exact relationship depends on the type and location of the cysts. Here are a few possible connections:\n\n1. **Ovarian cysts**: In women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), chronic inflammation is thought to contribute to the development of ovarian cysts.\n2. **Sebaceous cysts**: These skin cysts can become inflamed, leading to swelling, redness, and pain.\n3. **Ganglion cysts**: These cysts, which typically occur on the wrists or hands, can be related to joint inflammation or trauma.\n4. **Intracranial cysts**: Some studies suggest that inflammation may contribute to the development of intracranial cysts, such as arachnoid cysts.\n\nIn your case, it's possible that the cysts throughout your body could be related to chronic inflammation, especially given your history of Crohn's disease and other inflammatory conditions.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo further explore the connections between your conditions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Consult with your gastroenterologist and neurologist**: Discuss your research and concerns with your doctors, and ask if they have any insights into the potential relationships between your conditions.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Tracking your symptoms, including seizures, cyst-related issues, and inflammatory episodes, may help identify patterns or correlations.\n3. **Explore dietary and lifestyle changes**: Some studies suggest that dietary interventions, such as a keto or anti-inflammatory diet, may help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms.\n4. **Consider testing for biomarkers**: Your doctors may recommend testing for biomarkers of inflammation, such as CRP or IL-6, to monitor your inflammatory levels and adjust treatment plans accordingly.\n\nRemember, every individual's situation is unique, and it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to understand the specific relationships between your conditions and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm here to support you further if you have any more questions or concerns!"

It's great that you're taking an active role in understanding your treatment and considering multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe medication \"SELENICA-R 40%\" you mentioned is likely a formulation of valproate, an anticonvulsant commonly used to treat epilepsy and seizure disorders. While it's not typically prescribed for anxiety or depression, it can be used off-label for other conditions, such as mood stabilization or migraines.\r\n\r\nGiven your symptoms, it's possible that your doctor is considering a diagnosis of a neurological condition, such as a form of dystonia, essential tremor, or even a rare condition like Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). However, without a proper diagnosis, it's difficult to determine the appropriateness of this medication for your specific case.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that you discuss the following with your doctor:\r\n\r\n1. **Diagnosis**: What is the doctor's working diagnosis, and what are the underlying causes of your symptoms?\r\n2. **Medication rationale**: Why was SELENICA-R 40% chosen, and what are the expected benefits and potential side effects?\r\n3. **Alternative treatments**: Have other potential causes of your symptoms, such as a pinched nerve or bulged disc, been thoroughly ruled out?\r\n4. **Interactions with magnesium**: Are there any potential interactions between the high dose of magnesium you're taking and the new medication?\r\n\r\nIt's also essential to consult with a neurologist or a specialist who can provide a more in-depth evaluation of your symptoms and help determine the best course of treatment. They may recommend additional tests, such as an EMG (electromyogram) or nerve conduction studies, to further investigate your symptoms.\r\n\r\nRemember to keep a detailed record of your symptoms, medication, and medical history to share with your healthcare providers. This will help ensure that you receive the most accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a substitute for a medical professional.

        "answer": "I'd be happy to help you understand more about epilepsy.\n\n**What is epilepsy?**\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These seizures occur when there's an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain, which can cause changes in behavior, movement, or sensation. Epilepsy can be caused by various factors, including genetics, brain injury, infections, and certain medical conditions.\n\n**Can epilepsy occur without a reason?**\n\nYes, in some cases, epilepsy can occur without a known cause. This is called idiopathic epilepsy. Research suggests that some people may be born with a predisposition to develop epilepsy due to genetic factors, while others may develop it due to an unknown trigger. In some cases, a single seizure can occur without any underlying condition, and this is called a solitary seizure.\n\n**Family history and risk**\n\nHaving a family history of epilepsy, like your mom's cousin, does increase the risk of developing epilepsy. However, the risk is still relatively low. If your mom's cousin had epilepsy, it's possible that their children may be at a slightly higher risk, but it's not a guarantee that they will develop the condition. The risk of developing epilepsy due to family history is estimated to be around 2-5% if one first-degree relative (parent or sibling) has epilepsy.\n\n**Medications and epilepsy**\n\nCertain medications, including those used to treat depression and anxiety, can increase the risk of seizures in some individuals. However, this is relatively rare. Citalopram, the medication you mentioned, has a low risk of causing seizures, but it's not zero. The risk is higher in people with a pre-existing seizure disorder or those taking high doses of the medication.\n\nOther medications that can increase the risk of seizures include:\n\n* Certain antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, maprotiline)\n* Antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine)\n* Some antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, cefepime)\n* Certain pain medications (e.g., tramadol, meperidine)\n\n**Smoking and alcohol**\n\nAs you mentioned, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of developing epilepsy. Smoking has been linked to an increased risk of seizures, particularly in people with a history of head trauma or other neurological conditions. Excessive alcohol consumption can also lead to seizures, particularly in people with a history of alcohol withdrawal.\n\n**Your risk factors**\n\nAs a 24-year-old with a family history of epilepsy, your risk of developing epilepsy is still relatively low. However, it's essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including:\n\n* Not smoking\n* Limiting alcohol consumption\n* Managing stress\n* Getting regular exercise\n* Eating a balanced diet\n* Getting enough sleep\n\nIf you're concerned about your risk factors or have any questions, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional. They can assess your individual risk factors and provide personalized guidance.\n\nI hope this information helps you better understand epilepsy and your potential risk factors!"

        "question": "31 years Male USA Last year I went to a concert and during the show there was a bunch of flashing lights and it made me feel really \u201coff\u201d and I looked away. Tonight I was watching a TV show and there were some flashing scenes and it made me feel \u201coff\u201d again. So now, I\u2019m wondering if I somehow have epilepsy or something, even though I\u2019ve never had a seizure. I found this epilepsy \u201ctest\u201d video and forced myself to watch it on the big screen. I honestly felt uncomfortable and some \u201cimpending doom\u201d throughout, but I made it through the whole video without passing out. Is it possible I have epilepsy? Or is it normal for flashing to bother people without epilepsy? And is it possible I could be at risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching this video?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It's possible for anyone to be sensitive to flashing lights and feel uncomfortable in response. However, such sensitivity is more common and pronounced in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy, a rare condition where certain visual stimuli can trigger seizures. Photosensitive epilepsy is typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, but it can occur at any age.\n\nThe fact that you felt \"off\" during the concert and while watching a TV show with flashing scenes doesn't necessarily mean you have epilepsy. Many people without epilepsy can experience discomfort or nausea from certain visual stimuli, including flashing lights. This is often referred to as photosensitivity and doesn't imply the presence of epilepsy.\n\nAs for the epilepsy \"test\" video you watched, intentionally exposing yourself to such a video to see if you have epilepsy is not a recommended or reliable method for self-diagnosis. These videos are often created with specific patterns and frequencies of light and color that can trigger seizures in those with photosensitive epilepsy. While your reaction of feeling uncomfortable and experiencing a sense of \"impending doom\" indicates that you are sensitive to the flashing lights, it does not definitively indicate epilepsy.\n\nRegarding the risk of getting or becoming more susceptible to epilepsy after watching such a video, epilepsy is a neurological condition with genetic, structural, or metabolic causes. Simply watching an epilepsy \"test\" video does not cause epilepsy. If you are concerned about your sensitivity to flashing lights or have any other symptoms that worry you, the best course of action is to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a neurologist. They can provide a thorough evaluation, including any necessary tests, such as an EEG (electroencephalogram), to assess your risk for seizure disorders and offer appropriate advice and care."

        "question": " Hi, within the past 3 monthsish I have been experiencing these kinds of 'episodes'I will try my best at describing them..I start to feel dizzy, sometimes get a sharp pain in the corner of my eye for a split second, I then feel zoned out and have random memories and visions, deja vu etc, each deja vu memory going through my brain really really fast then on to another. Sometimes I get full blurred vision for a few seconds, I get slurred speech if I'm speaking,hot flushes, I have this weird feeling, like i'm going to be sick. As soon as it finishes i forget everytime i thought about which is why its so hard to explain. They last 1min-2min. Generally after I feel light headed and zoned out for the rest of the day, if someone speaks to me i probably wont even hear it.\\I went to the doctor about this, he suggested Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. So I got an MRI, but that all came back clear.My doctor told me to not worry about it, that it could be some kind of migraine or a form of small seizure. Unless it got worse, then to go back. Now yesterday I had three episodes in one day.My question is, should I be worried? And I really do have every single Temporal Lobe Epilepsy symptom, is there a way that the MRI couldn't catch that?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a medical professional, but I'll try to provide you with some general information and insights.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you're concerned about your symptoms, especially since they're recurring and affecting your daily life. Given your doctor's initial suggestion of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), it's natural to wonder if the MRI could have missed something.\n\n**Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and MRI:**\n\nWhile an MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool, it's not 100% foolproof. In some cases, TLE can be difficult to diagnose, and an MRI might not always show clear evidence of the condition. There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. **Focal lesions:** TLE can be caused by small, focal lesions in the temporal lobe, which might not be visible on a standard MRI.\n2. **Functional abnormalities:** TLE can also be caused by functional abnormalities, such as abnormal electrical activity, which may not be apparent on structural imaging like MRI.\n3. **Variant forms:** Some forms of TLE, like focal aware seizures or aura-only seizures, might not be associated with visible lesions on MRI.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that a clear MRI result does not entirely rule out TLE. If your doctor suspects TLE, they may recommend additional tests, such as:\n\n1. **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** To measure electrical activity in your brain and detect potential seizure activity.\n2. **Video EEG monitoring:** To record your brain activity during an episode, which can help diagnose TLE.\n3. **Other imaging modalities:** Such as functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans, which can provide more detailed information about brain function and activity.\n\n**Other potential causes:**\n\nWhile TLE is a possibility, other conditions could be contributing to your symptoms, such as:\n\n1. **Migraines:** As your doctor mentioned, migraines can cause similar symptoms, including visual aura, dizziness, and nausea.\n2. **Seizure-like episodes:** Conditions like syncope, vasovagal syncope, or non-epileptic seizure disorders (e.g., psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) might also be considered.\n3. **Other neurological or medical conditions:** Such as multiple sclerosis, vertigo, or cardiac issues, which could be causing your symptoms.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\nGiven the frequency and severity of your episodes, it's reasonable to seek further evaluation. Consider:\n\n1. **Schedule a follow-up appointment:** With your doctor to discuss the recent increase in episodes and your concerns.\n2. **Request additional testing:** Ask about the possibility of EEG, video EEG monitoring, or other imaging modalities to help diagnose or rule out TLE.\n3. **Keep a symptom journal:** Track your episodes, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers.\n4. **Seek a second opinion:** If you're not satisfied with your current doctor's assessment or want a more specialized opinion, consider consulting a neurologist or epileptologist.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be proactive and advocate for yourself. Don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor or seek additional medical attention if you experience any changes or worsening of your symptoms.\n\nPlease consult a medical professional for personalized advice and guidance. They will be able to assess your specific situation and provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll provide you with some general information and considerations. Please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and it's essential to consult your physician or a qualified healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n**Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine and neurological concerns:**\nThere have been reports of rare neurological conditions, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), associated with the J&J vaccine. GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. However, it's essential to note that:\n\n1. **The risk is extremely low**: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of GBS after J&J vaccination is about 1-2 cases per million doses administered.\n2. **The benefits outweigh the risks**: The J&J vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death.\n3. **Your epilepsy history**: While you have a history of mild epilepsy, there is no established link between epilepsy and an increased risk of GBS or other neurological disorders after vaccination.\n\n**AstraZeneca vaccine:**\nIf you have the option to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, consider the following:\n\n1. **Blood clotting concerns**: AstraZeneca has been associated with rare blood clotting disorders, such as thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. However, the risk is still very low (about 1-5 cases per million doses).\n2. **Efficacy and safety**: AstraZeneca has been shown to be effective in preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. The vaccine has a good safety profile, with rare serious side effects.\n\n**Your specific situation:**\nGiven your mild epilepsy history, it's understandable that you're concerned. However, the available data does not suggest a significant increased risk of neurological disorders or muscle paralysis after vaccination with either J&J or AstraZeneca.\n\nIf you have the chance to take AstraZeneca, it's likely a good option for you, considering the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, I strongly advise you to:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: As soon as possible, discuss your concerns and medical history with your doctor to determine the best course of action.\n2. **Weigh the risks and benefits**: Consider the risks and benefits of each vaccine, as well as your individual circumstances, to make an informed decision.\n3. **Follow local health guidelines**: Adhere to your local health authority's recommendations and guidelines regarding COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nRemember, vaccination is a crucial step in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting yourself and others. If you have any further concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider or a trusted medical professional."

Don\u2019t smoke and have nocturnal epilepsy (only have seizures in the middle of the night during sleep, often after sleep walking)So basically the doctor I always see has made it very clear that I shouldn\u2019t have more than 2 standard drinks in one night. However I was left feeling like there was more he could have said on the matter but didn\u2019t want to go into it.So when I was younger I set out with a plan to gradually increase the amount of alcohol I drink when I go out to see how I feel drinking more and to see if I can get away with drinking a bit more. This got to the point where I have felt fine every time and I now just drink as much as I feel like at the time.

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to provide a helpful response.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're taking proactive steps to understand your epilepsy and how it interacts with alcohol. Nocturnal epilepsy can be particularly challenging to manage, and it's essential to prioritize your health and safety.\n\nThe relationship between epilepsy and alcohol is complex, and there's no straightforward answer to your question. However, I'll try to provide some insights and considerations.\n\n**Alcohol and epilepsy: general guidelines**\n\nThe general recommendation for people with epilepsy is to limit or avoid alcohol consumption, as it can:\n\n1. Increase the risk of seizures, particularly during withdrawal or after heavy drinking.\n2. Interact with antiepileptic medications, such as clobazam and carbamazepine (Tegretol), which you're taking. This can lead to increased side effects, reduced efficacy, or increased risk of seizures.\n3. Disrupt sleep patterns, which can exacerbate nocturnal epilepsy.\n\nThe \"2 standard drinks\" limit your doctor recommended is a relatively conservative guideline, aiming to minimize the risks associated with alcohol consumption.\n\n**Individual variability**\n\nNow, to address your question: yes, some people with epilepsy may be able to drink moderate amounts of alcohol without experiencing adverse effects or increased seizure risk. However, this is highly individualized and depends on various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Type and severity of epilepsy**: Nocturnal epilepsy, like yours, may be more sensitive to alcohol's effects due to the potential for sleep disruption.\n2. **Medication regimen**: The type, dose, and combination of antiepileptic medications can influence the interaction with alcohol.\n3. **Personal tolerance**: Some people may be more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, while others may be more resilient.\n4. **Other health factors**: Overall health, liver function, and other medical conditions can impact how alcohol is metabolized and its effects on the body.\n\n**Have you been lucky?**\n\nIt's possible that you've been lucky so far, and your current drinking habits haven't triggered a seizure. However, it's essential to recognize that:\n\n1. **Correlation does not imply causation**: Just because you've not had a seizure after drinking, it doesn't mean that alcohol isn't increasing your risk.\n2. **Seizure triggers can be unpredictable**: Nocturnal epilepsy can be particularly unpredictable, and alcohol may still contribute to an increased risk, even if you haven't experienced a seizure yet.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nConsidering your situation, I would advise you to:\n\n1. **Revisit your doctor**: Discuss your concerns and drinking habits with your doctor, and ask for a more detailed explanation of the potential risks and benefits. They may be able to provide more personalized guidance or refer you to a specialist.\n2. **Keep a seizure diary**: Record your seizures, including any potential triggers, such as alcohol consumption. This can help you and your doctor better understand your epilepsy and identify patterns.\n3. **Consider reducing your drinking**: As a precaution, you may want to reduce your drinking to a level that's more in line with your doctor's original recommendation (2 standard drinks). This can help minimize potential risks and ensure your safety.\n4. **Explore alternative social activities**: If you enjoy socializing, consider finding activities that don't involve heavy drinking, such as sports, hobbies, or events that don't center around alcohol.\n\nRemember, it's always better to prioritize your health and safety when it comes to epilepsy and alcohol consumption. By being open with your doctor and taking a cautious approach, you can minimize risks and ensure the best possible management of your condition.\n\nI hope this response helps you better understand the situation and make informed decisions about your drinking habits."

Thanks!Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis for excessive sweating?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Iontophoresis is a medical treatment that uses a device to deliver a mild electrical current to the affected areas, which can help reduce excessive sweating. However, as you've read, there are some precautions and potential contraindications, including epilepsy.\n\n**Epilepsy and Iontophoresis: What's the concern?**\n\nThe primary concern is that the electrical current used in Iontophoresis may potentially trigger seizures in people with epilepsy, particularly those with a history of photosensitive or reflex epilepsy. The rhythmic electrical impulses could, in theory, stimulate the brain and cause a seizure.\n\n**Can someone with epilepsy use Iontophoresis?**\n\nWhile there's a potential risk, it's not an absolute contraindication. Some people with epilepsy may still be able to undergo Iontophoresis treatment, but with certain precautions:\n\n1. **Consult your neurologist**: Before starting Iontophoresis, it's essential to discuss the potential risks with your neurologist. They can assess your individual situation, review your medical history, and provide guidance on whether Iontophoresis is suitable for you.\n2. **Adjust treatment parameters**: Your healthcare provider may adjust the treatment settings, such as the intensity and frequency of the electrical current, to minimize the risk of seizure triggers.\n3. **Monitor for seizure activity**: During the treatment, your healthcare provider may monitor you for signs of seizure activity, such as EEG (electroencephalogram) monitoring.\n4. **Alternative treatment options**: If your neurologist advises against Iontophoresis, they may recommend alternative treatments for excessive sweating, such as botulinum toxin injections, oral medications, or other therapies.\n\n**Additional tips**\n\nIf you're considering Iontophoresis for excessive sweating and have epilepsy, keep the following in mind:\n\n* Be open and honest with your healthcare provider about your medical history, including your epilepsy diagnosis and any medications you're taking.\n* Discuss any concerns or questions you have about the treatment and its potential risks.\n* Follow your healthcare provider's guidance and recommendations regarding the treatment and any necessary precautions.\n\nI hope this information helps!

        "question": " I've been epileptic since i was 14, and i'm concerned about whether this condition increases risk of brain related diseases as i get older.I'm part of the lucky ones, as i have treatment, and don't suffer any full blown seizures normally. My doctor told me that my epilepsy type is one that makes up 12.5 % of all epiletics, which we don't know how it functions. There's an anomaly in my brain, and we know how to treat it, but we don't know why.I've suffered 4 of these total, the first time when i didn't know, obviously. Second time 3 weeks later when i got off my meds when doctors wanted to know if it was a one time thing or not, third time the very next day when i hadn't been back on my meds yet.Then 8 years passed, and i lived with it. I occasionally got part seizures that got me to figure out the 3 things i need for a real one not to occur : get sleep, not skip more than twice on my meds, not get stressed. I can get away with missing one of these requirements, i get part seizures if i miss 2, which whips me right back on track. But last year, i had my fourth seizure.This one was a lot harder than my first ones. I used to get my memory jumbled, which would enventually return. This time i forgot entirely what happened for the full day, my last memory was setting my alarm and seeing i would only have 6h30 of sleep instead of 8. So that's definitely 1 out of 3. I guess i forgot to take my meds in the morning and got a stressful day. I still don't know what happened that day, just that it happened while riding back home on my bike.I thought i'd ask my brain doctor about a lot of things on our following check up, but he rushed our meeting, and straight up told me not to ask so many questions.

        "answer": "I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to understand your condition and its potential implications on your brain health.\n\nEpilepsy and its relationship with brain-related diseases is a complex topic. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, research suggests that epilepsy may increase the risk of certain brain-related conditions, particularly in older age. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Epilepsy and neurodegeneration**: Studies suggest that epilepsy, especially if left uncontrolled or poorly managed, may contribute to neurodegenerative processes, such as neuronal loss, inflammation, and altered brain connectivity. This could potentially increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or frontotemporal dementia.\n2. **Seizure frequency and severity**: The frequency and severity of seizures can impact brain health. Frequent or severe seizures may lead to cumulative damage, increasing the risk of cognitive decline, memory problems, and other brain-related issues.\n3. **Part seizures (auras) and subclinical seizures**: Part seizures, also known as auras, are brief, subtle seizures that may not be immediately noticeable. Subclinical seizures, which are seizures that don't cause noticeable symptoms, can also occur. While these types of seizures may not be as dramatic as full-blown seizures, they can still affect brain function and potentially contribute to cumulative damage.\n4. **Brain plasticity and adaptation**: The brain has a remarkable ability to adapt and compensate for damage or dysfunction. However, repeated seizures can disrupt this process, leading to maladaptive changes that may increase the risk of brain-related diseases.\n\nTo answer your questions directly:\n\n* **Does epilepsy increase brain-related diseases with time?**: Yes, epilepsy may increase the risk of certain brain-related diseases, particularly in older age. However, this risk can be mitigated with proper management, treatment, and lifestyle modifications.\n* **Are seizures and part seizures bad for the brain and should be avoided at all cost?**: Seizures, including part seizures, can potentially contribute to cumulative damage and increase the risk of brain-related issues. While it's not possible to completely eliminate seizures, managing them effectively with medication, lifestyle changes, and other therapies can help minimize their impact on brain health.\n\nIt's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to optimize your treatment plan and address any concerns you may have. Given your experience with seizures and your desire to understand your condition better, it's understandable that you want to ask questions and discuss your concerns with your doctor.\n\nWhen you finally have your rescheduled appointment, consider preparing a list of questions and topics you'd like to discuss, such as:\n\n* The potential risks and benefits of your current treatment plan\n* Strategies to minimize seizure frequency and severity\n* Ways to manage stress, sleep, and medication adherence to reduce seizure risk\n* The relationship between your epilepsy type and potential brain-related diseases\n* Any concerns or questions you have about your specific condition and treatment\n\nRemember, it's your right as a patient to ask questions and seek clarification on your condition and treatment. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek a second opinion if you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed."

So I\u2019m wondering if these things are somewhat normal and people without epilepsy have them? Or if this is indicative of absent seizures and epilepsy.I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I\u2019m wondering how often it is to have no diagnoses of epilepsy for 31+ years and never having a serious seizure...but having epilepsy. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.Thanks",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general insights and potential explanations. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional, especially a neurologist, for a personalized evaluation and advice.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing, such as staring spells, feeling spaced out, and not paying attention, can be common in people without epilepsy. Many individuals experience mind-wandering or daydreaming, which can manifest as staring spells or feeling disconnected from their surroundings. These episodes can be brief, lasting from a few seconds to minutes, and are often harmless.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these symptoms could be related to epilepsy, specifically absence seizures (also known as petit mal seizures). Absence seizures are characterized by brief, sudden lapses in consciousness, often accompanied by staring, eye fluttering, or other automatisms. These seizures can be subtle and may not always be immediately noticeable.\n\nGiven your age and the fact that you've never been diagnosed with epilepsy, it's possible that you may have been experiencing undiagnosed absence seizures. Absence seizures can be difficult to diagnose, especially if they are infrequent or mild.\n\nSome factors to consider:\n\n1. **Frequency and duration**: You mentioned that your staring spells typically last between 15-30 seconds. This is within the range of absence seizures, which can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.\n2. **Triggering factors**: You mentioned flashing lights as a potential trigger. Photosensitive epilepsy is a type of epilepsy that can be triggered by visual stimuli, such as flashing lights.\n3. **Age of onset**: While epilepsy can develop at any age, it's more common for absence seizures to begin in childhood or adolescence. However, it's not impossible for them to start in adulthood.\n4. **Family history**: Do you have any family members with a history of epilepsy or seizures?\n\nThe sleep-deprived EEG you're scheduled for can help your doctor assess your brain activity and determine if you're experiencing any abnormal electrical discharges that could be indicative of epilepsy.\n\nTo better understand your symptoms, you may want to keep a seizure diary or log to track when these episodes occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers or patterns you notice. This can be helpful to discuss with your doctor during your upcoming appointment.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions. Your doctor will be able to assess your symptoms, medical history, and test results to provide a more informed diagnosis and guidance.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!"

I decided to go to the doctor bc for about 3 weeks I\u2019ve been extremely thirsty, waking up in the night repeatedly to get water despite drinking tons etc. As my mother has type 1 diabetes she told me to make an appointment Doc mentioned diabetes which thankfully none of the results support!They\u2019ve called back (the gp surgery) to say I have low folate and low ferritin and to make an appointment. They sent over the results which include:VITAMIN B12 Serum vitamin B12 level 398.0 ng/L [211.0 - 911.0]FOLATE (SERUM) Serum folate level 3.89 ug/L [> 5.38] Below low reference limitFERRITIN Serum C reactive protein level < 4 mg/L [0.0 - 6.0] Serum ferritin level 14.2 ug/L [10.0 - 291.0]I had a quick google because I have epilepsy and wanted to know before e appointment if I should ask about contacting my neuro or if it could affect my epilepsy etc. However when I looked I was confused - I can see that someone can have both folate deficiency and, say, iron deficiency with a poor diet, but I always thought my diet was fine? Are there any other ways they can be connected? Obv not huge as hopefully I\u2019ll find out but I\u2019m curious. And could this affect my epilepsy in any way?Possible relevant info: My periods are light, regular and if I take painkillers then I don\u2019t have any pain. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s controlled by Keppra/leviteracetam, which I always take. No other meds. I know anti convulsants can affect ferritin levels etc but it seems to be \u201canti convulsants except keppra\u201d usually!I exercise a little - 30 minutes of yoga, walk th\u00e9 dog twice a day, I am in a place where I can walk everywhere to get around. I eat chicken, pork, fish, liver regularly (I have meat basically every day except\u00e9 1 to 2 days per week ), I drink milk fairly regularly, rarely have eggs, always have my 7 a day (I think in America the recommendation is 5 but here it is 7 - mostly from veg e.g broccoli, carrots, squash, spinach, cauliflower, kale, but I also like apples, oranges, satsumas, grapes etc all the time).",

        "answer": "I'm happy to help you understand your lab results and potential connections between folate and ferritin deficiencies.\n\n**Folate and Ferritin Deficiencies:**\n\nWhile a poor diet can contribute to both folate and ferritin deficiencies, there are other possible explanations:\n\n1. **Malabsorption:** Even with a balanced diet, your body might not be absorbing these nutrients properly. This can be due to various factors, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or other gastrointestinal issues.\n2. **Genetic predisposition:** Some people may have genetic variations that affect their ability to absorb or process folate and iron.\n3. **Hormonal influences:** Hormonal changes, such as those experienced during menstruation, can impact iron levels. Your light periods might be a contributing factor to your low ferritin levels.\n4. **Chronic inflammation:** Low-grade chronic inflammation, which can be measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, can lead to decreased iron levels. However, your CRP level is within the normal range.\n5. **Medication interactions:** Although you mentioned that Keppra is not typically associated with affecting ferritin levels, it's still possible that your epilepsy medication could be influencing your nutrient absorption or metabolism.\n\n**Connection between Folate and Ferritin Deficiencies:**\n\nFolate and iron are interconnected in the body. Folate helps regulate the production of red blood cells, which require iron to function properly. A deficiency in either nutrient can lead to similar symptoms, such as fatigue and pale skin.\n\n**Impact on Epilepsy:**\n\nWhile there is no direct link between folate or ferritin deficiencies and epilepsy, it's essential to consider the potential effects of these deficiencies on your overall health and seizure control:\n\n1. **Fatigue:** Severe fatigue can increase the risk of seizures, as it can affect your brain's ability to regulate electrical activity.\n2. **Nutrient deficiencies:** Chronic deficiencies in essential nutrients like folate and iron can impact brain function and potentially affect seizure control.\n3. **Medication interactions:** If you're experiencing malabsorption or other issues affecting your nutrient levels, it may impact the effectiveness of your epilepsy medication.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nBefore your appointment, consider the following:\n\n1. **Ask about malabsorption:** Discuss the possibility of malabsorption with your doctor and ask if any further tests are needed to rule out underlying conditions.\n2. **Dietary assessment:** Review your diet with your doctor to ensure you're getting enough folate and iron from food sources.\n3. **Supplementation:** Your doctor may recommend supplements to address your deficiencies.\n4. **Epilepsy monitoring:** Inform your doctor about your epilepsy and ask if they recommend consulting with your neurologist to discuss potential implications of these deficiencies on your seizure control.\n5. **Follow-up tests:** Schedule follow-up tests to monitor your folate and ferritin levels after addressing the deficiencies.\n\nRemember, it's essential to discuss your specific situation and results with your doctor to determine the best course of action. They will help you understand the underlying causes of your deficiencies and develop a plan to address them."

        "question": "9 year old (M) had his first seizure. He is 4 ft 5 inches. 37.5 kgs. No medical issues. We went into a state of panic because we never thought it could happen to us. We took him to ER. They did CT scan and found no masses or lesions etc. Usually they wait for a second event to diagnose as epilepsy but they did EEG and said it was abnormal....so based on it they concluded it is primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic clonic seizures??) and decided they dont need to do MRI or anything like that. He was prescribed Depakote ER 250 mg twice a day. After a month, he is supposed to have a longer video EEG done.We asked the Dr a bunch of questions and they were helpful in answering. But I read about Depakote and it seems like a rough one. Some questions -    How come he had abnormal EEG hours after the event? Does he always have that sort of EEG?    Could this abnormal EEG have affected his growth and mental development?    Should we worry about underlying cause? And get an MRI done to look for scarring?    Realistically, what is the quality of life for my son on Depakote? Behavior changes, hairloss, liver toxicity? I am asking for real experience...not the side effects page on WebMD.    I am not a hippie but can we avoid taking Depakote and other anti-convulsive drugs? Instead give him CBD etc?    Should we get a second or a 3rd opinion? Should we get another EEG or just show that EEG to other neurologists?Thanks in advance!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to address your questions and concerns.\n\n**Abnormal EEG after the event:**\nAn abnormal EEG after a seizure is not uncommon. The brain may still be recovering from the seizure, and the EEG can detect abnormalities in brain activity, such as slowing or spike-wave discharges, which can indicate an increased risk of seizure recurrence. This doesn't necessarily mean that your son always has an abnormal EEG. The EEG can be influenced by various factors, including the seizure itself, medication, and even the child's state of mind (e.g., stress, anxiety).\n\n**Impact on growth and mental development:**\nThere is no clear evidence that an abnormal EEG or primary generalized epilepsy (with tonic-clonic seizures) directly affects growth or mental development. However, uncontrolled seizures can potentially impact cognitive and behavioral development. Effective management of seizures with medication, such as Depakote, can help mitigate these risks.\n\n**Underlying cause and MRI:**\nWhile the CT scan was normal, it's understandable to wonder about underlying causes. In some cases, an MRI can reveal subtle abnormalities, such as scarring, malformations, or tumors, that might not be visible on a CT scan. If you're concerned, you can discuss the possibility of an MRI with your child's neurologist. However, it's essential to weigh the benefits and risks of additional imaging, as well as the potential impact on your child's anxiety and stress levels.\n\n**Quality of life on Depakote:**\nDepakote can be an effective medication for controlling seizures, but it's true that it can have side effects. Realistically, some children may experience:\n\n* Behavioral changes (e.g., irritability, mood swings): common, but often manageable with dose adjustments or behavioral interventions.\n* Hair loss: relatively rare, but can occur.\n* Liver toxicity: rare, but monitoring liver function tests can help detect any potential issues early on.\n\nTo minimize side effects, it's crucial to work closely with your child's neurologist to find the optimal dose and monitor for any adverse effects.\n\n**Alternative treatments (CBD, etc.):**\nWhile CBD and other alternative treatments have gained attention for their potential anticonvulsant properties, they are not yet widely accepted as first-line treatments for epilepsy. The American Academy of Neurology and the Epilepsy Foundation recommend that CBD be used only under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as part of a clinical trial or with careful monitoring. Depakote and other established antiepileptic medications have a more extensive evidence base and are generally considered safer and more effective.\n\n**Second or third opinion:**\nSeeking a second or third opinion can be beneficial, especially if you have concerns or questions about your child's diagnosis or treatment. You can:\n\n* Share the EEG report and medical history with other neurologists to get their input.\n* Discuss your concerns and questions with the new neurologist, including the possibility of alternative treatments or additional testing.\n\nBefore seeking another opinion, consider the following:\n\n* Are you looking for a specialist in pediatric epilepsy or a specific aspect of epilepsy care?\n* Are you seeking a fresh perspective on your child's diagnosis or treatment?\n* Are you concerned about the potential risks or side effects of Depakote?\n\n**Additional EEG:**\nIf you decide to seek a second opinion, the new neurologist may want to perform another EEG to confirm the diagnosis or monitor your child's response to treatment. This can be a good opportunity to ask questions and clarify any concerns you may have.\n\nIn conclusion, it's essential to work closely with your child's neurologist to monitor their condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you have concerns or questions. Remember to weigh the benefits and risks of any treatment or testing, and prioritize your child's overall well-being and quality of life."

Today I\u2019m still feeling crappy but I\u2019m back at work at my hospital.Does this sound like a seizure?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some insights based on your description. However, please keep in mind that only a qualified medical professional can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nYour experience sounds like it could be related to a seizure, given your history of epilepsy. The \"aura\" or \"deja vu\" feeling you described is a common precursor to seizures, often referred to as a prodrome. The episode you described, where you were unable to move, open your eyes, or speak for 20 seconds, with amplified sound and a vibrating sensation, could be consistent with a seizure.\n\nThere are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Complex partial seizure**: This type of seizure can cause a range of symptoms, including altered awareness, loss of motor control, and sensory changes (like the vibrating sensation). It's possible that you experienced a complex partial seizure, which might not have been accompanied by convulsions.\n2. **Simple partial seizure**: This type of seizure can cause localized symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or unusual sensations, without affecting consciousness. Your experience could be consistent with a simple partial seizure affecting your motor control and sensory perception.\n3. **Other possibilities**: It's also possible that you experienced a non-epileptic seizure, such as a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES), which can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or other factors.\n\nGiven your history of epilepsy and the symptoms you described, it's essential to discuss this episode with your doctor or neurologist. They will likely want to:\n\n* Review your medical history and current medication regimen\n* Discuss any potential triggers or contributing factors (e.g., caffeine, stress, sleep deprivation)\n* Possibly order additional tests, such as an EEG, to assess your brain activity\n* Adjust your treatment plan if necessary\n\nIn the meantime, it's crucial to prioritize your health and safety:\n\n* Avoid any activities that could put you or others at risk (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery)\n* Try to manage your stress and anxiety levels\n* Get plenty of rest and maintain a consistent sleep schedule\n* Keep a seizure diary to track any future episodes and potential triggers\n\nPlease consult with your doctor or neurologist as soon as possible to discuss your experience and determine the best course of action."

        "question": "So I was in a car accident back in October as I had a seizure that resulted in me blacking out as I was driving. I have had seizures since I was 15 years old, but I have never been officially diagnosed until recently. My seizures, also what we believe (I have not seen a neurologist yet) is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, consist of 2-3 minutes of dissociation, aura like feelings, deja vu, and taste/hearing/sight delusions. (https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/temporal-lobe-epilepsy-aka-tle)... After the seizure is finished, I can go back to doing my normal day-to-day activities, but sometimes they throw my day off, all depends on other circumstances. I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) 100 mg / 2x daily for about 3 months now and it has been doing wonders. I have not had a seizure since October which is something I thought I could never say. The only reason I have not seen a neurologist is because of lack of health insurance, but I am hoping to see one sometime next year once I can afford to do so. Anyways, back to my presenting problem. I was only going 25-30 mph down a semi-busy street and I crashed into a metal barrier at a store front. I do not remember blacking out. I remember waking up in the ambulance completely restrained and being extremely scared, screaming and yelling at the EMTs because I thought I was in a nightmare/horror scene! Then I must have been sedated a bit and the next thing I remember was being pulled through on a gurney into the ER. For a while I have been experiencing a lot of sharp pain in my left side / lower rib cage area. At first, I thought it was a potential growth/tumor, so I went to my local clinic and had a doctor feel me up to check for anything. She did not feel any lumps or growths, but she did press on my ribs and that gave me a lot of pain. We suspected that maybe when I was in the accident, something with my seat belt, wheel, or airbag could have hit my side so hard that it caused some contusions or internal bruising. My skin isn't red and there isn't any noticeable swelling on my skin. I just feel a constant pressure around my heart and my left lung which really concerns me as that part of my body is the most precious. I wonder if I bruised my lung, have pleurisy? She prescribed me some anti-inflammatory steroids for 5 days to reduce some swelling, so hopefully that helps. I have also been wearing a lot of menthol patches and using analgesic cream to relieve the pain. Just curious if anyone has any more insight into my problems as I don't have the resources to see a doctor right now or get an x-ray.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about your car accident and the challenges you're facing with your health and lack of insurance. It's great to hear that the Topiramate has been effective in managing your seizures.\n\nRegarding your current symptoms, it's understandable that you're concerned about the sharp pain in your left side and lower rib cage area. Given the history of the accident, it's possible that you may have suffered a rib contusion or bruising, which can cause pain and discomfort. The fact that the doctor didn't find any lumps or growths is reassuring, but it's still important to consider other potential causes.\n\nPleurisy, which is inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs, is a possibility, especially if you experienced a severe impact to your chest area during the accident. However, without a physical examination, imaging tests (such as an X-ray or CT scan), or medical evaluation, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of your symptoms.\n\nSome potential causes of your symptoms could include:\n\n1. **Rib contusion or fracture**: The impact from the accident could have caused a bruise or fracture to your ribs, leading to pain and discomfort.\n2. **Pleurisy**: As mentioned earlier, inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs could be causing your symptoms.\n3. **Costochondritis**: This is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone, which can cause sharp pains in the chest and rib area.\n4. **Muscle strain**: The accident could have caused muscle strain or pulling in your chest or rib area, leading to pain and discomfort.\n5. **Internal bruising**: It's possible that you may have internal bruising or bleeding in your chest or abdominal area, which could be causing your symptoms.\n\nIt's essential to note that while the anti-inflammatory steroids and pain relief measures may help alleviate your symptoms, they may not address the underlying cause of your pain. If your symptoms worsen or persist, it's crucial to seek medical attention as soon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to consider the following:\n\n1. **Monitor your symptoms**: Keep track of your pain levels, any changes in your symptoms, and any factors that exacerbate or relieve your pain.\n2. **Apply heat or cold**: Applying heat or cold packs to the affected area may help alleviate your pain and discomfort.\n3. **Take deep breaths**: Practice deep breathing exercises to help manage your pain and reduce stress.\n4. **Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities**: Avoid activities that may exacerbate your symptoms or put additional strain on your chest and rib area.\n\nOnce you have access to medical care, it's essential to have a thorough evaluation, including imaging tests and a physical examination, to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.

        "question": "Girlfriend 20 y.o approx 55kg. Located Sydney, Australia. Jan 2017 my girlfriend had 39.7deg C fevers lasting approx 1 week. She was found in bed unresponsive, with side to side head movements. (One of my questions is what was this? Status epilepticus?) She was taken to ER and then into ICU with uncontrolled seizures, and not recovering inbetween episodes, & put into an induced coma. She was put on phenytoin initially, and I believe levetriacetam and sodium valproate followed shortly thereafter. My guess is also Midaz during the episodes. Her longest seizure (tonic-clonic) lasted 8 and a half minutes. Many tests later, abnormal EEG looking like the seizures were coming from left temporal lobe (her eyes/head get pushed to the right). Unremarkable MRI, all x-rays good. 2x spinal tap as the thoughts were auto-immune encephalitis (results: no evidence to support this aside from ancedotal). Little to no memories from 6 months ago with patchy memory for the last 2 years Discharged from ICU and we were back the next day as she was having more seizures. Was receiving prednisone and had 5 days IVIG for brain immflamation. A day later we were back in the ward, we would eventually be discharged about 3.5 weeks after initial admission. No seizures following the 1.5 months after discharge, but then they came back frequently. Her current seizures are not tonic clonic. She is concious throughout, still body though head, mouth and eyes behave just like a tonic clonic for someone with TLE. Lasting 30 secs to a min most of the time. Frequency is ~2x per week, nocturnal. I do have videos of the seizures. AEDs are: Phenytoin 300mg Levetriacetam (Keppra brand) 2500mg Sodium Valporate 2400mg Looking at introducing Vimpat shortly. My main questions: Was her head to head movement seizure activity? I know she was in status epilepticus/ prolonged seizure activity in ICU/ER. What are your thoughts on what she had? What are your thoughts on the current medication?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to provide a detailed and informed response to your questions.\n\n**Initial Episode (Jan 2017)**\n\nThe side-to-side head movements you described, in combination with unresponsiveness, could be indicative of seizure activity, particularly **lateral deviation of the eyes** (also known as \"versive seizures\") which is a type of seizure that can occur in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This is consistent with the abnormal EEG findings, which suggested seizure activity originating from the left temporal lobe. The fact that her eyes/head were pushed to the right suggests that the seizure activity might have been originating from the left hemisphere of the brain.\n\nStatus epilepticus is a medical emergency characterized by prolonged seizure activity (lasting more than 5 minutes) or repeated seizures without full recovery between episodes. Given the severe and prolonged nature of her seizures, it's likely that she was indeed in status epilepticus.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nThe extensive testing, including MRI, X-rays, and spinal taps, helped rule out other potential causes of her seizures, such as infections or autoimmune disorders. The abnormal EEG and clinical presentation suggested focal epilepsy, specifically TLE.\n\nThe initial treatment with phenytoin, levetiracetam, and sodium valproate is a common and effective combination for managing seizures. The addition of midazolam (Midaz) during seizures is also a standard practice to help terminate the seizure activity.\n\nThe use of prednisone and IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) suggests that the medical team was considering an autoimmune or inflammatory component to her condition, although the spinal tap results did not support this.\n\n**Current Seizures and Medication**\n\nHer current seizures, which are not tonic-clonic and occur while she is conscious, are likely **focal aware seizures** (also known as \"auras\" or \"simple partial seizures\"). These seizures can manifest as abnormal movements or sensations, such as those you described (head, mouth, and eyes behaving like a tonic-clonic seizure).\n\nThe frequency and nocturnal pattern of her seizures suggest that they may be related to her sleep-wake cycle.\n\nThe current medication regimen, consisting of phenytoin, levetiracetam, and sodium valproate, is a relatively high dose and combination of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The plan to introduce lacosamide (Vimpat) is likely aimed at trying to better control her seizures.\n\n**Thoughts on Medication**\n\nThe medication regimen appears to be quite aggressive, which may be necessary given the severity and frequency of her seizures. However, it's essential to monitor for potential side effects, such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, or other adverse effects, especially with the high doses of AEDs.\n\nThe introduction of lacosamide (Vimpat) may help improve seizure control, but it's crucial to closely monitor its efficacy and potential interactions with her existing medications.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. **Continue to work closely with her neurologist** to optimize her medication regimen and monitor for potential side effects.\n2. **Keep a seizure diary** to track the frequency, duration, and characteristics of her seizures, which can help identify patterns and inform treatment decisions.\n3. **Consider a referral to an epilepsy specialist** or a comprehensive epilepsy center for further evaluation and guidance on managing her condition.\n4. **Explore the possibility of alternative treatments**, such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or other therapies, if her seizures remain uncontrolled despite optimal medical management.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex case, and it's essential to consult with her neurologist and other healthcare professionals for personalized advice and guidance."

        "question": "Hi there! I recently found out that what I thought was just passing out 2 times were actually seizures. These happened a couple years apart, once in high school and once in college. They were both triggered by kinda similar events but both were from physical sensations. I experienced the aura, ictal and post-ictal phases of a seizure based on the research I have done over the past couple days. All of the feelings that I experienced afterwards line up with the symptoms post-seizure (including even some very strong spiritual connections (which can be associated with epilepsy).The first time I seized was when I got hit with a baseball in high school and was fine until I went to go sit back on the bench and then all the sudden I was like huh, something isn't right. Then next thing I know I wake up to 3 different adults standing over me holding my harms and keeping them from shaking. Luckily when I fell off the bench I fell onto catchers gear on instead of concrete. Then the next time was in college while a friend tried to pierce my ears. I again felt that same aura and began seizing. This time my partner was there and caught me from falling off my chair.I only realized recently that these were seizures after talking to my partner's mom who is a healthcare provider. As I was talking about epilepsy in one of my classes, I was suddenly inspired to look it up and find out more. Is it possible that I have a mild case of it? Should I go get tested? What are the implications for if I do? From the research I have done, it takes at least 2 seizures to get diagnosed so technically I have experienced that but years apart. Should I be worried about this or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I just don't know what to do.",

        "answer": "I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to understand what might be going on with your health! It's great that you've been doing research and reaching out for guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist, to discuss your experiences and determine if you might have epilepsy. While it's possible that you could have a mild case, only a medical professional can provide an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe fact that you've had two seizures, albeit years apart, triggered by physical sensations, and experienced the aura, ictal, and post-ictal phases, suggests that there might be an underlying condition. The symptoms you've described, including the strong spiritual connections, are also consistent with some types of epilepsy.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, it's possible that you have a mild case of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a spectrum disorder, and some people may experience infrequent or mild seizures. However, it's crucial to have a thorough evaluation to determine the severity and type of epilepsy, if present.\n\nRegarding the implications, if you're diagnosed with epilepsy, it may affect various aspects of your life, such as:\n\n1. **Medication**: You might need to take anti-seizure medications to manage your condition.\n2. **Lifestyle adjustments**: You may need to make changes to your daily routine, such as avoiding certain activities or situations that could trigger seizures.\n3. **Driving**: Depending on the frequency and severity of your seizures, you might face restrictions on driving.\n4. **Work and education**: You may need to disclose your condition to your employer or educational institution, which could impact your career or academic pursuits.\n5. **Social and emotional well-being**: Living with epilepsy can be stressful and affect your mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\nHowever, with proper diagnosis, treatment, and management, many people with epilepsy lead active, fulfilling lives.\n\nIt's not likely that you're making a big deal out of nothing. Seizures can be a sign of an underlying condition, and it's better to be safe than sorry. Even if you're not diagnosed with epilepsy, your healthcare provider can help you identify potential underlying causes and provide guidance on how to manage your symptoms.\n\nTo move forward, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Schedule an appointment**: Book a consultation with a neurologist or a primary care physician to discuss your experiences.\n2. **Keep a seizure diary**: Start documenting any potential seizure activity, including the date, time, triggers, and symptoms.\n3. **Gather information**: Share your research and symptoms with your healthcare provider to help them better understand your situation.\n4. **Be prepared for tests**: Your healthcare provider may recommend tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scan to help diagnose your condition.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. By seeking medical attention and guidance, you'll be taking the first step towards understanding and managing your condition.\n\nHow do you feel about scheduling an appointment and discussing your symptoms with a healthcare provider? Is there anything specific that's worrying you or any questions you have about the process?"

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question. My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures. My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Drugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 500mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed. Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety. These medications may change a bit, but the general amount will stay the same. If anyone could give me insight on this topic please tell me. As I am a shy person and bringing this up with my neurologist would only complicate my appointments with him. So I\u2019d rather learn more prior to bringing it up. You can be specific in medications, dosages and terminology as I do know a lot about epilepsy and studying neurology currently.",

        "answer": "I'm glad you reached out for information before discussing this with your neurologist. I'll provide you with some insights on the potential interactions between your current medications, particularly Depakote and Keppra, and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Please note that this is not a substitute for a medical consultation, and it's essential to discuss this with your neurologist before starting HRT.\n\n**Depakote (Valproate) and HRT:**\nDepakote is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) enhancer, which can influence the metabolism of certain hormones, including estrogen. HRT typically involves estrogen and progesterone supplementation. The concern is that estrogen can induce an increase in the hepatic metabolism of valproate, potentially leading to decreased valproate levels and increased seizure activity.\n\nA study published in the journal Epilepsia (2011) found that estrogen therapy can decrease valproate levels by approximately 20-30% in some individuals. However, this effect may be dose-dependent, and the impact on seizure control is not well established.\n\n**Keppra (Levetiracetam) and HRT:**\nKeppra is a synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) modulator, which is less likely to interact with hormones compared to Depakote. There is limited evidence to suggest a significant interaction between Keppra and HRT.\n\n**Potential Risks and Considerations:**\n\n1. **Estrogen-induced changes in Depakote levels:** As mentioned earlier, estrogen can decrease Depakote levels, potentially leading to increased seizure activity. Your current dose of Depakote (1000mg twice daily) may need to be adjusted to maintain therapeutic levels.\n2. **Hormonal fluctuations:** HRT can cause hormonal fluctuations, which may affect seizure control. It's essential to monitor your seizure activity and adjust your medication as needed.\n3. **Interactions with other medications:** You're also taking other medications, such as Adderall, which can interact with HRT or influence seizure control. Your neurologist should be aware of all your medications to minimize potential interactions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Consult your neurologist:** Before starting HRT, it's crucial to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your neurologist. They will help you weigh the risks and develop a plan to monitor your seizure activity and adjust your medication as needed.\n2. **Monitor your medication levels:** Regularly monitoring your Depakote and Keppra levels can help your neurologist adjust your doses to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize the risk of increased seizure activity.\n3. **Seizure diary:** Keep a seizure diary to track any changes in your seizure activity, which will help your neurologist make informed decisions about your treatment.\n4. **HRT regimen:** Consider discussing the type and dosage of HRT with your healthcare provider to minimize potential interactions with your seizure medications.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n1. **Sleep and anxiety:** As you mentioned, sleep and anxiety are triggers for your seizures. HRT can potentially affect sleep patterns, and it's essential to monitor your sleep quality and adjust your sleep hygiene practices as needed.\n2. **Calcium, Zinc, Magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation:** These supplements are essential for overall health, but their interaction with HRT is not well established. Continue to take them as prescribed, and monitor for any potential interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is limited evidence to suggest a significant interaction between Keppra and HRT, the potential effect of estrogen on Depakote levels is a concern. It's essential to discuss this with your neurologist to develop a plan to monitor your seizure activity and adjust your medication as needed. Remember to keep a seizure diary and inform your neurologist about any changes in your seizure activity or other medications."

        "question": "Female Age: 61 Weight: 185 Height: 5'2\" Heavy Smoker, Non-Drinker Medications: several blood pressure, gabapentin, depecote, also on anxiety med don't know the name right off.I'm looking for help, not diagnosis, but possible causes, reasons, some ideas of what to bring to the doctor. It's long and winded please read. I need help. Starting early last year (2018) she started having these falling spells. She'd be walking down the hall and just her legs would give out and start shaking back and forth then she'd be on the floor. After telling the doctor several times finally went to a neurologist. NONE of her doctors have ever seen one of these spells so they don't know exactly what we are talking about which is infuriating. She'll fall out of bed; she broke/fractured her back summer 2018 by falling out of bed. While in the hospital for a couple days...NEVER had a spell. Which was also infuriating because at home they happen several times a day. At first she was incoherent and didn't know where she was after having these spells and falls. She also has trembling of the hands and jerks. She's often burning holes in her clothes or bedding because she'll just drop the cigarette from a jerk, she's broken several glasses, plates, bowls. Now, a year later she's been diagnosed with epilepsy (summer/fall 2018) and is on depekote to deal with it and is supposed to be off gabapentin cuz they definitely don't mix for her. Causes great confusion and more falling spells. But now with advice from doctor she's on gabapentin in the morning and then depekote at night. Not supposed to mix with each other that way, however, she's still greatly confused. She has a 9th grade education didn't get a lot of what we learned in school as kids, but she wasn't dumb she could figure things out. Now, she can't spell, her memory is so gone, she barely remembers our childhood, she has no fricken idea how to spell or do simple math anymore. I blame the gabapentin and depekote together because that's when it started. But doc swears they don't do that...well I'm sorry your degree cannot tell me something I'm literally seeing every fucking day. But I digress. Now, she still has \"seizures\" is what they are calling them, but she doesn't fall she leans on something and is very coherent thru and all her body does is her legs violently shake back and forth like she's trying to balance on a surf board and its wildly going back and forth. She doesn't lose consciousness at all anymore, she's not as dingy as she was like last summer, but she's still losing basic skills every day. She does have a lot of plaque on the brain so my sister and I are thinking maybe it's early on-set Alzheimer's, but I truly honestly believe it is the depekote and gabapentin mixture. Doc doesn't think so. I have no medical degree obviously, but I see this shit going down every day. Like legit we talk about dinner around 10am so we can take it out of freezer and we'll discuss 2 or 3 meals and then ask everybody and then we will figure it out. Within 30 minutes of taking the meat out to thaw, she's already forgotten what we are having and then takes something else out. Then, we have two meats out and then have the other one the following night and then she's trying to figure out dinner for that night and forgets she's already taken something out. It's really aggravating, but I try not to get mad, but my sister gets thoroughly upset because it's like this every single day. And currently my husband and I live with my mom her husband (step dad) and my sister. Too expensive to live on own and my mom and stepdad can't afford all the bills by themselves and they are both on social security. She doesn't not have any medical insurance. We are hoping come March 2020 she'll be accepted on Medicare, but she was rejected this year, so we are just praying and hoping. This is causing me great anxiety; I have anxiety over losing my mom because of my grandma dying years ago. It kicked in some major anxiety of my mom dying. And this all causes me to not want to get a job after graduation. I graduate college in May '20 and I'm super excited about my career prospects I technically have 2 jobs lined up if I want them. I'm being headhunted and apparently my grades and studies are rock solid. IDK, but this causes me to want to just stay home and be with my mom daily and not miss anything, that FOMO thing going on. If we go by history with her family traced back to a couple hundred years ago; all females in this certain lineage all die at 67 and 5 months. She just happens to be in line, so do I. It's crazy, weird, and not exactly accurate, but with how her health has gone horrible since turning 60 I feel it's going to be accurate. And that scares me.",

        "answer": "I can sense the frustration, anxiety, and concern you have for your mom's health and well-being. It's understandable, given the complex medical situation and the impact it's having on your life. I'll try to provide some insights and suggestions to help you navigate this challenging time.\n\n**Possible causes and reasons:**\n\n1. **Medication interactions:** You're right to be concerned about the combination of gabapentin and depekote. Although your doctor says they don't mix well, it's possible that the interactions are contributing to your mom's cognitive decline and seizure-like episodes.\n2. **Epilepsy and seizure management:** The diagnosis of epilepsy and the introduction of depekote may not be fully addressing the underlying condition. It's possible that the seizures are not being properly managed, leading to continued cognitive decline.\n3. **Brain plaque and Alzheimer's:** The presence of plaque on the brain could be a contributing factor to your mom's cognitive decline. Early-onset Alzheimer's is a possibility, but it's essential to consult with a specialist to determine the cause.\n4. **Other potential factors:** Other factors, such as high blood pressure, smoking, and anxiety, may be contributing to your mom's overall health decline.\n\n**Suggestions and ideas to discuss with your doctor:**\n\n1. **Seek a second opinion:** Consider consulting with another neurologist or a specialist in geriatrics to get a fresh perspective on your mom's condition.\n2. **Medication review:** Request a thorough review of your mom's medications to ensure that the current regimen is optimal and not contributing to her cognitive decline.\n3. **Cognitive testing:** Ask your doctor about cognitive testing to assess your mom's cognitive function and determine the extent of her decline.\n4. **Seizure monitoring:** Discuss the possibility of seizure monitoring, such as EEG or video-EEG, to better understand the nature of your mom's seizures and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.\n5. **Alzheimer's screening:** If your doctor suspects early-onset Alzheimer's, ask about screening tests, such as biomarker tests or cognitive assessments, to determine the likelihood of this condition.\n\n**Personal concerns and anxiety:**\n\n1. **Support system:** Reach out to friends, family, or support groups to help cope with the emotional toll of caring for your mom.\n2. **Anxiety management:** Consider seeking professional help to manage your anxiety, such as therapy or counseling.\n3. **Career prospects:** While it's natural to want to prioritize your mom's care, don't let your anxiety hold you back from pursuing your career goals. You can explore flexible work arrangements or discuss your situation with your potential employers.\n4. **Medicare and insurance:** Continue to advocate for your mom's Medicare eligibility, and explore other insurance options, such as Medicaid or private insurance, to ensure she receives the necessary care.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Keep a symptom journal:** Document your mom's seizures, cognitive decline, and any changes in her condition to share with her doctor.\n2. **Attend doctor's appointments:** Accompany your mom to her medical appointments to ensure that her concerns are addressed and to provide emotional support.\n3. **Explore local resources:** Look into local resources, such as home care services, adult day care programs, or senior centers, to provide additional support and respite care for your mom.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this journey. Reach out to your support system, and don't hesitate to seek professional help when needed."

        "question": "My daughter is currently 7yrs old, epileptic (\"generalized\", idiopathic), ADD/ADHD, PDD, 15q26.1 microdeletion (not inherited). She's still illiterate, has issues getting to the bathroom (has a lot of \"accidents\") and lacks some finesse in her fine & gross motor skills. She's also slightly bow-legged. She's been seizure-free for over two years. When seizures initially presented, she was prescribed Topamax but it made her so dizzy she was unable to walk straight. She switched to a very low dose of valproic acid (maxed at 4mL 2/day). No other regular meds. About six months ago, her neurologist felt safe in discontinuing her valproic acid. Even though it was what the doc considered an extremely low dose, we noticed a huge change in our daughter's behavior. She just seems more \"present\" and aware of her surroundings. A few times she's had mood swings (sadness and crying) seemingly out of nowhere but all other aspects have been positive. Her PDD-related delays notwithstanding, she's made major strides in language, communication, following directions, etc; it's as if she previously wasn't aware of what was going on around her. When she was 2-3yrs old, we always marveled at what a happy-go-lucky child she was, never crying or throwing tantrums. Without the medication, she seems like she's much more like what we expected from that history. So, what gives? Valproic acid is also used for bi-polar so I can only assume there may have been a mood stabilizing effect of some sort but is there any explanation for the other communication-/social-related behavioral changes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "What a delightful and intriguing story of your daughter's progress! I'll try to break down the potential effects of valproic acid on her behavior and development, and offer some possible explanations for the changes you've observed.\n\n**Valproic acid's effects on behavior and cognition:**\n\n1. **Mood stabilization:** As you mentioned, valproic acid is used to treat bipolar disorder, which suggests it has mood-stabilizing properties. This could have contributed to the decrease in mood swings and emotional regulation issues you've seen since discontinuing the medication.\n2. **Sedative effects:** Valproic acid can have sedative effects, particularly at higher doses. However, even at low doses, it may have contributed to a subtle \"clouding\" of your daughter's awareness and responsiveness to her environment.\n3. **Cognitive and behavioral effects:** Some research suggests that valproic acid may have negative effects on cognitive function, particularly in children. This could include impaired attention, memory, and processing speed. Discontinuing the medication may have allowed your daughter's natural cognitive abilities to emerge, leading to improved communication, language, and social skills.\n\n**Possible explanations for the changes:**\n\n1. **Reduced cognitive load:** With the medication, your daughter may have experienced a \"cognitive load\" that made it more difficult for her to process and respond to her environment. Discontinuing the medication may have reduced this load, allowing her to be more \"present\" and aware.\n2. **Increased dopamine and norepinephrine:** Valproic acid can affect the levels and activity of certain neurotransmitters, including dopamine and norepinephrine, which play crucial roles in attention, motivation, and social behavior. Discontinuing the medication may have allowed these neurotransmitters to return to more normal levels, contributing to improved focus, motivation, and social interaction.\n3. **Compensatory mechanisms:** Children with neurodevelopmental disorders, like your daughter, often develop compensatory mechanisms to cope with their challenges. Discontinuing the medication may have allowed your daughter's brain to reorganize and adapt, leading to improved communication and social skills.\n4. **Natural developmental progress:** It's essential to remember that children with neurodevelopmental disorders can make significant progress as they mature. Your daughter's improved language, communication, and social skills may be a result of natural developmental progress, which was not necessarily hindered by the medication.\n\n**The 15q26.1 microdeletion connection:**\n\nThe 15q26.1 microdeletion is a genetic variant associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and epilepsy. While the microdeletion may contribute to your daughter's developmental challenges, it's unlikely to be directly related to the specific changes you've observed after discontinuing valproic acid.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nIt's essential to continue monitoring your daughter's progress and adjusting her treatment plan as needed. You may want to discuss the following with her neurologist:\n\n1. **Regular check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your daughter's seizure activity, behavior, and developmental progress.\n2. **Alternative treatments:** If your daughter experiences any adverse effects or regression, explore alternative treatments or therapies that may help mitigate these issues.\n3. **Therapeutic interventions:** Continue to provide your daughter with supportive therapies, such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy, to help her develop essential skills and adapt to her environment.\n\nKeep in mind that every individual is unique, and it's difficult to predict exactly how your daughter will respond to the discontinuation of valproic acid. However, with close monitoring and a collaborative approach with her healthcare team, you can work together to ensure she receives the best possible care and support."

        "question": "I'm a 23 year old guy. I recently had an ambulatory EEG as I occaisionally have partial siezures and I recieved a copy of a letter sent between the person who looked at the EEG recording and my neurologist. In the letter it says \"There were spike and wave discharges over the right frontotemporal and central regions maximally frontal\". I can't get hold of the neurologist right now so I was just wondering if someone here could tell me what that means as i didn't have an actual siezure at any point during the recording.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to help you decipher the technical jargon. Keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to consult your neurologist for a definitive interpretation. That said, I'll try to break down the information in the letter:\n\n**Spike and wave discharges:**\n\n* \"Spike and wave discharges\" refer to abnormal electrical activity patterns in the brain, which can be indicative of seizures or seizure-like activity. These discharges are called \"spike and wave\" because they appear as a sharp spike (a brief, high-amplitude electrical discharge) followed by a wave (a slower, lower-amplitude discharge).\n* The presence of spike and wave discharges can suggest a predisposition to seizures, even if no seizure occurred during the recording.\n\n**Location: Right frontotemporal and central regions:**\n\n* The EEG showed abnormal activity in specific areas of your brain:\n\t+ **Frontal region:** This area is involved in various functions, including motor control, language, and cognitive processes.\n\t+ **Temporal region:** This area plays a crucial role in processing auditory information, memory, and language.\n\t+ **Central region:** This area is located near the midline of the brain and is involved in motor and sensory functions.\n* The fact that the abnormal activity was \"maximally frontal\" suggests that the frontal region was the most affected.\n\n**Maximally frontal:**\n\n* This phrase indicates that the abnormal activity was most prominent in the frontal region, with the greatest amplitude (or intensity) of the spike and wave discharges occurring in this area.\n\n**No seizure during the recording:**\n\n* As you mentioned, you didn't experience a seizure during the recording. This is not uncommon, as seizures can be unpredictable and may not occur during the relatively short period of the EEG recording.\n* The presence of spike and wave discharges, however, suggests that your brain may be prone to seizure-like activity, even if a seizure didn't occur during the test.\n\nIt's essential to discuss these findings with your neurologist, as they can provide a more detailed interpretation and recommend the next steps in your care. They may want to:\n\n1. Review the EEG recording in more detail.\n2. Discuss your medical history, symptoms, and any potential triggers for your partial seizures.\n3. Consider additional testing, such as MRI or further EEG monitoring.\n4. Adjust your treatment plan, if necessary, to manage your seizures and prevent future episodes.\n\nPlease try to schedule a follow-up appointment with your neurologist as soon as possible to discuss these findings and any concerns you may have."

        "question": "I am a 42 year old male. Feel free to remove this post if it is not appropriate for this sub, or maybe re-direct me to a better place. My main goal from this post is to best understand my options for free or at least affordable medical insurance. I currently receive unemployment from my previous employer because when I accepted a job transfer, I was promised full time hours and am not getting that. So, I currently earn $630 per week on weeks I do not work. This lasts for about another 3-4 months and then is over. This is important because, even though the income is helpful, it seems to prevent me from qualifying for medical insurance for free. My employer will not offer insurance to me until I work there for six months and hit a certain number of hours that I will not get. Even though it was a transfer, it is a different union. I looked into ObamaCare. Here in California it is called Covered California. Making $630 per week does not give me a break on paying, and the monthly rates and co-pays and deductibles are much higher than I am comfortable with. Anyways, in mid-January, I passed out twice. Since then I have not been the same; extreme disorientation, zoning in and out, difficulty doing basic things. Even fun things like watching movies or playing video games is a chore and I usually do not finish. A coworker took me to Tijuana because medical care is cheaper there. They did tests that still cost $1000 and found a cyst on my brain that might be causing seizures but unsure if that is the cause. They gave me Keppra and it bascially made me sleep 20+ hours per day. Doctor cut dose in half and doesn't seem to help at all, but still side effects. Doctor was very nice but English was limited. I cannot drive now, especially while taking meds. I do not feel comfortable working, and will likely make a lot of mistakes if I do, and also potentially hurt myself and others. I am a server. I have not worked since January 28. I wish I can pause my income from unemployment long enough to qualify for medical assistance and get more properly tested, diagnosed and treated. I am sure it does not work that way though. I already owe $5000 for an ER visit. A doctor at a clinic near here told me that even though I was denied for free medical insurance to go to ER, get a big bill, and then they will cover me. That was wrong and now I owe $5000 I cannot afford. I understand if I qualify for medical assistance within 3 months of that visit, it will be covered. Unfortunately, unemployment goes another 3-4 months so that won't likely work out.  Might San Diego County work something out for a limited amount of time for medical insurance? The sooner I have coverage, the quicker I can get treated and hopefully back to work. And if something more major is going on, then they can intervene sooner than later. Another idea; is it true that Medicare covers people with low income and/or disabilities? Does something like epilepsy or seizures or cyst on the brain go under that category? If so, will something from the doctor in Mexico work, or will I need something from a US doctor? I am so scared and overwhelmed. Our medical system is so flawed. I should not have to worry about stuff like this and I know others have similar issues. This stress is terrible for my medical condition I am sure. I know some will say to get to a doctor now and not worry about the money part of it. Easier said than done. I also know one option is to wait for 4 months until unemployment runs out, then I qualify and then get treated but still owe the $5000 from the ER visit prior and then make the best of it. This is not idea. I do not want to spend another 4 months sleeping most of the day, taking a med that doesn't seem to help, and not work or do anything. What a waste of life. I hope the county will have options to compromise and maybe some programs out there for someone in an odd situation like myself. Maybe the hospital will use a charity fund to help with the $5000 as well?  Also, once unemployment runs out, is my only chance of income either short term disability through work (I assume I get a doctor to sign and I get some income) or social security disability (which I hear is nearly impossible to qualify for if under age 50 even if a serious medical condition). I plan to call a county worker Monday. Most of the paperwork is already filed. I expect them to say that I do not qualify for any medical assistance since I make too much money. Is there anything else I can say/do? or anything else they might be able to do? Oh, I do have all of the test results from Mexico, but in Spanish. Scan of my brain (shows cyst) and an EEG (normal results). ER visit was in San Diego and all heart and brain tests came back normal. Please anyone who might know resources, questions to ask, or anything; I will be extremely grateful. Keppra makes me agitated and irritable and not myself and not helping with seizures. I have seizures often every day. They are not obvious to others but I am constantly zoning in and out and basically a zombie and this is exhausting on my brain. I feel I need more cardiology tests to rule out heart issues (family history and ER referred me to get more testing I just cannot afford). Other option is I can try to continue going to Mexico but I will now need a driver and translator.

        "answer": "I can sense the desperation and frustration in your post. I'm here to help you navigate the complex US healthcare system and provide guidance on potential options. I'll break down the key points and suggest questions to ask the county worker when you call them on Monday.\n\n**Summary of your situation:**\n\n1. You're currently receiving unemployment benefits ($630/week) for the next 3-4 months.\n2. You're not eligible for your employer's medical insurance until you've worked for six months and met certain hour requirements.\n3. You've been experiencing seizures, disorientation, and other symptoms since January, and a doctor in Tijuana found a cyst on your brain.\n4. You've been taking Keppra, but it's not effective, and you're experiencing side effects.\n5. You owe $5,000 from an ER visit and are seeking affordable medical insurance options.\n\n**Potential options:**\n\n1. **Medi-Cal**: California's Medicaid program might be an option, but you'll need to apply and see if you qualify. Since you're receiving unemployment benefits, you might not qualify immediately. However, if your benefits end, you may become eligible.\n2. **Covered California**: You've already explored this option, but you might want to revisit it to see if there are other plans or subsidies available.\n3. **County health services**: San Diego County might have programs or resources that can help you access medical care, such as a county-sponsored health plan or sliding-scale clinics.\n4. **Medicare**: If you're diagnosed with a disability, such as epilepsy, you might be eligible for Medicare. However, this typically requires a US doctor's diagnosis and documentation.\n5. **Short-term disability**: If your doctor confirms that you're unable to work due to your medical condition, you might be eligible for short-term disability benefits through your employer.\n6. **Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)**: This is a federal program that provides income support to people with disabilities. However, as you mentioned, it can be challenging to qualify, especially if you're under 50.\n\n**Questions to ask the county worker:**\n\n1. Are there any county-sponsored health plans or programs that I might be eligible for, despite my current income from unemployment benefits?\n2. Can you help me apply for Medi-Cal or other state-funded programs?\n3. Are there any local non-profit organizations or charities that provide medical financial assistance or discounts for people in my situation?\n4. Can you connect me with a patient advocate or social worker who can help me navigate the healthcare system and explore available resources?\n5. Are there any programs or services that can help me with the $5,000 ER bill, such as a charity care program or financial assistance program?\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n1. **Get a US doctor's diagnosis**: Try to find a doctor in the US who can evaluate your condition and provide a diagnosis that might help you qualify for Medicare or other programs.\n2. **Explore local non-profit organizations**: Look into organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation or the Brain Injury Association, which might offer resources, support, and guidance on navigating the healthcare system.\n3. **Contact a patient advocate**: Organizations like the Patient Advocate Foundation or the National Patient Advocate Foundation can provide guidance and support in navigating the healthcare system and accessing affordable care.\n4. **Seek assistance with the ER bill**: Reach out to the hospital's billing department or a patient financial advocate to discuss possible financial assistance or charity care programs.\n\nRemember to stay calm and assertive when speaking with the county worker, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification on any options or programs they suggest. Keep in mind that it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being during this challenging time."

        "question": "F 25, 165 lbs So i know this sounds like a weird question. But I have 100% confirmed case of temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed since age 3. Since then ive had strokes, had brain surgery, developed an autoimmune disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome btw) . So needless to say, my brain has taken a beating. So why do i think im having non epileptic seizures? Well these seizures tend to only happen at work. They present differently than my normal seizures. And afterwards i don't have the stereotypical post-ictal headache. I usually have A headache. But not as bad as I'd usually expect from just having a seizure. The only thing that leads me to thinking maybe they are real is that i tend to have an aura before they happen. The same aura as my normal seizures. (A cold tingly feeling on thebleft side of the body, vidual disturbance in the left eye, sinking feeling in the stonach) But instead of having a normal simple partial or worse complex partial seizure. I have this weird episode where my face is twitching (sometimes a limb or two) and im having trouble breathing(coworkers have described it to me). So what's going on? Am i having a new manifestation of seizures that cause difficulty breathing? Or am i having nonepileptic seizures triggered by work stress? And would nonepileptic seuzures come with an aura before them? Also would someone who is having non epileptic seizures be aware that they are having non epileptic seizures? Sorry if im going in a circle. It's just confusing having epilepsy for 20+ years just for your condition to change.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I understand your concerns and confusion. Given your complex medical history, it's not surprising that you're questioning the nature of these new episodes. I'll try to provide some insight, but please keep in mind that a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified healthcare professional.\n\n**Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES):**\nNES, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), are episodes that resemble epileptic seizures but are not caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or other psychological factors. NES can manifest in various ways, including twitching, shaking, and difficulty breathing, which you've described.\n\n**Aura and NES:**\nWhile auras are typically associated with epileptic seizures, it's possible for people with NES to experience auras or prodromal symptoms before an episode. However, these auras are often different from those experienced by people with epilepsy. In your case, the fact that you're experiencing a similar aura to your typical seizures is intriguing, but it doesn't necessarily mean that these new episodes are epileptic in nature.\n\n**Awareness during NES:**\nPeople experiencing NES may be aware of their episodes, but their awareness can be altered or limited. Some individuals may report feeling detached or disconnected from their body during an episode, while others may be fully aware of their surroundings.\n\n**Distinguishing features:**\nTo differentiate between epileptic seizures and NES, consider the following:\n\n1. **Triggers:** NES are often triggered by stress, anxiety, or emotional factors, whereas epileptic seizures can be triggered by various factors, including sleep deprivation, stress, or certain medications.\n2. **Episode characteristics:** NES tend to be more variable and unpredictable in their presentation, whereas epileptic seizures often follow a more consistent pattern.\n3. **Post-ictal phase:** As you mentioned, the post-ictal phase (after the episode) can be different for NES, with less severe headaches and no typical post-ictal confusion or lethargy.\n4. **Response to treatment:** NES often do not respond to anti-epileptic medications, whereas epileptic seizures typically do.\n\n**What's going on with you?**\nGiven your complex medical history, it's possible that you're experiencing a combination of both epileptic and non-epileptic phenomena. The fact that these episodes only occur at work suggests that stress or anxiety might be contributing factors. However, the presence of an aura and the similarity to your typical seizures make it difficult to rule out an epileptic component.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Consult your neurologist:** Share your concerns and observations with your neurologist, and ask for their opinion on the possibility of NES or a new manifestation of your epilepsy.\n2. **Video EEG monitoring:** Consider undergoing video EEG monitoring to capture and analyze these episodes. This can help determine if they are epileptic or non-epileptic in nature.\n3. **Stress management:** Explore stress-reducing techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or cognitive-behavioral therapy, to help manage work-related stress and anxiety.\n4. **Keep a seizure diary:** Record your episodes, including any triggers, symptoms, and post-ictal effects. This can help identify patterns and provide valuable information for your healthcare team.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to determine the cause of these episodes and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

        "question": "(24F, 5\"7, 14st 11, no drugs/drink/smoking) Current medical conditions: endometriosis, pcos, non epileptic seziures. Current medication: mirtazapine I was treated for epilepsy from the age of 9 to 23 with a few different medications. I have been on topiramate, lamotragine, epilim and keppra. The dose varied from.a few 100mg to 1000mg over the years. At 23 I found out my seizures were non epileptic and came off my medicines. Since then, my mood has had bigger swings. I've been the lowest I've ever been in my life, ending up in a&e trying to end my life a few weeks ago. However, my mood rapidly changes over a day from extremely low to being a bit reckless. I have ended up in trouble with my money like this. This usually lasts about a week then I become low again. My question was whether is was possible that after 14 years on anti epilepsy drugs, they were unintentionally treating something related to my mood?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm troubled to hear about your struggles with your mental health and the challenges you've faced. It's understandable that you're questioning the potential impact of long-term antiepileptic medication on your mood, given the significant changes you've observed since stopping these medications.\n\nAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are known for their mood-stabilizing effects, which is why some are used off-label to treat bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. The medications you mentioned, such as lamotrigine and topiramate, are particularly noted for their mood-stabilizing properties. Lamotrigine, for example, is sometimes used to treat bipolar depression.\n\nGiven that you were on these medications for 14 years, starting from a young age, it's plausible that they could have been influencing your mood stability, possibly mitigating some symptoms of mood disorders without you realizing it. The withdrawal from these medications could then potentially uncover or exacerbate underlying mood instability.\n\nYour rapid mood swings, ranging from extreme lows to reckless behavior, resemble symptoms associated with mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder. The pattern of cycling between depressive episodes and periods of hypomania or mania (if the reckless behavior is indicative of hypomanic episodes) is characteristic of bipolar spectrum disorders.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your symptoms and history with a healthcare provider, preferably a psychiatrist who can assess whether your symptoms might be related to a mood disorder that was masked or managed by the antiepileptic medications. They can help determine if starting mood-stabilizing medication again, or exploring other treatments for mood disorders, might be beneficial for you.\n\nAdditionally, given your history of non-epileptic seizures, endometriosis, and PCOS, there might be other factors contributing to your mood instability, including hormonal influences or the psychological impact of chronic conditions. A comprehensive approach that considers all aspects of your health will be crucial in managing your symptoms effectively.\n\nPlease remember that you're not alone, and seeking help is a sign of strength. Continuing to work with mental health professionals to find the right treatment approach for your specific situation is key. Have you considered reaching out to a crisis helpline or support group for additional resources and support during this challenging time?"

Full blown bed-ridden migraines ~15-16. Myoclonic Seizures 17. Tonic-Clonic seizures 18. Migraines disappeared. Varying seizures becoming more frequent and severe until current age. Smoke pipe tobacco. 1-3 pipes/day. No other non-prescribed drugs including alcohol EXCEPT Ibuprofren 200mg and Kratom 5 grams 3x daily for headaches when they're in full force. Acamprosate 666mg 3x daily, Baclofen 20mg 3x daily, Levitiracetam 1500mg 2x daily, Zonisamide 200mg nightly. Hydroxyzine 25mg nightly. Librium 10-30mg as needed for seizure clusters. Zofran 4-8mg as needed or every 4 hours. Propranolol 20mg 2x/day (they thought it'd help for anxiety about pending seizures). Seizure/Migraine history is same as an uncle. Everything progressed the same. Whether it's relevant I'm not sure. The severe \"I can't stand light/sound, I want to cry\" type migraines mostly disappeared and only happen rarely rather than almost daily now. I do however get long periods of headaches. Sometimes like today almost comparable to the migraines just not as intense. Today for example, strong pain starting behind right eye. It's throbbing and radiating through the whole right side of my head back to my neck. It's spread into the left of my head to an extent but not as intense. I'm past 3 months of this now. Some days like this, some days it's more general (as in, more even around the head and less throbbing but more of a constant annoying pain). I've two PCPs, an epileptologist and another neurologist however my epilepsy is my primary focus and I've had little time to go over these headaches. I used to take Imitrex and something else when I had the severe migraines but they didn't help. Nothing OTC seems to help. I only continue the Ibuprofren due to having cubital tunnel syndrome and having it recommended for that. The kratom helps dull the pain a little. I know it's an opiod. Honestly in the past I've taken hydrocodone and oxycodone for these headaches and they also only dulled it. esting pulse is around 40-60bpm. Blood pressure averages around 110/60 give or take. I'm not sure if these are tension headaches, mild migraines or somehow epilepsy related. Provided my migraines happened before my seizures started I'm wondering about the latter however if you're a doctor I'm sure you know it can be hard to tell with these things. Alike with migraines and epileptic episodes, I get visual auras with these headaches - \"white flashing waves of light\" is how I'd usually describe them. Nausea is very common during these periods hence the zofran. I had sleep apnea quite bad and finally got my bipap setup properly a bit over a month ago and now only have <1 to 3 events/hour so I doubt that's related anymore. I'm sleeping fairly well. The nicotine use is infrequent and not even daily. Sometimes I go months without it. I mentioned 1-3 pipes a day as that's my current use. Nicotine and caffeine excluded, the headaches remain. Days like today light bothers me a bit. High pitched sounds or constant sound are overwhelming. I'm not sure how mild migraines can be/if these headaches can be related but they remind me of a minor version of what I used to get. They start immediately when I wake and persist until I fall asleep. Usually on a high-fat keto diet for the epilepsy but no matter how I eat the headaches don't change. Whatever medications I am/am not on also don't seem to alter their behavior when this happens. It's wearing on me this time. Usually it's gone by a couple months but now I'm passing 3. Any input that I could then take back to my doctors would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "answer": "I'll provide you with a general assessment, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional. It's essential to consult your doctor or a qualified healthcare expert for personalized advice.\n\nUsing a welder with a history of possible seizure activity requires careful consideration. While you've been seizure-free for 3 years and take medications to control them, there are still some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Seizure risk**: Although you've been seizure-free, there's still a small risk of having another seizure, especially when engaging in activities that involve intense focus, physical demands, or exposure to flashing lights (e.g., welding).\n2. **Welding safety**: Welding can be a hazardous activity, even with proper PPE. If you were to have a seizure while welding, it could lead to accidents, injuries, or even fatalities.\n3. **Medication and welding**: Some medications, including those used to control seizures, can impair your reaction time, coordination, or judgment. This could affect your ability to operate a welder safely.\n\nGiven your situation, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: Schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your desire to use a welder. They can assess your current medical condition, medication regimen, and seizure risk to provide personalized advice.\n2. **Get a medical clearance**: Ask your doctor to provide a medical clearance certificate, which states that you're fit to engage in welding activities. This certificate can help you demonstrate to your employer or welding instructor that you've taken the necessary precautions.\n3. **Choose a safe welding environment**: If you receive medical clearance, ensure you're welding in a safe environment with proper ventilation, lighting, and PPE. Avoid welding in confined spaces or areas with hazardous materials.\n4. **Consider a welding helmet with a seizure warning system**: Some welding helmets have built-in systems that detect seizures or other medical emergencies. These helmets can alert others in the surrounding area, ensuring timely assistance if needed.\n5. **Regular health check-ups**: Continue to monitor your health and attend regular check-ups with your doctor to ensure your medication regimen is effective and your seizure risk remains low.\n\nIn terms of specific guidelines, the American Welding Society (AWS) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provide general recommendations for welders with medical conditions. However, these guidelines may not specifically address seizure disorders.\n\nTo ensure your safety and the safety of others, it's crucial to follow the recommendations of your doctor and take necessary precautions when using a welder. If your doctor advises against welding, consider alternative activities or hobbies that are safer and less likely to trigger a seizure.\n\nPlease consult your doctor before making any decisions, and remember that your health and safety should always be the top priority."

The thing is my hand couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t actually move Bc I was laying on it but it was like in my imagination. It feels like my brain is zipped up. I sometimes think I can hear it. It happens when I\u2019m waking up, falling asleep, or laying in bed It\u2019s kinda like a whooshing feeling",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing a unique and complex phenomenon that involves elements of sleep paralysis, but with distinctive sensory and cognitive components that you're struggling to describe. This experience seems to blend physical sensations (like a \"tight\" brain or a rattling feeling), auditory sensations (such as hearing a \"whooshing\" sound), and perhaps even a sense of internal, mental movement or control (as in the case of the magnet-like sensation moving your hand, though your hand didn't actually move).\n\nLet's break down your symptoms to try and understand what might be happening:\n\n1. **Sleep Paralysis**: This condition is characterized by being unable to move or speak when falling asleep or waking up. You mentioned you can open your eyes during these episodes, which is somewhat atypical since many people with sleep paralysis report being unable to move or speak, and sometimes their eyes are closed or they're in a dream-like state.\n\n2. **Brain Feeling \"Tight\" or Rattling**: These sensations could be interpreted as a form of somatic hallucination, where your brain creates intense, internal physical sensations that aren't based on actual physical movements or stimuli.\n\n3. **Hurricane Feeling and Control Over Sensations**: The hurricane feeling, which intensifies based on internal yes/no questions, suggests there might be a component of self-induced or internally modulated phenomena. This could imply some level of cognitive or emotional processing occurring during these episodes, though the exact mechanisms are unclear.\n\n4. **\"Magnet\" Moving the Hand**: This sensation, where your hand feels like it's being moved by an unseen force without any actual movement, could be a form of kinesthetic hallucination, which is a sensation of movement without actual motion occurring.\n\n5. **Whooshing Feeling and Sensation of Brain Being \"Zipped Up\"**: These auditory and tactile hallucinations suggest complex sensory processing abnormalities, possibly related to transitions between sleep and wakefulness or states of heightened brain activity during rest.\n\nGiven the uniqueness and variability of your experiences, it's challenging to pinpoint a single cause or condition that explains everything. However, several possibilities could be considered:\n\n- **Neurological Conditions**: Certain conditions, like epilepsy, migraines, or even multiple sclerosis, can cause a wide range of sensory disturbances. Though your symptoms are unusual, discussing them with a neurologist might provide insights.\n\n- **Sleep Disorders**: Beyond sleep paralysis, other sleep disorders or transitions between different sleep stages could be contributing factors to your experiences.\n\n- **Anxiety or Stress**: The mind's ability to influence sensory experiences, especially under conditions of stress or anxiety, could play a role. Techniques like meditation, mindfulness, or cognitive behavioral therapy might help mitigate these episodes by reducing overall stress levels.\n\n- **Psychological Factors**: The component of control over these sensations through internal questioning suggests a potential psychological aspect, where cognitive processes and perhaps even expectations or fears might be influencing the experiences.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n\n1. **Seek Professional Help**: Consult with a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist or a sleep specialist, to explore potential neurological or sleep-related causes.\n\n2. **Keep a Journal**: Documenting these episodes, including when they happen and any patterns or triggers you notice, could provide valuable information for healthcare providers.\n\n3. **Reduce Stress and Improve Sleep Hygiene**: Engaging in relaxing activities before bed, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, and avoiding stimulating activities close to bedtime might help reduce the frequency or intensity of these episodes.\n\n4. **Explore Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation can help manage stress and potentially reduce the occurrence of these unusual sensations.\n\nRemember, the complexity and uniqueness of your experiences mean that finding the right answers or solutions might take time and involve consulting with several healthcare professionals."

So they want me to come in for observation with an EEG running on me for up to 5 days. See what can be crossed out from it. The last two EEG\u2019s showed nothing. ( a 30 min & and 2 hour one.) So what should I expect going in? What types of tests do you do on someone after Epilepsy is ruled out? What other options are there? I\u2019m scared.. I\u2019m a new mom, and some days I\u2019m terrified to care for my baby.. Now I have to leave her for days. Full list of symptoms Stage 1- The warning stage: I feel like how you feel going in an elevator (how different parts of you are moving at different speeds) with my head/ brain mixed with a non painful head smack. I start loosing the ability to talk, and my legs start collapsing Stage 2- In the episode: I keep consciousness, loose all motor control and look dead. My mouth opens up, and I slosh to a side. My eye lids flutter, pupils dilate, and my eyes shift around in all directions. I can hear, see and think. I just can\u2019t move. Lasts between a 10 seconds to a minute or so Stage 3- Recovery: Varies based on severity and how many I have had in succession. Which has been up to 8 or more back to back. Then I have confusion, stuttering, and muscle weakness. As well as occasionally stabbing pain inside bones down one of my arms. Which arm is not constant. I can have 3-50 a day, and some days. If I am lucky I wont have any. I get them a lot dealing with baby, but sometimes when I am alone or asleep (I can tell because if I wake up after having them I have to walk on my knees so I don\u2019t fall. Too weak otherwise.)

I'm here to provide you with some information and guidance, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's essential to follow your doctor's advice.\n\nGiven your symptoms and medical history, it's great that your doctors are taking a thorough approach to try to determine the cause. Since epilepsy has not been ruled out entirely, the extended EEG monitoring is a reasonable next step. This will help them capture any potential seizure activity that may not have been detected during the previous shorter EEG tests.\n\n**What to expect during the EEG monitoring:**\n\n1. You'll be asked to wear an EEG cap or have electrodes placed on your scalp to record your brain activity.\n2. The EEG machine will be connected to a monitor, and the data will be stored for later analysis.\n3. You'll be monitored for up to 5 days, during which time you may be asked to perform various activities, such as:\n\t* Keeping a seizure diary to record any episodes\n\t* Performing physical activities, like walking or stretching\n\t* Engaging in cognitive tasks, like puzzles or reading\n\t* Sleeping or resting to capture any potential nocturnal episodes\n4. The medical team may also use other tests, such as:\n\t* Video monitoring to record any physical changes during episodes\n\t* Blood tests to rule out other conditions or check for any abnormalities\n\t* Imaging studies, like an MRI or CT scan, to visualize your brain and rule out any structural issues\n\n**If epilepsy is ruled out:**\n\nYour doctors may consider other potential causes for your symptoms, such as:\n\n1. **Functional neurological symptom disorder (FNSD)**: a condition where neurological symptoms, like numbness, weakness, or tremors, are present without any clear medical explanation.\n2. **Migraines or other headache disorders**: some types of migraines can cause neurological symptoms, like aura, numbness, or weakness.\n3. **Vasovagal syncope**: a condition where the nervous system overreacts to certain triggers, causing fainting or near-fainting episodes.\n4. **Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)**: a condition where seizures are caused by psychological factors, rather than neurological ones.\n5. **Other conditions**, such as:\n\t* Narcolepsy\n\t* Sleep disorders\n\t* Autonomic nervous system disorders\n\t* Neurodegenerative diseases (although these are less likely given your age and medical history)\n\n**Tips for passing the time during the EEG monitoring:**\n\n1.

        "question": "Height: 5'5\" Weight: 140 Race: White Drinking/smoking/recreational drugs: No Medications: Adderall (10mg)I had left temporal lobe epilepsy as a child; from 7 weeks of age to about a year I was having 4-5 grand mal seizures a day. From about 1-2 I had one or two drop seizures a week. During early childhood I also had several complex partial seizures a week. My last EEG until just recently was at about 14 \u00ac\u2014 at that point I still had \"slowing in the left temporal lobe.\" My recent EEG was completely normal.I've been trying to figure out how much of my current difficulty functioning (including difficulty with concentration, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and memory issues) are more tied to PTSD or remnants of damage done by all the seizures. As far as I know, I haven't had seizures in many years. The PTSD is tied to a number of events both as a child and as an adult.I was also knocked unconscious once at about 14, in a riding accident. My helmet cracked all the way through (back of the head), but I wasn't out for very long. Maybe less than a minute. I never went to a doctor for it.If PTSD is playing a big part in my difficulties, a stellate ganglion block is an option I'm interested in investigating more... but it won't help me if my issues are long-term consequences of all those seizures.Who would best be able to help me figure out what to do? I could consult a neurologist, or get a comprehensive evaluation by neuropsych. The department that mentions doing nerve blocks is the pain center. I can't afford to keeping piling on medical bills, so I'd appreciate any insight on who would be most likely to be able to help, and also on what kind of long-term consequences one might expect to see from my sort of seizure history. (And how likely is it that I'm just in the clear now, as far as epilepsy goes?) Thanks for reading. I have been seeing a therapist, but as an LCSW she can't really speak to the MD side of these issues. I can't keep going like this.",

        "answer": "I can sense the frustration and desperation in your message. It's great that you're taking proactive steps to understand the underlying causes of your difficulties. Given your complex medical history, it's essential to consult with a specialist who can help you untangle the potential contributions of your epilepsy, PTSD, and other factors to your current symptoms.\n\nConsidering your options, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist who has experience in epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. They can help you understand the potential long-term consequences of your childhood epilepsy and assess whether your current symptoms are related to any residual effects of your seizures. A neurologist can also evaluate the results of your recent EEG and provide guidance on whether further testing or monitoring is needed.\n\nA comprehensive evaluation by a neuropsychologist can also be beneficial in assessing your cognitive function, particularly in areas such as attention, memory, and executive function. They can help identify any cognitive deficits or strengths and provide recommendations for strategies to improve your daily functioning.\n\nRegarding the stellate ganglion block, it's true that the pain center department may be the one to perform this procedure. However, before exploring this option, it's crucial to have a thorough evaluation by a neurologist or a psychiatrist to determine whether your PTSD symptoms are likely to respond to this treatment.\n\nAs for the long-term consequences of your seizure history, research suggests that individuals with a history of epilepsy, particularly those with frequent seizures in childhood, may be at risk for:\n\n1. Cognitive deficits: Difficulties with attention, memory, language, and executive function.\n2. Mood disorders: Depression, anxiety, and mood instability.\n3. Behavioral problems: ADHD-like symptoms, impulsivity, and behavioral dysregulation.\n4. Sleep disturbances: Insomnia, daytime fatigue, and sleep-wake cycle disruptions.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that every individual's experience is unique, and the severity and impact of these consequences can vary widely.\n\nIn terms of your epilepsy, it's possible that you may be in remission, but it's difficult to predict with certainty. Your recent normal EEG is a positive sign, but it's still important to maintain regular follow-up appointments with a neurologist to monitor your condition.\n\nTo minimize medical bills, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Start by consulting with your primary care physician or therapist to discuss your concerns and get a referral to a neurologist or neuropsychologist.\n2. Check with your insurance provider to see if they cover consultations with specialists and what the out-of-pocket costs might be.\n3. Look into local universities or research institutions that may offer low-cost or sliding-scale fee assessments with neurologists or neuropsychologists.\n4. Consider seeking a second opinion or consulting with a specialist who offers telemedicine services, which may be more affordable than in-person visits.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being. While it may take some time and effort to find the right specialist and get the answers you need, it's worth it to improve your quality of life. Keep advocating for yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out to your therapist or support network for help along the way."

        "question": "Hello! I saw on the internet that occasionally some epilepsy medications such as Lamictal can react to HRT. This reaction can cause an increase in seizure activity. That of course is not my specific question.My question is does Depakote 1000mg therapeutic level, and Keppra 1000mg once at night reactive towards HRT treatments. As I am considering going through the process of transferring my gender from male to female via HRT treatments and I am rather worried that this may cause an increase in my seizures.My seizure disorder is: Juvenile Myoclonic EpilepsyDrugs I currently take: 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the AM, 1 1000mg Depakote pill in the PM, 1 1000mg Keppra pill at night. 1 Calcium/Zinc/Magnesium supplement pill in the AM, 1 Vitamin D pill in the AM. 1 3mg meletonin pill prior to bed. 10mg of Adderal when needed.Epileptic triggers: Sleep, anxiety.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're doing your research and being proactive about your seizure disorder and potential interactions with HRT. I'll provide you with some general information and insights, but please consult your neurologist and healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\n**Depakote (Valproate) and HRT interaction:**\nDepakote is not typically known to interact with HRT in a way that would increase seizure activity. However, some studies suggest that estrogen can increase the levels of valproate in the body, potentially leading to increased side effects or toxicity. On the other hand, testosterone has been shown to decrease valproate levels. Since you're considering female-to-male HRT, the introduction of estrogen may affect your Depakote levels.\n\n**Keppra (Levetiracetam) and HRT interaction:**\nKeppra is not known to have significant interactions with HRT. However, some case reports suggest that estrogen may affect Keppra levels, but the evidence is limited and inconclusive.\n\n**General considerations:**\nWhen starting HRT, it's essential to monitor your seizure activity, as the introduction of hormones can affect your seizure threshold. Estrogen, in particular, can have a complex effect on seizure activity, and some people may experience increased seizures during the initial phases of HRT.\n\n**Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and HRT:**\nJME is a generalized epilepsy syndrome that can be sensitive to hormonal changes. Some studies suggest that the introduction of estrogen can increase seizure activity in people with JME, particularly during the initial phases of HRT.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nTo minimize potential risks and interactions:\n\n1. **Consult your neurologist and healthcare provider**: Discuss your plans for HRT and potential interactions with your medications. They may recommend adjusting your medication regimen or monitoring your seizure activity more closely.\n2. **Monitor your seizure activity**: Keep a seizure diary to track any changes in your seizure frequency or severity.\n3. **Regular blood work**: Your healthcare provider may recommend regular blood tests to monitor your Depakote and Keppra levels, as well as your liver function and other parameters.\n4. **HRT dose and type**: Your healthcare provider may consider the type and dose of HRT, as well as the gradual introduction of hormones, to minimize potential interactions.\n5. **Be aware of potential side effects**: If you experience any changes in your seizure activity, mood, or overall health, report them to your healthcare provider promptly.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\nAs you're also taking Adderall, which can affect seizure activity, it's essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider. Additionally, your melatonin supplement may interact with your other medications or affect your seizure activity, so it's crucial to monitor your response to this supplement as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some evidence to suggest potential interactions between HRT and your medications, the specific effects on your seizure disorder are uncertain. Close monitoring and collaboration with your healthcare provider will help minimize potential risks and ensure the best possible outcome for your transition and seizure management."

        "question": "Sex: Female Age: 21 Location: Europe Diagnose: Epilepsy (diagnosed two years ago) Medication: Timonil retard, MedotriginHello. It is very hard to describe, but I will do my best. I have been having some problems.It started about two years ago. It just appeared out of nowhere. My world started looking weird. Everything I saw was like in a movie or dream, everything was moving so slow and colours were just strange. I could see things happening around me, I heard people talking and everything, but I couldn't react. It just seemed so hard. It happened very often, it usually lasted for a few hours and after these \"episodes\" I became too tired, so during these days I slept for like 15 hours a day. When I fainted, my mum made me go to doctor. I underwent MRI and EEG. The results were great, the doctors saw nothing. But after my complaining, I was diagnosed with epilepsy with absence seizures. I got mediacation, first only medotrigin, which I still take twice a day. It helped, but only for a short time, so my doctor gave me another pills, timonil (once a day). But that didn't help either. I need to visit my doctor every 3 months when I undergo EEG exam. The results are always good, so my doctor doesn't seem to believe me.The thing is that my condition has gotten way worse in the past 2-3 months. These \"episodes\" happen very often, almost every day and they again take hours, sometimes even longer than before. I am very sensitive to light and noise, I can't even work normally. I am scared of doing anything because sometimes it happens that I just start looking at something and suddenly I stop reacting, people just talk to me and I don't respond. And sometimes I even don't remember anything. I got depressive and I cry a lot because I can't live like this. Is it really just epilepsy?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general insights and suggestions. It sounds like you're experiencing a very challenging and frustrating situation with your epilepsy diagnosis and medication.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your symptoms, although diagnosed as absence seizures, have not been entirely controlled by the medication. The fact that your condition has worsened in the past 2-3 months, with more frequent and longer-lasting episodes, suggests that your treatment plan may need to be reassessed.\n\nIt's possible that your medication regimen, which includes Timonil Retard and Medotrigin, may not be effective enough to manage your seizures. Your doctor may need to consider adjusting the dosage or adding another medication to help better control your symptoms.\n\nThe additional symptoms you're experiencing, such as heightened sensitivity to light and noise, depression, and memory lapses, could be related to your epilepsy or possibly other underlying conditions. It's crucial to discuss these symptoms with your doctor to rule out any other potential causes.\n\nConsidering your doctor's skepticism about your symptoms, it may be helpful to:\n\n1. **Keep a seizure diary**: Track the frequency, duration, and triggers of your episodes to provide more concrete evidence of your symptoms.\n2. **Seek a second opinion**: Consult with another neurologist or epilepsy specialist to get a fresh perspective on your condition and treatment options.\n3. **Discuss other potential causes**: Ask your doctor to investigate other possible conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms, such as migraines, anxiety disorders, or other neurological conditions.\n4. **Explore additional therapies**: Depending on your specific situation, other therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or lifestyle modifications (e.g., stress management, sleep hygiene) may be beneficial in managing your symptoms and overall well-being.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be proactive and advocate for yourself in your healthcare. Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek additional opinions, or request changes to your treatment plan if you feel it's not effectively managing your symptoms.\n\nPlease consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance. They can help you navigate the complexities of your condition and develop a more effective treatment strategy."

        "question": "So over the last 10 years, I have had ongoing fainting episodes with no real answers. I have been mostly evaluated by cardiologists who say it is vasovagal but no trigger has been identified. I have an implanted loop recorder which shows my heart slowing and then pausing. The pauses last anywhere from 5-13 seconds. Before the episode, I do get a \u201cwarning\u201d which helps me get into a safer (usually) position. I get a really strong sense of deja vu and everything feels really surreal and like it has happened before even though I know it hasn\u2019t. I regain consciousness pretty quickly but have a range of issues for the next few hours/day including being foggy headed, bad short term memory over the next hour or so, getting cold, digestive issues etc. not to mention it worries the people around me :)Mostly these episodes have occurred when I\u2019ve been sitting however in the last 6-12 months they have started occurring while I\u2019ve been in different positions (sleeping while laying flat and most recently while standing.) The frequency has also started to increase and I feel like my memory is getting worse as well. It\u2019s always been a bit of an issue but it seems like I am forgetting more and more \u201cmedium range\u201d events/things. Like things that have occurred in the past few months/years or things people have told me in the past few weeks. In the beginning these episodes were occurring once every six months but now they are coming as close as 4 weeks apart which an average of every second month. There seems to be an underlying pattern of these episodes occurring in the week before my period and sometimes when I have been dealing with stressful situations. I do manage my stress through meditation, gym,counseling etc and don\u2019t feel like I am acutely stressed when I have these episodes.The cardiologists I\u2019ve seen have advised that I should drink a lot of water and make sure I get up from my desk and walk around every 30 minutes or so. I have taken their advice but my condition just seems to be slowly getting worse and now they want to talk about a pacemaker. I\u2019ve had another episode today and am feeling very frustrated and like my doctors aren\u2019t listening to me.I am pretty fitness minded so I have a sit/stand desk and a water bottle with measurements to see how much water I\u2019ve drank. Today, I was standing when I had the episode and had just been walking around . I had drank over 1 liter of water, eaten breakfast and lunch with a snack and it was approximately 2pm. I do not at all get the feeling that this is related to my water intake or sitting/standing. I have a referral to a neurologist (10 years ago I saw a neurologist but was told it was cardiac related) but have to wait two more months for the appointment. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if any of the doctors out there could provide me with any insights or ideas to give me some comfort during the next two months? Could this be a form of temporal lobe epilepsy or something related to hormones? I have read some research papers saying that sinus pauses are an atypical symptom of epilepsy but that it does happen? Anyway, thanks in advance, anything is really appreciated!",

I don't know how to describe it... it was non painful once, other than that it's usually painful. and I sometimes...float out of my body....like i see from a different view. and occasionally hear voices, if i slip into a scary fit, It's sometimes growling or a loud high pitched whistle. muscle pains, and I can feel my mouth moving while its happening, like if i try to speak. and I sometimes feel like I'm spiralingthen after all of that I usually wake up feeling drained and sore, and my head is foggy and feels like i'm lagging behind a bit. it stays with me the entire day, I can power through it now that I'm older, but when I was a teenager it dragged me down, and I had to post-pone daily activities because of the after effects. it comes in bouts, like some months it'll happen for at least 2 weeks, then disappear for a little, then come back.  usually for me I think being sleep deprived is a trigger for it, I used to stay awake for days at a time because of it, it was a cycle, be sleep deprived> trigger it> be afraid to sleep so i force myself to stay awake> be sleep deprived> trigger it. but recently it was under control, but I stood up a 4 hours past my usual sleeping time and it happened. and I always sleep on my side, and may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, so I sleep elevated.it's been making my life really hard...I'd almost gone a week without it happening.....l just woke up from one and my neck feels sore, I usually dismiss this as sleep paralysis but after thinking about the \"brain electric feeling\" and I'm scared, sleep paralysis isn't dangerous, but if I'm having seizures it's dangerous isn't it? I can't go to a doctor right now, because I have no healthcare, and I live with immunocompromised family members, so I can't go as much as I would like to, I can't risk it because of covid. any advice would be helpful....I'm sorry for being all over the place and writing so messy, I'm kinda foggy right now....Thank you for reading,",

        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing these terrifying and debilitating episodes. I'll try to help you break down your symptoms and provide some guidance.\n\n**Sleep Paralysis (SP) vs. Other Conditions**\n\nWhile your symptoms align with sleep paralysis, the \"brain electric feeling\" and buzzing/shaking sensations could be indicative of other conditions, such as:\n\n1. **Sleep-related seizures**: As you mentioned, seizures can manifest during sleep and cause unusual sensations, including buzzing or electrical feelings.\n2. **Sleep-related movement disorders**: Conditions like restless leg syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder can cause unusual sensations, like buzzing or vibrating feelings.\n3. **Migraines or other headache disorders**: Some people experience aura-like symptoms, including buzzing or electrical feelings, before a migraine or other headache types.\n\n**Key differences between Sleep Paralysis and Seizures**\n\nWhile sleep paralysis is generally not dangerous, seizures can be a serious condition. Here are some key differences to consider:\n\n1. **Duration**: Sleep paralysis episodes typically last from a few seconds to a few minutes. Seizures, on the other hand, can last longer, and you may experience a post-ictal phase (after the seizure) with confusion, fatigue, or other symptoms.\n2. **Loss of consciousness**: During sleep paralysis, you're usually aware of your surroundings, whereas seizures can cause a loss of consciousness or altered consciousness.\n3. **Motor symptoms**: Sleep paralysis is characterized by temporary paralysis, while seizures can cause convulsions, twitching, or other motor symptoms.\n\n**What to do next**\n\nGiven your concerns and limited access to healthcare, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Keep a symptom journal**: Record your episodes, including the date, time, duration, and any triggers or symptoms you experience. This will help you track patterns and identify potential triggers.\n2. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Stress and anxiety can exacerbate sleep paralysis. Try relaxation methods like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation to help manage stress.\n3. **Improve sleep hygiene**: Establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and create a sleep-conducive environment to reduce sleep deprivation.\n4. **Consider online resources**: Look into online forums, support groups, or telemedicine platforms that can provide guidance and support while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 exposure.\n5. **Seek medical attention when possible**: When it's safe to do so, consult a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and rule out underlying conditions that may be contributing to your episodes.\n\n**Coping with the aftermath**\n\nTo manage the fatigue, soreness, and fogginess after an episode:\n\n1. **Allow yourself time to recover**: Take breaks and rest when needed.\n2. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help alleviate fatigue and headaches.\n3. **Gentle exercises**: Engage in low-intensity activities, like stretching or yoga, to help manage muscle tension and soreness.\n4. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you comfort and relaxation.\n\nRemember, your symptoms are not \"just\" sleep paralysis, and it's essential to explore other possibilities to ensure your safety and well-being. When you can access medical care, be sure to share your detailed symptom journal and concerns with your healthcare provider.\n\nPlease take care of yourself, and I hope this information helps you feel more informed and empowered to manage your symptoms."

        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general insights and potential explanations for your experiences. However, please keep in mind that a proper diagnosis can only be made by a qualified medical professional, and I strongly encourage you to consult a doctor or a neurologist as soon as possible.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems you're experiencing two types of episodes:\n\n1. **D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes**: These episodes, which you've been experiencing since December, seem to be related to a specific memory that you can't quite recall. They're brief, lasting around 5-10 seconds, and are accompanied by a headache and dizziness. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a common phenomenon, but in your case, it's associated with a specific memory and physical symptoms, which could indicate a neurological component.\n2. **Disorientation and memory loss episodes**: You've had two instances of this type, where you wake up feeling disoriented, experience nausea, and have gaps in your memory. The most recent episode was triggered by a car crash, which caused you to lose memories of the past week. This type of episode is more concerning, as it involves significant memory loss and disorientation.\n\nConsidering your symptoms, here are a few potential explanations:\n\n* **Aura epilepsy**: As your friend suggested, it's possible that you're experiencing a type of epilepsy, specifically aura epilepsy, which can cause brief, episodic symptoms like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, headaches, and dizziness. However, aura epilepsy typically precedes a seizure, which you haven't mentioned experiencing.\n* **Temporal lobe epilepsy**: This type of epilepsy can cause d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, memory disturbances, and other symptoms you've described. However, it's essential to note that a diagnosis of epilepsy requires a thorough medical evaluation, including EEG tests and other assessments.\n* **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**: The car crash could have triggered PTSD, which might contribute to your memory loss and disorientation. However, this wouldn't explain the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes you've been experiencing since December.\n* **Other potential causes**: Other possible explanations for your symptoms include migraines, anxiety disorders, or even sleep disorders.\n\nIt's essential to consult a doctor or neurologist to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing your symptoms. They will likely perform a thorough evaluation, including:\n\n* Medical history and physical examination\n* Neurological examination\n* EEG tests (to assess brain activity)\n* Imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scans) to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain\n* Psychological evaluations to assess for anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions\n\nIn the meantime, try to:\n\n* Keep a symptom journal to track when your episodes occur, what triggers them, and how long they last\n* Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you've been evaluated by a medical professional\n* Manage your stress and anxiety through relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They will help you develop a plan to manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being."

I was 21 the first time I fainted on an airplane, it's happened 6+ times in the air since. I have also fainted on land in various situations starting around age 13.My primary issue is fainting on airplanes, particularly long-haul flights. I have a 14 hour flight coming up and will be traveling alone so thought I'd ask here for advice, prevention methods, etc. What usually happens is I get suddenly very dizzy, hot and clammy, my ears start ringing loudly and then I pass out. I'll wake up about a minute later surrounded by concerned flight attendants and passengers. I've always been seated, although several times it's happened immediately after waking up. Sometimes the flight attendants bring me juice or water, or they ask the captain to turn the cabin temperature down. Afterward I feel pretty tired and shaky for the rest of the day.The most recent time this happened (about 6 months ago), I was sitting next to a nurse who woke me up with a sternum rub. She suggested I get checked for diabetes. Other people have said to get checked for epilepsy.I've seen my GP as well as specialists - neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist. They ruled out epilepsy, heart condition, or diabetes. Normal tests results across the board.As for the maybe 10+ times I've fainted while not on an airplane, it's usually been attributed to heat, dehydration, period pain, or not eating. I struggled with disordered eating as a teenager (never diagnosed but definitely an issue; I eat well and frequently now). Doctors have said \"drink more water\", \"eat more salt\", and (my favorite) \"sometimes girls faint\"  Here's are some things I do to help with flying:- wear compression socks- no coffee day of, no alcohol in the week leading up- eat salt tablets periodically throughout flight- drink about 64 oz of water while in the air (depending on length of the flight)-regular, filling meals the night before and day of the flightI'd love to hear any insight into fainting, what might be causing it, or advice on how to prevent it in the air.

There are many potential causes, including:\n\n1. Vasovagal syncope (common faint): triggered by stress, pain, or emotional distress, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate.\n2. Orthostatic hypotension: a drop in blood pressure when standing up or changing positions.\n3. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances: can cause dizziness and fainting.\n4. Anxiety and stress: can contribute to fainting, especially in sensitive individuals.\n\n**Hashimoto's and Hypothyroidism**\n\nYour Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism may be contributing factors to your fainting episodes. Some research suggests that hypothyroidism can cause:\n\n1. Orthostatic intolerance: a condition characterized by a drop in blood pressure when standing up.\n2. Autonomic dysfunction: affecting the autonomic nervous system, which regulates heart rate, blood pressure, and other functions.\n\n**Air Travel and Fainting**\n\nThe unique environment of air travel, including:\n\n1. Low air pressure\n2. Cabin pressure changes\n3. Dehydration\n4. Limited mobility\n5. Stress and anxiety\n\nmay trigger or exacerbate fainting episodes in susceptible individuals.\n\n**Additional Potential Causes**\n\nConsidering your medical history and symptoms, it's possible that you may be experiencing:\n\n1. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**: characterized by a rapid heart rate and other symptoms upon standing, which may contribute to fainting.\n2. **Autonomic dysfunction**: affecting the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various bodily functions, including heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n3. **Sensitivity to air pressure changes**: some people may be more sensitive to changes in air pressure, which could trigger fainting episodes during flights.\n\n**Prevention Strategies**\n\nIn addition to your current measures, consider the following:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: Discuss your concerns and fainting history with your GP and specialists. They may recommend further testing or adjustments to your medication.\n2. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after the flight. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n3. **Electrolyte balance**: In addition to salt tablets, consider adding electrolyte-rich beverages or supplements, like coconut water or sports drinks, to your in-flight routine.\n4. **Avoid triggers**: Identify and avoid triggers that may contribute to fainting, such as stress, anxiety, or specific foods.\n5. **In-flight positioning**: Try to stay seated with your feet on the floor or a footrest, and avoid crossing your legs or ankles, which can restrict blood flow.\n6. **Pressure garments**: Consider wearing pressure garments, like compression stockings or sleeves, to help improve blood flow and reduce swelling.\n7. **Relaxation techniques**: Practice relaxation methods, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help manage stress and anxiety during flights.\n8. **Inform the flight crew**: Let the flight attendants know about your condition and fainting history, so they can provide assistance if needed.\n\n**For Your Upcoming Flight**\n\nIn preparation for your 14-hour flight, consider the following:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: Get a pre-flight check-up and discuss any concerns or new strategies.\n2. **Pack essentials**: Bring a water bottle, electrolyte-rich drinks, snacks, and any medications or supplements recommended by your doctor.\n3. **Choose a suitable seat**: Opt for a seat over the wing, as it tends to experience less turbulence.\n4. **Stay active**: Get up and move around the cabin periodically to improve circulation and reduce the risk of blood clots.\n5. **Be prepared for emergencies**: Keep your phone charged and easily accessible, and consider carrying a portable charger."

        "question": "When I came down with epilepsy in 2010, I began having a strange change in energy level. At first I thought it was just the medication, but when I go on r/epilepsy and explain it, nobody responds. I don't think they are experiencing the same thing, even though most of them take keppra like I do.Basically, I was going through a big weight loss leading up to the epilepsy. I lost 65 pounds. I would go to the gym for 1 - 1.5 hours and do 20 mile hikes on the weekends. Things were looking up. I even got a new relationship and was about to start a new career in EMS.Then I woke up in the hospital. I had a huge seizure in my sleep and my wife saved my life. I lost my future career and even my job, because I lost my license.So once things stabilized a bit, I tried to reestablish my habits. I found that I had no energy at the gym. After 15 min working out, I would feel like I was going to literally pass out. I would feel this way on short hikes, too.Over time, I was discouraged by my sudden change in performance to where I was less and less motivated. I literally couldn't exercise. I gradually gained all the weight back. If I explain any of this to a doctor now, they will just kind of roll their eyes at me. They think I lost my energy because I'm fat, not the other way around. They don't care to listen.I've been researching a little into leaky gut etc but I think it's hard because people are barely scratching the surface. Do I have seizures because of autoimmune disease?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm troubled to hear about your struggles with epilepsy and the subsequent impact on your energy levels and overall well-being. It's understandable that you're seeking explanations and solutions, especially when your experiences seem to diverge from those of others in similar situations.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that epilepsy is a complex condition with a wide range of effects on individuals. The Energy changes you're experiencing could indeed be related to your epilepsy, either directly due to the seizures themselves or as a side effect of the medication. Keppra (levetiracetam) is known for its relatively favorable side effect profile compared to other antiepileptic drugs, but it can still cause fatigue, among other effects.\n\nYour significant weight loss before the onset of epilepsy, followed by a regain of weight after diagnosis, introduces another variable. Weight changes can independently affect energy levels and exercise tolerance. However, it's crucial to consider whether there's a link between your epilepsy and these physical changes.\n\nRegarding the potential connection to autoimmune diseases, such as those involving \"leaky gut,\" the relationship between gut health, autoimmune diseases, and neurological conditions like epilepsy is an area of ongoing research. Some theories suggest that an imbalance in gut bacteria (dysbiosis) or increased gut permeability (\"leaky gut\") could contribute to inflammation and potentially exacerbate or even contribute to the development of seizures in susceptible individuals. However, these ideas are still speculative and not widely accepted as primary causes of epilepsy.\n\nGiven your experience with significant changes in energy levels and exercise tolerance that seem to coincide with the onset of your epilepsy, it might be beneficial to consult with healthcare professionals who are open to exploring these correlations further. This could include neurologists with an interest in the metabolic or immunological aspects of epilepsy, or possibly even integrative medicine practitioners who might consider factors like diet, lifestyle, and gut health in the context of your condition.\n\nWhen discussing your situation with doctors, it might be helpful to keep a detailed journal of your energy levels, exercise attempts, and any potential seizure activity. This documentation can provide valuable insights into patterns or correlations that might not be immediately apparent. Additionally, advocating for yourself and seeking a second opinion if you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed is important.\n\nWhile the path forward may involve some trial and error, persistent advocacy for your health, and potentially exploring non-traditional theories under the guidance of healthcare professionals, it's essential to approach claims about specific diets or supplements (like those aimed at \"leaky gut\") with a critical eye. Ensure that any interventions you consider are evidence-based and discussed with your healthcare team to avoid potential interactions with your medication or exacerbation of your condition.\n\nYour situation underscores the complex interplay between physical health, neurological conditions, and personal well-being. Finding healthcare providers who are willing to listen, consider your unique experiences, and work collaboratively with you to address your concerns will be key to navigating this challenging situation."

        "question": "25F - Last week I laughing gas at the dentist for the time, next day I had an episode with seizure-like movements, hyperventilating and was unable to move or speak. Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.Last Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off. Wednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing. Basically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. Any idea what this could be? FYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll try to provide some insights, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and only a qualified doctor can provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIt's essential to note that laughing gas (nitrous oxide) can have varying effects on individuals, and some people may experience adverse reactions. Your experience, although unusual, doesn't necessarily indicate a long-term condition.\n\nThe episode you described on Wednesday, with seizure-like movements, hyperventilation, and inability to move or speak, is concerning. The fact that paramedics and ER doctors couldn't find any immediate cause for the episode might suggest that it was an isolated reaction to the laughing gas. However, the subsequent daily \"freezes\" and difficulty processing you've been experiencing are worth investigating further.\n\nPossible explanations for your symptoms could include:\n\n1. **Post-anesthetic phenomenon**: Some people may experience lingering effects from anesthesia or sedation, such as confusion, disorientation, or temporary cognitive impairment. Although laughing gas is not a traditional anesthetic, it can still cause similar effects.\n2. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common condition characterized by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to fainting or near-fainting episodes. Your symptoms, such as nausea, hotness, and faintness, could be related to vasovagal syncope.\n3. **Conversion disorder**: Also known as functional neurological disorder (FND), this condition involves neurological symptoms that can't be explained by a medical condition. FND can manifest as \"freezes,\" difficulty processing, or other motor symptoms.\n4. **Anxiety or stress response**: Although you mentioned no personal history of anxiety, the traumatic experience of having an unexpected episode might have triggered a stress response, leading to symptoms like hyperventilation, \"freezes,\" or difficulty processing.\n5. **Neurological condition**: As the ER doctor suggested, it's possible that you might have an underlying neurological condition that was triggered or revealed by the laughing gas. Conditions like epilepsy, seizures, or other neurological disorders should be ruled out through further testing.\n\nTo better understand your symptoms and determine the underlying cause, it's essential to follow up with your neurologist appointment and undergo any recommended tests, such as:\n\n* EEG (electroencephalogram) to evaluate brain activity\n* MRI or CT scans to rule out structural abnormalities\n* Neurological examination to assess cognitive and motor function\n* Psychological evaluation to explore potential anxiety or stress-related factors\n\nIn the meantime, consider the following:\n\n* Keep a symptom journal to track the frequency, duration, and triggers of your \"freezes\" and processing difficulties.\n* Avoid any potential triggers, such as stress or certain medications, that might exacerbate your symptoms.\n* Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help manage any anxiety or stress.\n\nPlease consult with your neurologist and primary care physician for personalized guidance and treatment. They will help you determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an effective management plan."

        "question": "I suffered from this as a baby (parents said I almost died at birth and they had to put me in really cool environments and use ice at the hospital since I had low oxygen at birth. For a few weeks I was on some baby monitor ( I was also a c section) did a bit of searching online but couldn't find much discussion about this.About me currently Im a 28 year old Male 28M , the birth asphyxia obviously happened during birthAre there things happening during birth asphyxia that could leads to other issues? I suffer from ADHD or ADD which makes me wonder if this came from birth asphyxia and I have definitely had reactions to strong flashing lights when I was a teenager (still do a bit) i read that seizures could be a complication from birth asphyixia.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm glad you're exploring the potential effects of birth asphyxia on your life. Birth asphyxia, also known as perinatal asphyxia, occurs when a baby's brain and other organs do not receive enough oxygen before, during, or after birth. This can lead to a range of short-term and long-term complications.\n\nGiven your history of birth asphyxia and subsequent hospital treatment, it's possible that you may have experienced some of the following effects:\n\n1. **Brain injury**: Lack of oxygen during birth can cause damage to the brain, which may lead to developmental delays, learning disabilities, or neurological disorders like ADHD or ADD. Research suggests that birth asphyxia may increase the risk of developing ADHD, although the exact relationship is still being studied.\n2. **Seizures**: As you mentioned, seizures are a potential complication of birth asphyxia. This is because the lack of oxygen can damage the brain's electrical activity, leading to abnormal seizures. Although you don't mention experiencing seizures, it's possible that you may have had subtle seizures or epilepsy-like activity that weren't diagnosed.\n3. **Sensory sensitivities**: Your reaction to strong flashing lights as a teenager (and still experiencing it to some extent) could be related to the brain's altered development due to birth asphyxia. Some research suggests that birth asphyxia can affect the brain's sensory processing, leading to increased sensitivity to certain stimuli, like light or sound.\n4. **Other potential effects**: Birth asphyxia has been linked to various other conditions, including:\n\t* Learning disabilities and cognitive impairments\n\t* Behavioral problems, such as anxiety or depression\n\t* Motor skill difficulties or coordination problems\n\t* Sleep disorders\n\t* Vision or hearing impairments\n\nIt's essential to note that the effects of birth asphyxia can vary widely depending on the severity of the asphyxia, the duration of the lack of oxygen, and individual factors like genetics and overall health.\n\nConsidering your ADHD/ADD diagnosis, it's possible that birth asphyxia may have contributed to your condition. However, it's also important to recognize that ADHD/ADD is a complex disorder with multiple potential causes, and a definitive link between birth asphyxia and ADHD/ADD cannot be established without further research.\n\nTo better understand your situation, you may want to:\n\n1. **Consult with your parents**: Ask them to provide more details about your birth, hospital stay, and any subsequent medical issues you experienced as a child.\n2. **Review your medical records**: Obtain your birth records and any relevant medical documents to gain a better understanding of your treatment and any potential complications.\n3. **Discuss with a healthcare professional**: Share your concerns with a doctor or a neurologist, and ask about the potential effects of birth asphyxia on your brain development and overall health.\n4. **Explore research and resources**: Look into organizations and studies focused on birth asphyxia, ADHD/ADD, and related conditions to learn more about the potential connections and effects."

        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Given the range of symptoms you've described, it's understandable that you're concerned, especially about the possibility of a brain tumor. However, it's crucial to approach this systematically and consider the combination of your symptoms, test results, and medical history.\n\n1. **Phantom Smells**: These can be associated with various conditions, including neurological issues. The initial suspicion of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is notable, but the EEG results suggest this is not the case. Phantom smells can also be related to other conditions, such as migraines, sinus issues, or even stress and anxiety.\n\n2. **Eye Floaters and Bright Flashing Lights**: These symptoms, especially when noticed in sunlight, can be related to posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) or other eye conditions. While they can be alarming, they are often benign.\n\n3. **High Pitch Noise in One Ear, Muscle Twitching, Headaches, Lightheadedness, and Cognitive Symptoms**: These can be attributed to a variety of factors including stress, anxiety, depression, and in some cases, iron deficiency (given your mention of low iron levels).\n\n4. **Dental Issue**: The decaying tooth could potentially cause neurological symptoms if there's an infection spreading, but this would likely manifest with more localized symptoms such as pain or swelling.\n\n5. **Stress, Anxiety, and Depression**: These can have profound effects on both physical and mental health, potentially exacerbating or mimicking a wide range of symptoms, including many of those you've described. The recent breakup and high-stress period could certainly contribute to your symptoms.\n\nGiven your GP's assessment, it seems they are not immediately concerned about brain tumors, which are relatively rare. However, it's completely reasonable to express your concerns and seek a thorough evaluation. Here are some steps you might consider:\n\n- **Request a Referral to a Specialist**: Given your range of symptoms, seeing a neurologist might provide a more detailed assessment of your neurological health. An ophthalmologist could also evaluate the floaters and flashing lights to determine if there's an underlying eye condition.\n\n- **Mental Health Support**: Continuing or increasing support for your anxiety and depression could help alleviate some of your symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness techniques can be particularly helpful in managing stress and anxiety.\n\n- **Iron Levels**: Ensure you're following the recommended treatment for your low iron levels, as deficiency can cause a range of symptoms.\n\n- **Dental Care**: Addressing the dental issue could help prevent any potential complications.\n\nIt's also important to remember that while it's good to be informed, excessive worry about rare conditions like brain tumors can exacerbate anxiety. A thorough medical evaluation can help identify any underlying issues and provide a plan for addressing them. Keep an open dialogue with your healthcare providers about your concerns and symptoms; they can offer guidance tailored to your specific situation."

With Ramadan approaching I was wondering how much time there needs to be in between taking one pill at night and one in the morning, thanks.Let me know if I need to add anything else.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Ramadan Mubarak!\n\nIt's great that you're thinking ahead and planning your medication schedule during fasting. I'll provide some general guidance, but please consult your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice.\n\nKeppra (levetiracetam) is an antiepileptic medication, and its dosing schedule is crucial to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent seizures.\n\nThe general recommendation for taking Keppra is to take it with food, and the timing of doses should be consistent to maintain steady blood levels. When fasting during Ramadan, you'll need to adjust your dosing schedule to ensure you're taking your medication at the right times.\n\nHere are some general considerations:\n\n1. **Fasting period**: During Ramadan, the fasting period typically starts at dawn (Suhoor) and ends at sunset (Iftar).\n2. **Nighttime dose**: You can take your nighttime dose (500mg) before dawn, when you're having your Suhoor meal. This way, you'll have taken your medication before the fasting period begins.\n3. **Morning dose**: For your morning dose (500mg), you'll need to wait until you've broken your fast at sunset (Iftar). It's recommended to take your medication with food, so you can take it with your Iftar meal.\n4. **Minimum interval**: The minimum interval between doses of Keppra is usually 12 hours. However, this may vary depending on your individual situation and your doctor's recommendations.\n\nTo be on the safe side, consider the following:\n\n* Take your nighttime dose (500mg) about 1-2 hours before dawn, when you're having your Suhoor meal.\n* After breaking your fast at sunset, wait for about 1-2 hours before taking your morning dose (500mg) with your Iftar meal.\n\nExample:\n\n* Nighttime dose: 4:00 AM (1 hour before dawn) with Suhoor meal\n* Morning dose: 7:00 PM (1 hour after sunset) with Iftar meal\n\nPlease consult your doctor or pharmacist to confirm the best schedule for your specific situation. They may recommend adjustments based on your individual needs, medical history, and other factors.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following:\n\n* Make sure you have a consistent food intake to minimize potential side effects of Keppra, such as dizziness or drowsiness.\n* Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water during non-fasting hours.\n* If you experience any side effects or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with your doctor or pharmacist to determine the best medication schedule for your specific situation during Ramadan. They can provide personalized guidance to ensure your safety and the effectiveness of your medication."

        "question": "Recently I got a hickie, and tons of people started telling me to be careful because I could die, and stuff. Is it that dangerous? Male 17, epilepsy, anxiety, question: are hickies dangerous?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "In most cases, hickies are not life-threatening. However, there are some rare risks associated with them.\n\n1.  **Vasovagal Response**: This is a reflex of the involuntary nervous system that can cause fainting due to the sudden decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. This can be dangerous if you fall and injure yourself or if you have an underlying heart condition. Given your history of anxiety, this is something to be aware of, but it's still a rare occurrence.\n\n2.  **Blood Clots**: In extremely rare cases, the sucking action can cause blood clots to form. These clots can potentially dislodge and travel to other parts of the body, causing serious health issues. This is more of a concern for people with pre-existing blood clotting disorders.\n\n3.  **Infection**: If the skin is broken during the process, there's a risk of infection. This is not unique to hickies and can happen with any skin injury.\n\n4.  **Allergic Reactions**: Some people may have allergic reactions to the saliva of the person giving the hickey. This is rare and usually results in mild symptoms, but it can be more severe in some cases."

I would just live at the doctor's if I went every time something happens, especially since I have had several issues since I was a kid, but I also want to be mindful to not ignore things that might be important. I also tend to write off things as just depression/hormones, and once it was an iron deficiency, for instance. Thank you in advance!!   No idea what is related, so I will list things that have changed just in case, in order of concern. EELING FAINT/FATIGUE: I can't exercise much because I feel super lightheaded and I can't do some exercises now because I feel I am going to faint and I have had to cut down my training sessions. Thought I wasn't eating enough, but upped protein intake and started tracking calories and I am at maintenance level.  DEMOTIVATION: I want to be lying on the couch a lot even though it hasn't been typical of me. I am very demotivated, like nothing excites me and I can get a bit weepy (but I have had recurrent trouble with depression in the past so it might be that not being able to do much is making me lightly depressed...). I just moved to a nordic country, so thinking it might be related to the change into the autumn season, I am using a therapy lamp and started taking vitamin D. The lamp worked the first week. URINE: Every time I pee, it used to be clear because I drink so much water and now it is always very yellow no matter how much water I drink. LIGHT PERIOD: My period has become super light since last September, but the last 2-3 times I hardly have had it. I have taken a pregnancy test every 4 weeks just in case. All negative. I used to have 1 very, very heavy day changing tampon at least once an hour and some spotting after. A few years ago it was 3-4 of these very heavy days. OVARIAN PAIN: I have a 5cm cyst (found 10 years ago, grown from 2.5cm) that feels fuller and tender. It has been hurting me so much more than usual, cramping several times this last month and it hurts when I stretch or when I do certain exercises. I only mention this in case you know whether exercise or stretching can cause it to burst or twist the ovary to avoid it or in the off chance that it might be cancer related. I feel my hunger increased, but it might be unrelated, more nausea than usual. I have also been feeling like I am catching a flu constantly and I have already had what seems like a cold twice this month.",

I will stay hyper for hours afterwards and not feel surgical pain for the same amount of time. It can be quite funny, I talk at 100mph and can\u2019t stop giggling. I don\u2019t feel sick at all and always want water and food immediately. Drs/nurses etc have commented it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even have surgery, but I\u2019ve never asked if there\u2019s a reason why. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but codeine does absolutely nothing for me and I always need extra anaesthetic at the dentist. I\u2019ve never been told I\u2019m difficult to put under GA. Thank you in advance, I\u2019ve been wondering for years.",

        "answer": "It's fascinating that you've experienced this unique phenomenon after surgery, and I'm happy to help you explore possible explanations.\n\nConsidering your medical conditions and medications, there are several factors that might contribute to your unusual post-surgical hyperactivity and pain tolerance:\n\n1. **ADHD and Tourette's:** Individuals with ADHD and Tourette's often have altered neurotransmitter profiles, particularly with regard to dopamine and norepinephrine. These chemicals play a significant role in regulating mood, attention, and pain perception. It's possible that your brain's unique chemistry contributes to your hyperactive state after surgery.\n2. **Epilepsy and Lamotrigine:** Lamotrigine, an antiepileptic medication, can have a mood-stabilizing effect and may influence your response to anesthesia and pain. Some people with epilepsy are more resistant to the effects of certain anesthetics, which could be related to your need for extra anesthetic at the dentist.\n3. **Sertraline:** As an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), Sertraline can affect pain perception and mood regulation. It's possible that Sertraline contributes to your reduced pain sensitivity and hyperactive state after surgery.\n4. **Genetic factors:** You might have a genetic predisposition that affects your response to anesthesia and pain. Some people are naturally more resistant to anesthetics, which could be related to your need for extra anesthetic at the dentist.\n5. **Stress response:** Surgery can be a significant stressor, triggering the release of stress hormones like adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol. Your brain's stress response might be more pronounced, leading to increased alertness, energy, and pain tolerance after surgery.\n6. **Anesthetic metabolism:** Your body might metabolize anesthetics more efficiently, which could lead to a faster recovery and reduced pain sensitivity. This could be related to your genetic profile or enzyme activity.\n\nThe fact that codeine is ineffective for you and you require extra anesthetic at the dentist suggests that you might have an altered opioid receptor profile or different pain processing mechanisms. This could be related to your ADHD, Tourette's, or genetic factors.\n\nIt's essential to note that every person's response to anesthesia and surgery is unique, and there might be a combination of factors contributing to your experiences. I recommend discussing your observations with your healthcare provider or an anesthesiologist to explore these potential explanations further.\n\nIn the meantime, it's great that you've found the humor in your post-surgical hyperactivity, and it's wonderful that you're taking an active interest in understanding your body's responses. Keep asking questions and seeking answers \u2013 it's the best way to advocate for your own health and well-being!"

        "question": "20 year old old Female. I\u2019m taking 500mg of Keppra every morning for my epilepsy and I\u2019ve been on it for about two years. I\u2019ve just recently stopped taking amitriptyline 25mg about a week now. I\u2019ve been going through the withdrawals but it\u2019s been easing and the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad besides the chills and shakes. I also take Ventolin inhalers for my asthma as well as paracetamols for migraines here and there. Anyway, I\u2019ve had this sort of pain months ago. The stomach pain was unbearable and lasted a week or so until it soothed. It completely went away after a month or so. I think the annoying part was I constantly felt like I needed the bathroom. After the first day I didn\u2019t actually need to use the bathroom but it just constantly felt like I did. It was very uncomfortable. I think eating made it worse but I can\u2019t be too sure. I stopped drinking sodas or spicy foods and drank decaffeinated green tea with honey everyday. It went away and now suddenly it\u2019s back. I\u2019m also late with my period by 23 days but I usually have irregular periods. My stomach gurgles a lot too. If my stomach pain isn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s me needing to use the bathroom or my stomach making noises. My distress triggers anxiety attacks and that also doesn\u2019t help.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm here to listen and help you explore possible explanations for your symptoms. Given your medical history, it's essential to consider various factors that may be contributing to your stomach pain, discomfort, and other symptoms.\n\n**Potential causes:**\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal issues:** Your symptoms, such as stomach pain, feeling like you need to use the bathroom, and gurgling noises, could be related to gastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), acid reflux, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n2. **Medication interactions:** As you've recently stopped taking amitriptyline, it's possible that the withdrawal process is affecting your digestive system. Additionally, the interaction between Keppra and other medications, including Ventolin and paracetamol, might be contributing to your symptoms.\n3. **Hormonal changes:** Your delayed period could be related to hormonal fluctuations, which may also be influencing your digestive system. Hormonal changes can affect gut motility, bowel movements, and stomach sensitivity.\n4. **Diet and lifestyle:** Although you've made some dietary changes, such as avoiding sodas and spicy foods, other factors like eating habits, stress levels, and sleep patterns might still be contributing to your symptoms.\n5. **Anxiety and stress:** Your anxiety attacks can exacerbate digestive issues, creating a cycle of discomfort and distress.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult your doctor:** Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist to discuss your symptoms, medical history, and medication regimen.

        "question": "Gender: Female, Age: 9, Height: Idk tbh, Location: Head, How long ago: 1 week.So my co-workers daughter was just diagnosed with grey matter heterotopia. She was crying her eyes out today, and I felt really bad. She brings her daughter to work quite often and we love her here. She is a wonderful kid, and we were all really sad with the news. I was hoping to shed a little bit of light, maybe some information on what their options are. They have to wait until October for their doctor to talk to them about the subject while her daughter still has seizures and her parents just suffer. I wanted to brighten up her day, and even if the news are bad or there aren\u2019t many options... at least I wanna give her some clarity. Any and all responses are welcomed.Thank you!",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about the little girl's diagnosis with grey matter heterotopia. It's completely understandable that you and your coworkers are concerned and want to help. I'd be happy to provide some information that might be helpful.\n\nGrey matter heterotopia is a rare neurological condition where there are abnormal collections of grey matter (brain tissue) in the brain. It can cause seizures, developmental delays, and other symptoms. The condition can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired due to brain injury or other factors.\n\nSince the little girl has seizures, it's likely that her doctors are already managing her symptoms with medication. However, the fact that she still has seizures suggests that they might need to explore other treatment options.\n\nRegarding treatment options, they might include:\n\n1. **Medication adjustments**: The doctor might need to adjust her medication regimen to better control her seizures.\n2. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery might be necessary to remove the abnormal grey matter or to help control seizures.\n3. **Vagus nerve stimulation**: This involves implanting a device that stimulates the vagus nerve to help reduce seizures.\n4. **Ketogenic diet**: A special diet that has been shown to help reduce seizures in some people.\n\nIt's essential to note that every individual with grey matter heterotopia is unique, and the best course of treatment will depend on the specific characteristics of her condition.\n\nIt's great that you want to support your coworker and her family during this challenging time. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Listen and be present**: Sometimes, all someone needs is someone to listen to them without judgment.\n2. **Offer practical help**: You could offer to help with errands, childcare, or household tasks to alleviate some of the stress.\n3. **Provide emotional support**: Let your coworker know that you're there for her and that you care about her and her family.\n4. **Help them prepare for the doctor's appointment**: You could help them write down questions or concerns to discuss with the doctor in October.\n\nRemember to respect their boundaries and avoid pushing them to talk about things they're not ready to discuss.\n\nI hope this information helps, and please give your coworker a big hug from me. I'm sure she appreciates your kindness and support during this difficult time.\n\nHow can I help you further? Do you have any specific questions or concerns?"

        "question": "25F, 200lb, 5\u20194, asthma, current medications wellbutrin SR, vyvanse, lexapro, montelukast, spironolactone. i do not drink any alcohol, use cannabis 5-7x a weekOccasionally, I will have an intense sensation of deja vu, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as disoriented. It\u2019s almost like a combination of intense nausea, dizziness, and confusion, which will be very intense for a few seconds before dissipating. After the initial peak, I will feel \u201cweird\u201d for anywhere between 10 mins to a half hour afterwards, sometimes I will be nauseous for awhile, sometimes I will need to lay down, sometimes I feel too overwhelmed to socialize, etc. (I do sometimes experience deja vu WITHOUT the weird sensations too, just the general feeling of unease that comes with a cognitively dissonant experience like deja vu.)This used to happen a lot more as a kid, and stopped for awhile, but recently it\u2019s happened once or twice and made me wonder why it happens. When I was younger I think I used to be able to \u201ccontrol\u201d whether it progressed if I caught the sensation early enough? For example, if I started having that \u201cI\u2019ve been here before\u201d feeling, if I leaned into it and tried to figure out if it was a dream, what came next, etc, the strange feelings would come on; occasionally if I tried to move on from the topic it would just stop at the deja vu and leave me just a little bit weirded out by the experience.I do tend to remember my dreams very vividly, and I have read online that people who do tend to be more susceptible to deja vu. Occasionally I can even tell when I have the sensation and am in fact experiencing the set-up to a dream (i.e opening a closet and then waiting for the \u201cnext scene\u201d so to speak from the dream). I am just curious if this is normal, if these weird feelings are just part of deja vu or if it\u2019s something else?",

        "answer": "The fascinating phenomenon of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! I'll try to provide you with some insights, but please keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, and it's always best to consult a doctor or a neurologist for a personalized evaluation.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a common, yet not fully understood, psychological phenomenon where a person feels like they've already experienced a situation or event before, even if they know that they haven't. It's estimated that up to 70% of people experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at some point in their lives.\n\nThe sensations you describe, such as disorientation, nausea, dizziness, and confusion, are not uncommon accompaniments to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Some people may experience a range of physical and emotional sensations, including:\n\n1. **Anxiety or unease**: Many people feel a sense of discomfort or anxiety during a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episode.\n2. **Dissociation**: Feeling detached from one's body or surroundings, which can contribute to the sense of disorientation.\n3. **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, stomach discomfort, or other gastrointestinal issues may occur in some individuals.\n4. **Sensory alterations**: Changes in perception, such as feeling like time is slowing down or speeding up, or experiencing unusual sensory sensations (e.g., tingling, numbness).\n\nThe fact that you've experienced d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu more frequently in the past and have noticed a possible connection to your dreams is interesting. Research suggests that:\n\n1. **Dream recall**: People who remember their dreams more vividly, like you, may be more prone to experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n2. **Neurological factors**: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu has been linked to abnormal brain activity in areas responsible for attention, memory, and perception, which might be influenced by the same factors that contribute to vivid dream recall.\n\nAs for the feeling of being able to \"control\" the progression of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it's possible that your brain is using various strategies to process and cope with the experience. This might involve:\n\n1. **Attention and focus**: By leaning into the experience and trying to make sense of it, you may be influencing the duration and intensity of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n2. **Self-reflection and metacognition**: Your brain may be using self-reflection and metacognition to try to understand the experience, which could affect the way you perceive and respond to it.\n\nRegarding your medications and cannabis use, it's essential to note that:\n\n1. **Medications**: Some medications, such as those you're taking (e.g., Wellbutrin, Vyvanse), can influence neurological function and potentially contribute to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or other unusual experiences.\n2. **Cannabis use**: While cannabis is not typically associated with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it can alter perception, memory, and cognitive processing, which might interact with your existing neurological tendencies.\n\nTo better understand your experiences, I recommend keeping a **detailed journal** to track:\n\n1. When d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes occur\n2. Triggers or potential precursors (e.g., stress, fatigue, certain activities)\n3. Associated sensations and symptoms\n4. Any factors that seem to influence the duration or intensity of the experience\n\nConsulting a **neurologist or a psychologist** can help you:\n\n1. Rule out any underlying neurological conditions that might be contributing to your experiences\n2. Discuss potential connections between your medications, cannabis use, and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n3. Explore strategies to manage and cope with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes\n\nRemember, while d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu can be unsettling, it's a relatively common and usually harmless phenomenon. By tracking your experiences and seeking professional guidance, you can gain a deeper understanding of what you're experiencing and develop ways to manage any associated discomfort."

        "question": "\u2019m a 60yr old fit male with Gerd due to a Hiatal hernia. Have been on PPIs for 22 years. Have had a history of passing out on occasion after weight lifting/working out. Doctors did cardio tests /tilt table with no results for explanation. One neurologist said I had epilepsy another one said absolutely not. No one seemed to take into account the PPI and Gerd condition and that this only happened after work outs. Could the weight lifting be affecting the Vagus nerve and causing the light headedness and the seizure like passing out episodes?",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "I'll do my best to help you explore a possible connection between your symptoms, weightlifting, and the potential involvement of the vagus nerve.\n\n**Vagus nerve and GERD**\n\nThe vagus nerve plays a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including digestion, heart rate, and blood pressure. In individuals with GERD, particularly those with a hiatal hernia, the vagus nerve can be irritated or compressed, leading to a range of symptoms.\n\n**Weightlifting and vagus nerve stimulation**\n\nWeightlifting, especially intense or strenuous exercises, can stimulate the vagus nerve in several ways:\n\n1. **Increased intra-abdominal pressure**: Lifting heavy weights can increase pressure in the abdominal cavity, which may irritate the vagus nerve, particularly if you have a hiatal hernia.\n2. **Vagus nerve compression**: The increased pressure and constriction of the diaphragm during weightlifting may compress the vagus nerve, leading to abnormal nerve function.\n3. **Parasympathetic nervous system activation**: Weightlifting can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is regulated by the vagus nerve. This activation can lead to a range of symptoms, including decreased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.\n\n**Connection to lightheadedness and seizure-like episodes**\n\nThe stimulation of the vagus nerve during weightlifting may contribute to your symptoms in several ways:\n\n1. **Vasovagal syncope**: The increased vagal tone and stimulation of the vagus nerve can lead to a sudden decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, causing lightheadedness and syncope (fainting).\n2. **Seizure-like episodes**: Although the exact mechanism is unclear, some research suggests that vagus nerve stimulation can trigger seizures or seizure-like episodes in certain individuals, particularly those with a history of neurological conditions.\n\n**PPI use and potential contributions**\n\nLong-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may also play a role in your symptoms:\n\n1. **Nutrient deficiencies**: Chronic PPI use can lead to nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin B12, magnesium, and potassium, which can contribute to neurological symptoms, such as lightheadedness and fainting.\n2. **Gut-brain axis**: PPIs can alter the gut microbiome, which may impact the gut-brain axis and contribute to neurological symptoms.\n\n**Next steps**\n\nWhile this is a plausible hypothesis, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider to rule out other potential causes and confirm the connection between your symptoms, weightlifting, and the vagus nerve. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Consult a gastroenterologist**: Discuss your symptoms and medical history with a gastroenterologist to explore the potential relationship between your GERD, hiatal hernia, and vagus nerve stimulation.\n2. **Neurological evaluation**: Schedule a follow-up appointment with a neurologist to reassess your symptoms and consider further testing, such as EEG or vagus nerve stimulation studies.\n3. **Modify your workout routine**: Temporarily modify your workout routine to reduce the intensity and frequency of weightlifting exercises, and monitor your symptoms to see if they improve.\n4. **Consider alternative treatments**: Discuss alternative treatments for your GERD, such as dietary changes, anti-reflux surgery, or vagus nerve stimulation therapy, with your healthcare provider."

I never had these symptoms before when I had unhealthy habits but over the last year my pancreas has not been having a good time. Every month or 2 I get these very specific pains that I now know is mild chronic pancreatitis. It's never brought on by a change in routine, it's always random.",
        "pictures": {},
        "answer": "Thank you for sharing your detailed medical history and lifestyle information. It's great to hear that you've made significant progress in managing your anxiety through therapy and have adopted a relatively healthy diet.\n\nConsidering your current diagnoses and symptoms, here are some potential observations and questions:\n\n1. **Epilepsy and Kepra medication**: You're taking a standard dose of Kepra (levetiracetam) for epilepsy, which is a common and effective medication for seizure control. Have you experienced any changes in your seizure frequency or severity since developing pancreatitis symptoms?\n2. **Mild chronic pancreatitis**: The recurring pancreatitis episodes are concerning, and it's essential to investigate the underlying cause. Elevated lipase levels (70-100) suggest pancreatic inflammation. Have you noticed any triggers or patterns to these episodes, such as specific foods, stress, or physical activity?\n3. **Lifestyle and diet**: Your diet seems relatively balanced, with lean meat, vegetables, and fruit smoothies. However, it's possible that some foods might be contributing to your pancreatitis symptoms. Have you considered keeping a food diary to track any potential correlations between your diet and pancreatitis episodes?\n4. **Alcohol consumption**: Although your weekly alcohol intake is moderate (2-7 standard drinks), it's still important to note that even moderate alcohol consumption can exacerbate pancreatitis. Have you considered reducing or eliminating alcohol from your diet to see if it affects your symptoms?\n5. **Gastroenterologist follow-up**: It's crucial to follow up with your gastroenterologist to discuss the underlying causes of your pancreatitis and potential treatment options. Have you asked about any additional tests or investigations, such as imaging studies (e.g., MRI, CT scan) or genetic testing, to help determine the cause of your pancreatitis?\n6. **Vitamin and mineral supplements**: You're taking vitamin D and magnesium supplements, which is good. However, it's essential to ensure that you're not taking excessive amounts, as this can interact with your medications or worsen pancreatitis symptoms. Are you taking these supplements as recommended by your doctor or a registered dietitian?\n7. **Anxiety and stress management**: Although you've made significant progress in managing your anxiety, it's still important to consider the potential impact of stress on your pancreatitis symptoms. Are you engaging in regular stress-reducing activities, such as exercise, meditation, or yoga, to help manage stress and potentially alleviate pancreatitis symptoms?\n\nTo further understand your situation, I have a few questions:\n\n* Can you describe the specific pains you experience during pancreatitis episodes? Where are they located, and how long do they last?\n* Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation, during or between pancreatitis episodes?\n* Are there any other symptoms that occur with your pancreatitis episodes, such as nausea, vomiting, or fatigue?\n* Have you discussed your family medical history with your doctor, particularly regarding any potential genetic predispositions to pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal conditions?"
