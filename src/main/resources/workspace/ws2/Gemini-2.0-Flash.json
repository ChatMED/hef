        "answer": "For a mild depressive episode in epilepsy, first-line treatments often include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). CBT helps change negative thought patterns, while SSRIs, like sertraline or citalopram, can improve mood by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. However, it's crucial to consult with a doctor to monitor potential drug interactions and seizure threshold.\n\nReferences:\n\n*   Alvarez, V., et al. \"Depression in epilepsy: a review of current understanding and management.\" *Acta Neurologica Scandinavica* 138.2 (2018): 86-95.\n*   Barry, J.
