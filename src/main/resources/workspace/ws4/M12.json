    "answer": "Antipsychotics are not first-line for depression in epilepsy. Use them only if there is psychotic depression or comorbid psychosis/agitation. Prefer lower\u2013seizure-risk drugs (aripiprazole, risperidone; haloperidol). Use quetiapine/olanzapine cautiously; avoid clozapine if possible.
